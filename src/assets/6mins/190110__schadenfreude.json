  "intro": [
    "Do you take pleasure when someone undeserving of their success has a spot of bad luck? Not even a little pleasure? Well, if you do (like, apparently, most of us) you might like to learn the word 'schadenfreude' and the concept behind it. Rob and Neil talk about this German word also used in English and teach you new vocabulary."

This is about false cognates \u2013 also called false friends - words that look the same in two languages but have different meanings. So in English we have the word 'rat' but what does that mean in German? Is it\u2026"

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And studies have shown this feeling is quite normal \u2013 particularly when is happens to someone we envy.  If we see a wealthy celebrity suffering on a reality TV show, or are exposed for not paying their taxes, we feel good. We say they've had their comeuppance ."

      "author": "Wilco Van Dijk, psychologist, University of Leiden",
      "text": "People especially feel schadenfreude when they think the misfortune is deserved. Then the question is where this joy arises, is this actually joy experienced towards the misfortune of others or is it also at least partly about a just situation \u2013 that this misfortune of another actually appeals to a sense of justice . That's also the reason why we like the misfortune of hypocrites because if they fall down that also is a deserved situation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, so Wilco Van Dijk's studies found we get joy when someone's misfortune is deserved \u2013 there is justice \u2013 in other words, the punishment someone receives is fair."

      "author": "Rob",

She talked about how schadenfreude is a subjective thing \u2013 based on our feelings \u2013 and it's not as simple as deciding what is right or wrong. What word does she use that means to express sympathy to someone about someone's bad luck?"

      "text": "We don't really experience emotions, you know, as either-or things, it's not black or white. I think it's perfectly reasonable that we could genuinely commiserate with someone else's misfortune at the same time as a terrible sly smile spreading across our lips because, you know, something we've envied about them has turned out not to work out so well or whatever it is. You know, we have a much deeper ability to hold contradictory emotions in mind, much more so than your average moral philosopher would allow."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
