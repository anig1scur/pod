    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts \u2013 they let you know where you are. Visual landmarks also play a role, just as they do with humans. A landmark is something very easily recognised \u2013 a big building or mountain for example."

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "And what about this one: magnets are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a magnetic force."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles \u2013 it tells them where north is. It's thought they have some iron in their beaks."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So we have a few ideas \u2013 smell, landmarks , magnetic forces \u2013 but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?"

      "text": "Let's hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?"
    },
    {
      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol What they do when they are in a new territory is explore it in a very systematic way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they'll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that's lost its territory probably does the same thing. They'll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they'll either come across the territory or they'll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Cats have a systematic approach \u2013 which means they use a system . Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one \u2013 until they have a strong mental map of the place."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 a mental map is a map in your head \u2013 stored in your memory. And the area cats explore \u2013 their home area - is called their territory . Cats are territorial \u2013 which means their territory is very important to them."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue \u2013 which is a landmark or a smell \u2013 that tells it where it is. Well, that's the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don't have enough data \u2013 that's enough information about this."

      "text": "And can we say the parks are magnets in summer? A magnet is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel \u2013 but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: territory is a noun \u2013 the area of land that an animal considers to be its own."
