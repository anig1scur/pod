  "intro": [
    "In certain developed countries around the world, there is a stark difference in the availability of internet to different communities. In tribal lands, located in remote, rural and rugged landscapes, internet connection is often very patchy, or non-existent.  In this episode, Sam and Neil discuss attempts to connect these remote areas. Join us to explore this topic and learn the useful vocabulary you need to talk about it!"
