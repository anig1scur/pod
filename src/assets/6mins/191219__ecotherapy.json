      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Are you sure? Well, we\u2019ll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out. Now, the mental health charity, Mind, describes ecotherapy as a formal type of treatment which involves doing outdoor activities in nature. However, there\u2019s not one simple definition, it just relates to doing activities outdoors."
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Yes, it can involve doing many things, such as outdoor yoga or horticulture \u2013 another name for gardening. It doesn\u2019t involve taking medication, but instead it just develops a person\u2019s relationship with nature."

      "author": "Patricia Hasbach, clinical psychotherapist",
      "text": "I often think about ecotherapy as another tool in the therapist's toolbox. It's not a panacea . It's not going to erase somebody's pain or grief. But it is a powerful tool, you know. Traditionally therapy has stopped at the urban boundary."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So it\u2019s interesting that she describes ecotherapy as a tool \u2013 something that can be used to achieve something else. Here is can be used to help improve someone\u2019s mental health."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Ah, but she says it\u2019s not a panacea \u2013 so not something that will solve everything \u2013 it won\u2019t erase or get rid of someone\u2019s pain. But going beyond what she calls the \u2018urban boundary\u2019, and into the natural world, means there is another method for helping people."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Now, as we\u2019ve mentioned, ecotherapy can take on many forms \u2013 doing art in a forest or running on a beach are all therapeutic . They're things that makes you feel better or healthier."

      "text": "Well, it does seem the negative symptoms of urban life can benefit from a dose of nature \u2013 a dose is an amount of something. Let\u2019s get a good explanation from an expert. Environmental psychologist Birgitta Gatersleben also spoke to the BBC Health Check programme and gave two reasons \u2013 one of them, she explained, was something called \u2018 biophilia\u2019."

    {
      "author": "Birgitta Gatersleben, environmental psychologist",
      "text": "Biophilia , very briefly, is really an innate positive response that people have with life and life-like features.
