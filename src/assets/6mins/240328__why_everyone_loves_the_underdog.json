The underdog in a situation is the person who seems least likely to win. Nevertheless, with some luck and plenty of hard work, the underdog sometimes ends up the winner."

      "text": "Sport is full of underdog stories, minor teams and sportspeople who play with courage and end up beating the superstars and multi-million pound clubs. But if you were given a choice between your team being the favourite to win or being the underdog, it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019d want to be the favourite, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Well yes, being the favourite gives a team confidence. But maybe the fact that no-one expects the underdog to win is actually an advantage which could help them to a surprise victory. In this programme, we\u2019ll be hearing about an underdog football club doing just that, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Great. But first I have a question for you, Georgie. One of the biggest underdog stories in sports history happened in the 2015-16 English football season when a little known club beat top clubs like Manchester City and Liverpool, overcoming odds of 5000-1 to win the Premier League. But which club? Was it?"

      "text": "I\u2019ll guess it was Crystal Palace."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Georgie, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme. The English football Premier League is a good place to find underdogs. Each season the three best clubs in the second league are promoted up, while the three weakest Premier clubs are relegated down. One club that knows all about relegation is Luton Town FC."

      "text": "In 2009, Luton Town were relegated entirely from the English League . Slowly their fortunes improved however, and they've now become the first English team to progress from non-league to the Premier League. Here\u2019s Luton fan, Alex, talking about his team\u2019s chances to BBC Radio programme, Mental Muscle:"

      "text": "\u2026But some of these elite Premier League clubs will look down their nose at us and just think we shouldn't be there, and we are there on merit and we\u2019ve just gotta prove it this season. So we are the underdog, certainly financially, but on the pitch I don't think we will be."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Alex thinks some of the rich Premier League clubs look down their noses at Luton. If you look down your nose at someone, you think you\u2019re better than them. But underdogs, Luton, have done better than expected, even beating some of the big clubs like Newcastle United."

      "text": "So, you can find that when the newly promoted team comes up they've got high confidence 'cause they just come from a season of winning - so they've got the belief that they can do it. But on the flip side it's just as important to look at the top dog\u2019s performance who\u2026 everyone expects them to win, they\u2019re playing the newly promoted team. So we might think of Man City who might be about to come up against Luton Town\u2026 So what we can see from that is what in psychology literature is known as choking , and that's when pressure gets to an individual or a team and they underperform ."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Clubs newly promoted to the Premier League are used to winning and start the season confidently. On the flip side , they have to play much stronger teams than before. The phrase, on the flip side , is used to show the opposite, less positive side of something."

    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Of course it\u2019s not just the underdog playing, there are also top dogs, the most successful or powerful person or team. No-one expects underdogs to win and this gives them freedom to relax and play naturally. Top dogs, on the other hand, experience a lot of expectation, and this sometimes leads to choking , a sports term which describes the failure of a player to perform their best because of psychological pressure or social expectation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Choking causes teams and players to underperform, to perform worse than expected. It\u2019s also true that neutral fans - people watching a match when their team isn\u2019t playing - tend to support the underdog as well. In football, it\u2019s tough at the top!"

OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about the underdog , the person in a competition or situation who seems least likely to win."
