Neil and Georgina talk about how electrical systems differ from country to country and teach you related vocabulary along the way."

So although it\u2019s around 60 hertz, at any moment in time these three different areas, because they\u2019re not connected to each other, will be going at a slightly different frequency. There are bigger differences elsewhere. So in Japan for example, I think one of the main islands is at 60 hertz and the other half of Japan is at 50 hertz."
