      "author": "Tim Edwards, Honorary Fellow in Sociology at the University of Leicester",
      "text": "Women's shoes in particular kind of have this kind of transformative or even magical quality - they can do something for a woman, and it's quite difficult to kind of draw parallels quite like that with men in a sense of which it almost becomes something slightly otherworldly . However one views it, as something which is a kind of act of subordination or an act of empowerment etc, there is a sense in which your experience is changed - you are suddenly raised 3-4-5-6 inches higher, your balance is altered, your experience is transformed."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, he describes high heels as having a magical quality. He uses the word transformative \u2013 meaning a great improvement or positive change \u2013 so they transform or improve how someone looks."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, it's just sandals for you and sports trainers for me. In fact Tim Edwards says it's difficult to draw parallels with men's shoes. When you draw parallels between two distinct things, it means you highlight the similarities \u2013 but here he's saying it's difficult to find similarities. Men have nothing special to wear on their feet."

    {
      "author": "Tim Edwards, Honorary Fellow in Sociology at the University of Leicester",
      "text": "I think the issue with men and footwear is that if you think of more contemporary culture - I mean the guy who kind of wears overly- flamboyant shoes or shoes which are not black, brown or flat is viewed with a degree of suspicion - either in terms of his sexuality, or in terms of his work ethic - or in terms of his kind of general moral, well, you know, his moral standards in other kinds of ways."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "He mentions someone's work ethic \u2013 that's the belief that working hard is morally right. A man who wears flamboyant shoes may have a different attitude to work. It sounds like quite an old-fashioned view. Neil It does, and let's hope people don't judge you when you go out wearing your sandals and socks! But now, how about giving us the answer to the question you set earlier."

      "text": "I'm afraid not, Neil. The answer was 251 pairs. It's still quite a lot \u2013 that's 502 individual shoes and I'm not sure if he actually got paid for doing it."
