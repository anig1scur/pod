In fact a recent survey found that some Brits apologise up to twenty times a day. So according to the same survey, how many times per day does the average Brit say sorry? Is it:"

Since the British are famous for apologising it\u2019s no surprise that Louise Mullany started researching the language of apologising in Britain, at the University of Nottingham. Now a professor of sociolinguistics, Louise spoke with BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"

When politicians make mistakes they are expected to apologise, and failing to say sorry is a faux pas \u2013 a remark made in a social situation that causes embarrassment or offence."

      "text": "Most politicians hate apologising and with good reason. Saying sorry means taking responsibility, and the apology needs to be sincere. A good example of this is the apology Boris Johnson made to the House of Commons during the 'Partygate' scandal in the UK when he broke COVID lockdown rules and had to pay a fine - a sum of money paid as a punishment for breaking the rules. Here, Professor Louise Mullany, analyses the apology for BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"

      "author": "Professor Louise Mullany",

Eventually, Boris Johnson did apologise, but many people didn\u2019t trust him and he couldn\u2019t draw a line under the 'Partygate' scandal. If you draw a line under something , you try to move on from a bad situation and make a fresh start."
