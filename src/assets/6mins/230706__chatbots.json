I no longer phone a human but I speak to a \u2018virtual assistant\u2019 instead. Probably the most well-known chatbot at the moment is ChatGTP."

We are really primed to imagine a mind behind language whenever we encounter language. And so, we really have to account for that when we're making decisions about these."

But it does sound like a sentient entity \u2013 sentient describes a living thing that experiences feelings."
