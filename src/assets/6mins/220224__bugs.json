So, to actually get someone to put it in your mouth - the easiest way we find straightaway is to try maybe, a cricket cookie or a chocolate-chip cricket cookie where you have\u2026 we are using cricket powder so you don\u2019t actually see any insects whatsoever \u2013 you\u2019re getting the idea of eating them so people can deal with that a bit more than actually seeing the whole insect."
