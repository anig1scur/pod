The act of swimming naked is informally called skinny dipping . The world\u2019s largest skinny dip took place in Ireland in 2018 - but do you know how many naked swimmers went into the sea? Was it approximately\u2026"

However, it\u2019s something Donna Price, a volunteer at British Naturism, is keen to advocate \u2013 or publicly support. Here she is, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme, explaining why\u2026"

      "text": "We enjoy the feeling of being at one with nature . If you haven't actually tried being naked in nature, naked outdoors, when you can feel the skin, the warmth air all over your skin, it's such a lovely feeling. There is a great feeling of liberation and freedom once you actually try naturism - and I would never advocate for someone to actually go out for a naked walk as the first thing they ever did - I just would not do that! You've got to be comfortable in your own skin so you do it at home, in your own garden maybe if you can - get comfortable with yourself, actually start to feel that being naked feels normal, which to me, it does."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "So, for Donna, naked rambling means she has a connection with nature, she feels part of it and it makes her feel good \u2013 that\u2019s the feeling of being at one with nature . Hmm, but couldn\u2019t you do that with your clothes on?"

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Donna also told the Woman\u2019s Hour programme that going for a naked walk shouldn\u2019t be the first thing you attempt to do. You need to feel relaxed and confident with your actions first \u2013 or what we sometimes say is \u2018comfortable in your own skin\u2019."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, she says we need to get to feel that nakedness is normal. I suppose we were all born naked and it\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. And, in the UK at least, it\u2019s generally not against the law to be naked in public."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Hmm, I\u2019m still not convinced, but according to Donna Price, this freedom of expression is quite well received when she\u2019s out walking. Here she is speaking on the BBC\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme again\u2026"

They're not shock, horror majority of the time, I can guarantee that. A lot of people say just 'good morning' and carry on, some of them actually say 'gosh, you're braver than I am\u2019 if it\u2019s a bit chilly. A lot of them just say, ' I really wish I could do that' and usually we just say 'you can!'."
