Some scientists think classic combinations like lemon and lime, or strawberries and cream are so popular because their chemicals overlap in special ways. Sometimes this creates new, interesting and unusual flavours. So, what weirdly popular combination was invented by British chef, Heston Blumenthal? Was it\u2026"

Dr Berenstein compares these companies to a guild - an organization of people who do the same job or have the same interests."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Because it was so secretive and mysterious, people saw making flavours as a dark art - a method of achieving something in a clever but dishonest or wicked way. But this all changed after the Second World War, when the invention of processed food which could be bought in supermarkets, and kept fresh at home in the fridge, increased the demand for new and exciting flavours."

      "text": "So, essentially becoming a flavourist today is still an apprenticeship process. There's no academic path to it, right. Your training is on-the-job, working alongside a master flavourist at a flavour and fragrance company, or at some of the bigger food companies will have their own flavour divisions. It\u2019s a scientific profession for sure. You have to know a lot about chemistry, but it is a creative profession. At the very heart of this industrial food system, there are these craft artisans who are essentially designing molecule by molecule, the flavours that shape the way food is made to taste."

Although a background in chemistry is important, you can\u2019t study flavours at university \u2013 the training happens on-the-job , at your place of work, while you are working."

Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with a dozen which means twelve."
