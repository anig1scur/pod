  "intro": [
    "Our heart is an important organ in our body and something we must take care of. Healthy eating and exercise can keep it in good condition but is it still possible to die from being sad and upset - or what we might call 'a broken heart'? 6 Minute English discusses the subject and hears from an expert who explains if this can really happen."

      "text": "OK, we\u2019ll give you the answer at the end of the programme. Now back to the subject of broken hearts and if you can die from one. Dr Nikki Stamp is an Australian heart surgeon. She\u2019s written a book, helpfully called \u2018Can You Die From A Broken Heart?\u2019 She was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme Woman\u2019s Hour and was asked that very question. Does she think it is possible?"

    {
      "author": "Dr Nikki Stamp",
      "text": "Yes, short answer is yes. It\u2019s a little bit more nuanced than that. For most of us when we have a broken heart whether it\u2019s bereavement or a relationship coming to an end we will be fine. We\u2019ll muddle our way through it, we\u2019ll take not so good care of ourselves but we\u2019ll get there. However the physical effects still happen and it is a big stress on your emotions obviously but also on your body."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, no. She said it was a bit more nuanced . This means it\u2019s not a simple relationship. A situation that is nuanced has small but possibly important differences."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The other situation where we say people are broken-hearted is, as Dr Stamp said, when a relationship comes to an end. So if your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband wife or lover decides they no longer want to be with you."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So these are times when we use the expression to be broken-hearted. But thankfully, they don\u2019t usually lead to death. She said that usually we muddle through . This expression means that we get through our sadness. Maybe slowly and maybe we don\u2019t think clearly and don\u2019t make the right decisions \u2013 but in the end, we mend our broken hearts."
