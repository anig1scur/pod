They were ways in which you started to carve out your own identity so you know when Dan or I have interviewed people we talk about\u2026 we talk to musicians about their impressions and, you know, and their influences, and invariably it was siblings or parents. And you would raid those vinyl albums and you would self-select."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

People come here because they want to talk to somebody who's really knowledgeable about film. They want to have a recommendation or a conversation about the films they just watch. You know, they really want to discuss those things."

The format has been steadily increasing, thanks in part to the popularity of guitar bands, traditionally associated with records."
