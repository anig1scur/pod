And the major indicator of that in women is the waist-hip ratio. And the waist-hip ratio \u2013 the absolute ideal \u2013 what men find most attractive regardless of culture \u2013 this has been tested in many different cultures round the world \u2013 is 0.7 and that's really your classic hourglass figure. And the reason why that universally is attractive is because it's tied to the health of that individual. There's a very strong relationship between someone circulating oestrogen and testosterone \u2013 obviously you want the oestrogen to be high and the testosterone to be low for a woman to be fertile, and also her general health, so .7 is linked to lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of diabetes and certain sorts of cancers."

So we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner, and that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us."
