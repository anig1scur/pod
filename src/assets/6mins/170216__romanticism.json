    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, it's not your fault, Dan. The idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the zeitgeist , and many of these ideas still continue today."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Zeitgeist - the word comes from German and literally means 'the spirit of the time'."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, that's true. However, it's one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "True, it might not be a realistic benchmark , and by that I mean 'a standard from which other things are judged'. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be\u2026 and then we get disappointed by the real thing?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that \u2013 an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty , meaning 'practical details'. Details like work, stress, children\u2026 all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Not to mention, the fact that everyone is flawed , or imperfect, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Exactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "And if the relationship you are in isn't as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you're with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that's true for other people's relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them."

      "text": "Sure. The first word we had was movement - a movement is 'a group of people working together to support an idea'. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil?"

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the movement for equality \u2013 gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was zeitgeist - now, a zeitgeist literally means 'the spirit of a particular time'. What would you say that the zeitgeist is these days, Dan?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, I think there's a focus on personal freedom. There's environmental concern, and of course, let's not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was benchmark \u2013 a benchmark is 'a standard from which other things are judged'. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the benchmark for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have idealised \u2013 an idealised thing is 'an often imagined, perfect version of something'. Now, what three things would exist in an idealised world for you then, Dan?"
    },

      "author": "Dan",

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Next we have nitty-gritty \u2013 the nitty-gritty is 'the important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing'. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the nitty-gritty of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, you have to decide who's going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food  -  some people don't like this, some people don't like that. You've got to get the flowers right. Oh, there's so much to think about \u2013 makes you think that marriage might be flawed \u2026 and flawed is a thing which is 'imperfect in some way'. London's a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan?"

    {
      "author": "Dan",
