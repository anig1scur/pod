But tattoos can last a long time and... what do you do if you feel your ink no longer represents how you feel about yourself? Sam and Rob discuss body art and teach you some vocabulary."

With that comes the fact that you\u2019re going to get people who want to copy them or it becomes almost like a fashion thing, so we do see certain tattoos, sort of , becoming a trend and\u2026 yeah, so I guess it kind of dilutes that value a little bit, yeah."
