    "#MeToo has become an expression of solidarity among women to expose the truth about abusive sexual behaviour. The message went viral due to public support from famous Hollywood actresses, but the phrase itself was thought up years earlier by civil rights activist, Tarana Burke.

I have a question now about the origin of the MeToo expression. Although the MeToo message went viral due to public support from famous Hollywood actresses, the phrase itself was thought up years earlier by civil rights activist, Tarana Burke. What year did she first use it? Was it: a) 1996, b) 2006, or c) 2016?"

If you\u2019re going to talk about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s being successful, then we have to also talk about capitalism, right? Because it\u2019s the love of money and the desire for people to have money and what he represented. The bottom line is people value those things more than they value the humanity of the women that he was destroying their lives. It\u2019s about power and it\u2019s about privilege . At the end of the day, these are the two things we have to talk about dismantling ."
