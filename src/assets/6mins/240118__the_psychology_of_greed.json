And, of course, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary too. But first I have a question for you, Beth. You reminded me of a famous quote by one of history\u2019s greatest leaders: The world has enough for everyone's need, but not everyone's greed. But who said it? Was it:"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Beth, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme. At the neurological level, greed is controlled by the reward centre of the brain. Greedy people feel good when they choose the stuff they want, and this happens at the unconscious, emotional level of the brain, meaning there\u2019s little conscious awareness about how greedy actions might affect others, or be unfair."

      "text": "But what does this look like in real life? That\u2019s what University of California psychologist, Professor Paul Piff, investigated using the classic family boardgame, Monopoly. The game was rigged to give one \u2018rich\u2019 player an advantage by letting them roll two dice instead of one, and collecting twice as much money as the \u2018poor\u2019 player when passing Go."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, what happened when Professor Piff asked the \u2018rich\u2019 players why they had, inevitably, won the fixed game? Listen to the answer he gave to BBC Radio 4 programme, Seven Deadly Psychologies:"

They talked about how they controlled their own outcomes, they talked about how it was the decisions they had made that had led to their being ultimately victorious, and not that flip of a coin that randomly got them into that position of privilege in the first place. Now, I don't know that this is a perfect model for how privilege, success or wealth operates in everyday life\u2026 Some people indeed have worked themselves up by their own bootstraps and get what they have because they worked hard\u2026"

      "text": "In fact, it was the fixed game that determined who would win and lose, not anything the players did. Professor Piff uses the expression, the flip of a coin , to describe something which is based solely on random chance, like when you flip a coin into the air. Whether it lands on heads or tails is pure luck."

      "author": "Beth",
