  "intro": [
    "Death metal music is a kind of heavy metal which explores the themes of death and destruction. But does it inspire its fans to appreciate violence? According to a new study, it does not. The death metal band Bloodbath might sing about cannibalism, but its fans do not go and eat their neighbours. Neil and Rob talk about this kind of music and teach you some vocabulary."
