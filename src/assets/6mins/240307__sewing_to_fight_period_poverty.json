      "text": "And I\u2019m Beth. Menstruation is an issue that\u2019s not often talked about, yet every month it affects billions of women around the world. Menstruation, or periods, are a natural process that typically happen once a month when women and girls bleed from their vagina for a few days as part of the reproductive cycle. When this happens, women need special products like sanitary pads or tampons to manage the flow of blood and go about their day-to-day life."

      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Unfortunately, over 500 million people around the world either don't have access to these products or can't afford to buy them, and this is called period poverty. Period poverty has serious consequences, for example, girls on their periods not going to school affects their education, and women who can\u2019t work during their period have less income. What\u2019s more, it can cause health problems because, without sanitary products, its easy to get infections."

And, of course, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But first, Georgie, I have a question for you. Periods affect girls and women of reproductive age, that\u2019s roughly half the female population, or 26% of the global population. But how many people is that? Is it:"

      "text": "OK, Georgie, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Ella Lambert was a student at Bristol University when she started The Pachamama Project in 2020 during the first Covid lockdown. She\u2019d heard about period poverty and decided to put her lockdown time to good use by making sanitary pads, pieces of soft material used to absorb menstrual blood. Here\u2019s Ella explaining how her project got started to BBC World Service programme, \u2018People Fixing the World\u2019:"

      "author": "Ella Lambert",
      "text": "So I borrowed a sewing machine from a friend, I learned how to sew on YouTube, and then I just started making pads. And even now to this day , I can't sew anything else, only pads."
    },
    {
      "author": "Myra Anubi",
      "text": "Ella started making reusable sanitary pads which aren't a new thing. They\u2019re made from absorbent fabrics such as fleece and cotton sheets which means that they can be used over and over again after they're washed unlike disposable pads."
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Ella spent lockdown learning how to sew , how to join pieces of material by hand using a needle and thread, or with a sewing machine. In fact, Ella was so focused on sewing sanitary pads she didn\u2019t make anything else, and to this day , pads are the only thing she knows how to sew. Ella uses the phrase, to this day , to say: up to and including the present moment."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Sanitary pads aren\u2019t easy to make. The outer layer has to be soft because it touches the skin, but they also need to be absorbent , able to soak up liquids like blood and hold them. What\u2019s more, Ella designed her pads to be washed and used again, unlike most sanitary pads bought in shops which are disposable , designed to be thrown away after they\u2019ve been used."
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Ella\u2019s network of volunteers sewing reusable sanitary pads grew, and to date the Pachamama Project has donated tens of thousands of period products to refugees fleeing conflict in Syria, Turkey and Lebanon, as well as women here in the UK."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Plus, the project is helping in other ways too. Despite affecting so many people, and being necessary for life itself, many cultures consider menstruation unclean or shameful, not a topic of polite conversation. But Ella thinks her project is giving refugees the confidence to talk about periods, as she told BBC World Service\u2019s, People Fixing the World:"

      "author": "Ella Lambert",
      "text": "I have seen such major change in such a short short period of time. Like, the women originally who were distributing the pads would barely even speak about it and we had it behind a curtain, and now they\u2019ll chat away about the pads with their male colleagues, anyone that comes into the shop\u2026"

    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Before, most women refugees would barely talk about menstruation, they would only just, scarcely talk about it. But now they\u2019re happily chatting away , passing the time talking to other women, and even to male colleagues."
