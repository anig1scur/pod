According to a professor of economics at Colorado University, the initial of your surname may affect your life chances. The nearer to 'A' you are, the better.

However, some research has shown that if your surname, your family name, begins with a letter later in the alphabet, you could be at a disadvantage at school and in life. Before we get in to that though, a question. Where does the alphabet come from in its earliest form? Was it\u2026 a) Ancient Egypt b) Ancient Greece c) Ancient Rome What do you think, Sam?"

In the BBC radio programme Fry\u2019s English Delight there was a feature about the alphabet and how it can have a negative impact on your school life. Can you remember all those years ago when you were at school? What\u2019s the first thing that the teacher would do at the beginning of the day?"

This is where the problem starts, according to, ironically, Professor Jeffrey Zax, from the University of Colorado. The further down that list your name is, the less noticed you are by the teacher. Why is that? Here\u2019s Professor Zax."

      "author": "Sam",

    {

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Professor Zax describes this by saying that the intensity of the engagement diminishes . Diminishes means \u2018gets weaker\u2019, and the intensity of the engagement is the strength of the communication, the level of enthusiasm for being involved. So this is the start of the disadvantage which can subtly affect students throughout their school years and after. This was discovered after some research in the US in the 1950s. So what were these disadvantages? Here\u2019s Professor Zax again."
