    "Scientists have found some evidence that our weight is not just controlled by what we eat. Research published in the journal PLOS Genetics, explains how twin studies have shown that about 40% of the variation in a person\u2019s weight is influenced by their genes. Neil and Dan talk about diets and serve you a tasty helping of vocabulary."

Research published in the journal PLOS Genetics, explains how twin studies have shown that about 40% of the variation in a person\u2019s weight is affected by their genes. And also, why thin, but healthy people have genetic advantages in terms of maintaining a healthy weight."

Let's hear from the study's author, Sadaf Farooqi, who is Professor of Metabolism and Medicine at the University of Cambridge, and has been a pioneer in the genetics of obesity for more than twenty years. Obesity, of course, is where someone is very overweight, in a way that is dangerous for their health. Here she is speaking on the BBC World Service programme, Health Check. What does she say might be one of the benefits of this research for people who are overweight?"

Because people are very judgemental and tend to think, look if I can stay thin and control my weight why can't you? And what I would say to that is, well the data now shows that you're probably quite lucky in terms of the genes that you have rather than just being either morally superior or having better willpower ."
