    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Clever title. To short-change someone is to not give them what they are entitled to, what they deserve. And originally this phrase comes from paying for something and not getting the right money back. So if I buy something for \u00a36 and I pay with a \u00a310 note and the shopkeeper only gives me \u00a33 back, I\u2019ve been short-changed \u2013 it means I\u2019ve been cheated. And in the context of facing discrimination because you're not tall, 'Shortchanged' is a really good pun."

      "author": "Catherine",

Here's Tanya S Osensky again."
