  "intro": [
    "A retired journalist who founded a campaign to preserve the correct use of the apostrophe in the English language, is giving up his battle.  It's because he says \"ignorance has won\". We discuss what's causing the decline in the use of this punctuation mark and teach you some vocabulary along the way."

For example, if I see a sign for taxis at a train station and it says taxi \u2013 apostrophe - s \u2013 aargh! Why \u2013 why? The apostrophe is not used to show there is more than one, it\u2019s used to show there is a missing letter or that the word is a possessive \u2013 it\u2019s just wrong! So that does kind of make my blood boil."

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "OK. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re correct at the end of the programme. The apostrophe, it is true to say, is often misused. It\u2019s put where it shouldn\u2019t be and not used where it should be. Is it important, though? Does it matter? After all, in spoken English there is no difference between \u2018it\u2019s\u2019 with an apostrophe and \u2018its\u2019 without. \u2018Your\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re\u2019 \u2013 short for \u2018you are\u2019 sound the same. So what\u2019s the problem in written English?"

      "text": "In many cases there isn\u2019t a problem at all. There would be very little confusion. But I don\u2019t think that means we should just ignore the correct way to use them. Sometimes it can be very important to make clear if it\u2019s a singular or plural or possessive. Another important thing to remember is that in CVs and job applications a good standard of spelling and punctuation is expected. Get it wrong and you could miss out on a good opportunity."

Here\u2019s a BBC news report on the subject."

So if, for example, your holiday plans are up in the air , it means that there is some kind of problem and you might not be going on holiday after all. The person who founded The Apostrophe Protection Society is John Edwards. Now 96 years old he has decided to give it up. Partly because of his age, but also because he thinks that due to the impact of texting and social media he has lost the battle against bad punctuation. So why has it come to this? Here he is explaining why he thinks people aren\u2019t bothered about using correct punctuation."
