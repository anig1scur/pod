But there are also health risks to having children later in life, so in this programme we\u2019ll be asking: when are you too old to have a baby? And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

But these were no ordinary twins because Mangayamma was the oldest recorded woman ever to give birth. So how old was the oldest ever mum when she gave birth. Was she:"

Professor of reproductive science at University College London, Joyce Harper, has been studying the trend of women choosing to have babies later in life. Here she shares her discoveries with BBC World Service programme, Global Story:"

Now it\u2019s become quite normal for women in their thirties, as we see with the world data, there\u2019s many countries where women have their first birth over the age of 30. But this is quite a new phenomena\u2026 that\u2019s why this term \u2018geriatric mother\u2019 unfortunately still lingers."

      "author": "Beth",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The concept of older mothers is still quite a new phenomenon, and attitudes towards them are changing. Mothers over the age of 35 used to be called \u2018geriatric\u2019, a word many found offensive. Fortunately, this term is no longer used, but social disapproval of older mothers still lingers. If something lingers it continues to exist longer than usual or expected."

Rolling Stone, Mick Jagger, famously had his eighth child with his 29-year-old partner at the age of 73. So, are older fathers more socially acceptable than older mothers? \u2018Yes\u2019 thinks Professor Harper, as she explained to BBC World Service\u2019s, Global Story:"

      "text": "We do have a bit of a gender problem here because if this was a man in his sixties, seventies and even eighties, and he\u2019s fathered a child, most people would pat him on the back . But they\u2019d probably pat him on the back because he\u2019s absolutely got a much younger partner. But if we\u2019ve got a woman in her sixties, seventies or, God forbid , eighties having a child, then it does have a sort of shock reaction, and makes people feel uncomfortable."

A 70-year-old man can still father a child \u2013 he can make a woman pregnant who then gives birth, and most people would pat him on the back , an idiom meaning give someone praise or congratulations."
