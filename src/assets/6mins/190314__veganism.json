    "Veganism is a controversial issue with strong opinions in favour and against. However, these opinion are less based on facts than you might think. What are they based on? And how can we convince someone to change an opinion? Dan and Rob find out and teach you new vocabulary."

We've mentioned what a vegan eats but what about a lacto-ovo-vegetarian? Which one of these items can they eat? Is it:"

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, this is all part of the debate, Rob. There's always two sides to an argument and it's something that's been discussed on BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme. They spoke to Dr Jutta Tobias Mortlock, a senior lecturer in organisational psychology at London's City University, who explained why views about veganism are so polarised \u2013 that 'means causing people to divide into two groups with opposing views'."

    {
      "author": "Dr Jutta Tobias Mortlock",
      "text": "This issue touches on personal beliefs , and beliefs always trump facts and so, often when we talk about beliefs, we're touching on important values. Values are the things that guide our opinion over what's right versus what's wrong. And so whenever people argue over whether it's right or wrong to eat meat, they are in fact not debating the facts around this issue, they're actually debating the beliefs about what's moral or immoral about this."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "So it seems in the whole debate about veganism we are basing our views on beliefs. A belief is something we feel is true or real. Our beliefs are based on our values \u2013 those are the things we think are right and wrong."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And when we argue over the rights and wrongs of veganism, we base it on our values \u2013 not hard facts. We talk about our view on what is immoral \u2013 so what society thinks is wrong or not acceptable. But basically, there is no right or wrong answer."

      "author": "Dr Jutta Tobias Mortlock",
      "text": "If I'm working with you and I'm trying to get you to come round to my side, I might not focus on the central facts. I might focus on the peripheral stuff around how I'm constructing my argument. I'd look for ways of how they overlap as people, like what do they have in common? And that's a way to debate an issue such as this controversial one in a way to get people to feel connected to each other and to actually feel that they value each other as decent human beings."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Interesting! This is a more subtle way of winning an argument. She says we should focus on the peripheral stuff \u2013 these are the things that are not as important as the main argument but are connected to it."

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "So we could say we're looking for common ground \u2013 things that both sides agree on or at least understand. Dr Jutta talked about making both sides feel connected. And it's a good point. Even if you don't want to be a vegan, you should respect someone's choice to be one."
