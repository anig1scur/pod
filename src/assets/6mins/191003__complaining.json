      "text": "OK. Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme, and don\u2019t complain if you get it wrong! You and Yours is a BBC radio programme about consumer affairs. On a recent programme they discussed the topic of complaining and customer service with Giles Hawke from an organisation called the Institute of Customer Service. He talks about different sectors . A sector is a particular area of business. Which sectors does he say have most problems when it comes to keeping the complaining customer satisfied?"

      "author": "Giles Hawke",
      "text": "The sectors that probably have more problems than the UK average are public services, telecommunications, transport and service sector . And there are probably some inherent challenges within those sectors - they may have more impact on a day-to-day basis. Those sectors which are performing well \u2026 travel is performing well, retail is performing well, leisure appears to be performing well."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, some sectors , by their nature, are more complicated and more likely to cause problems for customers. Public services, for example, often don\u2019t have enough money or enough staff. Telecommunications systems, such as your internet connection, are very complicated and sometimes go wrong. Bad weather can affect transport, and so on. So an inherent problem is a problem that is part of the nature of the thing itself."

    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "So, those sectors are not performing well. We usually think of the word perform when we are talking about actors or musicians, but in a business sense to perform well or badly means to be successful or not, and, according to Giles Hawke, travel and retail are performing well in terms of customer service."
