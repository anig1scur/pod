These techniques raise the prospect of treating \u2013 even curing \u2013 some genetic diseases \u2013 and it's not science fiction."

Faulty by the way, means something that isn't working properly \u2013 like the faulty brakes on my bike."

And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip, gene editing could be important for treating or even curing inherited genetic diseases. For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders it offers the possibility that their faulty cells could be removed, or changed in the lab, and then put back."
