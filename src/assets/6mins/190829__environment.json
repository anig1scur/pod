The topic was featured on the BBC Woman\u2019s Hour radio programme recently. Madeleine Murray is from an Irish organisation that gives advice to businesses and communities on how to operate in an environmentally responsible way. She was asked about what she does in her daily life that other people could do too. What food items does she mention?"

      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Well, she says that her pet peeve is small packs of things. A pet peeve is something that you find particularly annoying. She doesn\u2019t like small packs because they use a lot of packaging for a small amount of product."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So she buys in bulk . Buying in bulk means 'buying a lot of something'. And if you have a lot of something like rice or pasta, you can always transfer it to different smaller reusable containers. She uses the word decant for this. So that\u2019s one area where we can all be a bit more environmentally friendly. Another area is reusing things that are perfectly good but which we don\u2019t need any more. Dr Tara Shine is a colleague of Madeleine Murray and she talked about how new parents often buy a lot of new things for their babies, which they then throw away when the child gets too big or too old. She suggests that it\u2019s better to pass these things on -to give them to other people."

The hand-me-down , pass-thing-on culture is really, really important in the world of kids and there are lots of things that can be passed down, whether it\u2019s toys or the equipment, or the high chair, whatever it is, all of that can be passed on and that\u2019s really important. It\u2019s saving someone else money. Most of these things are in good nick when we need to pass them on ."
