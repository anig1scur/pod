  "intro": [
    "Either used for treating phobias or just for entertainment, hypnotism has always fascinated us. One question that\u2019s often asked: can anyone be hypnotised or are there people - maybe you - who are less hypnotisable than others? Rob and Sam talk about the topic and teach you related vocabulary along the way."
