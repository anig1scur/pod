You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as 'to keep', one as 'to get rid of', one as 'maybe to get rid of'. Get rid of , by the way, means to remove something you don't want. It's the 'maybe' bucket that's tricky, isn't it? \u2013 You never know if you might need something in the future."
