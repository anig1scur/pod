      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Throughout history, humans have always walked and moved their bodies. Now, modern technologies like motorised vehicles and office jobs, mean we spend more and more time sitting. Modern life has engineered out the need for us to move. When you engineer something out, you design things in such a way that it is no longer required. For example, CD drives have been engineered out of laptops because downloads are more popular."

      "author": "Phil",
      "text": "Charlotte says humans are not used to sitting this much . Here, the words this much mean in such large amounts. It\u2019s a negative thing, one negative being the harm to blood circulation , the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels which carries oxygen around the body."

      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "When we sit, we stop using important muscles. This reduces blood circulation and causes a range of other effects like increased levels of glucose and fat, and decreased energy levels. The body uses 20% more energy when simply standing than when sitting down, and walking uses 92% more energy. And that\u2019s not to mention the damage sitting too much causes to muscle movement and blood pressure."

Everything is geared around sitting, it\u2019s organised towards that particular activity, and that makes it hard to stop.

Everything's geared around sitting, and as technology advances and it tries to make our life easier, it then leads to us sitting even more."

In fact, on average we spend 9 hours per day sitting down, that\u2019s about 60% of our waking life. So, remember to take regular breaks, even just a minute or two."
