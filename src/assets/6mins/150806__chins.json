      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "'B'. Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But the first thing to say is that humans are the only animals to have developed a chin. Let\u2019s listen to Dr James Pampush from the University of Florida. What word does he use to mean it sticks out?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dr James Pampush from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida ",
      "text": "Humans are the only animal that have a chin and by that I mean, you have this bony projection underneath your teeth that sticks out past your teeth on the lower portion of your jaw and it\u2019s such an unusual feature, that in a way it sort of helps define what it means to be human."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So he used the word projection which means something that sticks out from the main surface."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And the word jaw is used to describe the lower part of the face, which the chin is part of. So, we now know exactly what the chin is. But why did it develop?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Now from what I understand, Rob, it has a lot to do with when humans started to cook their food, so the food they ate became much softer. Therefore, our ancestors \u2013 that\u2019s the people related to us from a long time ago \u2013 they didn\u2019t need powerful jaws or sharp teeth anymore. And, strangely, that made the jaw drop and produced that odd piece of bone we know as the chin."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "But some time later the chin became associated with sexual attraction in men. Males with prominent \u2013 that means easy to see - jaws were supposed to be attractive to women. And men with small chins were thought to be unattractive or weak people. They were even called chinless wonders sometimes."
    },

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Chinless wonder, an interesting phrase! So, let\u2019s have a look at yours, Rob. Are you a chinless wonder? Mmm. Looks pretty normal to me. How about mine?"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, Neil, your chin is rather pointed if you don\u2019t mind me saying. But I\u2019m not sure what that means, to be honest. So, let\u2019s move swiftly on. Let's hear what Dr Pampush has to say about this. He uses a word that means this theory is likely to be true."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dr James Pampush from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida ",
      "text": "It seems plausible to me that chins emerged as some kind of feature and then later were selected to be sex ornaments. But not the presence of the chin but, rather, the shape of the chin being some kind of marker for sexual identity."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "The word chin has also given us some interesting expressions. A double chin , for example, describes loose skin hanging beneath the chin which makes people look like they\u2019ve got two chins! It\u2019s something that people don\u2019t like and often try to get rid of."
