Now, obviously one of the barriers can be that VR or AR headsets - so VR, I\u2019ve always been slightly sceptical about. I\u2019ve called it \u2018vomity reality\u2019 for a while because, frankly, I usually need a bucket somewhere close if you\u2019ve got a headset on me\u2026 and also, do I want to spend vast amounts of time in those rather unwieldy headsets? Now, I know they\u2019re talking AR as well and obviously that does not necessarily need a headset, but I think we\u2019re seeing some quite immersive environments coming out at the moment as well."
