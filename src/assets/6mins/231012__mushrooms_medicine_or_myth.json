However, I also think that for many consumers, the medicinal properties of certain ingredients, based on natural and holistic ancient wisdom , may be just as compelling, if not more so, than knowledge based on modern science and clinical trials, and I think many people, young people in particular, they\u2019re just really intrigued to give these ingredients a go ."
