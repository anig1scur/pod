      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Thanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What's difficult about it though is that we don't all find the same things offensive . Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Evan Davis",

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "If you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn't mean people don't have a right to be offended . Here's Evan Davis again."

    {
      "author": "Evan Davis",
      "text": "Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo . In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes ."
