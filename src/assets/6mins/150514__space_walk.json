      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "When Leonov left the capsule his spacesuit inflated \u2013 or swelled up \u2013 like a balloon because the pressure inside the suit was greater than outside.  This made it impossible for Leonov to get back through the door of the spacecraft, putting him in a life-threatening situation."

So if he\u2019s not able to get in quickly, he\u2019s going to die of oxygen starvation, um [\u2026] so he had the presence of mind to get on with all of this, got back in, swivelled himself round, managed to close the airlock, and then when the pressure was equilibrated was finally able to, you know, hug his compatriot up there in space."

      "text": "Well, they certainly weren\u2019t dry. The capsule touched down \u2013 or landed \u2013 hundreds of kilometres off course in freezing Siberia populated only by wolves and bears. Leonov had sweated so much on the space walk that his boots were filled with water up to his knees! Both cosmonauts had to wring out \u2013 or twist and squeeze \u2013 their clothes to avoid frostbite."
