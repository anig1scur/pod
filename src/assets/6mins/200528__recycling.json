  "intro": [
    "With countries shutting their doors to foreign recyclable waste and a lack of processing capacity in Western countries, is the recycling system broken? Neil and Georgina talk about the excessive reliance on recycling rather than reducing the use of plastics and they teach you related vocabulary along the way."
