  "intro": [
    "The UK government has recently introduced a small charge of 5p on plastic bags in English supermarkets to try to stop people using them. Neil and Alice take a look at the environmental impact of mass-produced plastic bags and plastic in general. They also teach some related vocabulary."

In some, biodegradable bags are backed by law."

We're also concerned this could end up being passed up through the food chain to food which is destined for human consumption so it could end up on your or my plate."
