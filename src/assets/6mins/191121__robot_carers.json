So, let\u2019s talk more about robots, and specifically ones that are designed to care for people. Traditionally, it\u2019s humans working as nurses or carers who take care of elderly people - those people who are too old or too unwell to look after themselves."

It does have hands, it can wave... when you ask for privacy, it does turn around and sort of cover its eyes with its hands but that's the most it does.  It doesn't grip anything, it doesn't move anything because we're more interested to see how it works as a companion - having something there to talk to, to converse with, to interact with."

It can wave or turn round when a person needs privacy \u2013 to be private \u2013 but it can\u2019t provide physical assistance . This means it can\u2019t help someone by touching or feeling them."

We know that money is tight - if robots become mass-produced there could be large institutions where people might be housed and abandoned to robots ... I do think questions of ethics need to come into the growth and jobs agenda as well because sometimes they're treated very separately."
