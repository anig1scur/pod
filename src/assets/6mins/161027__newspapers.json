What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions."

He says that news will be successful on any platform \u2013 digital or traditional \u2013 so long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're objective it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you rant you speak in an angry opinionated way about something."

What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines \u2013 not very long \u2013 but they're really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today."
