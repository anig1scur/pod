He designs and creates very exclusive and very expensive perfumes. In a recent BBC video he talked about the power of smells. What does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?"

We use it more frequently as part of the word de odorant , which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies. These odorants , he said, can act as the trigger or catalyst for these memories. Both the nouns trigger and catalyst refer to something that causes a particular response. So a particular smell can be a trigger or catalyst for a particular emotion."

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, he says that some scents give off a particular message. The phrasal verb give off is often used to describe something that we broadcast about ourselves without saying anything. So he\u2019s saying that our scent, our perfume, can give off a message about the kind of person we are and that we shouldn\u2019t underestimate that. If you underestimate something you don\u2019t give it as much importance as it should have, you don\u2019t take it seriously enough."

      "text": "Then two words with a very similar meaning: a trigger and a catalyst \u2013 both of which refer to something that can make something else happen. In this case it was a particular smell making us remember something from the past. So scents can sends us to the past. But they can also say something about our personality."

      "author": "Neil",
