    {
      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Diane Purkiss, children's author Interestingly there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult, or at any rate a young adult \u2013 a dark sort of genre. And that's natural because actually in the past fairy tales were told by adults to adults in William Shakespeare's time. It's only in the Victorian era that they become moral children's tales and it looks like we're going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them."

      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "That's right, Neil. And dark here means scary or frightening. The Victorians toned down this dark content \u2013 or made it less forceful. They also introduced a moral \u2013 or message about what's right and wrong \u2013 to the tales."

BBC Reporter: What, 6,000 years?! Dr J Tehrani: Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. BBC Reporter: Good heavens!
