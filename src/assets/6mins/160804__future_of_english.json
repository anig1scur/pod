      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Well, the subject of today's show is how and why the English language is changing. And teenagers definitely have their own code \u2013 including text speak when they're on the internet or using their phones. Fomo, bae, plos \u2013 do you have any idea what those terms mean, Neil?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "I've got no idea what you're talking about, Alice. They're pretty baffling \u2013 and that means 'hard to understand'. But that's the idea, isn't it? We oldies aren't supposed to understand!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Yes, exactly! Apparently, 'plos' means 'parents looking over shoulder' \u2013 which proves your point! Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms \u2013 and these change quickly. In a year, or even six months time, words that were once popular, have disappeared completely."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice \u2013 so I hope you're feeling up to the challenge, Alice. Can you tell me, what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it... a) nouns? b) pronouns? Or c) adjectives?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "I think it's a) nouns. The way we name things probably doesn't change that quickly."

    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And you're very right, Alice. The modal verb 'shall' is on the way out \u2013 meaning it's disappearing. Why do you think that is?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Well, perhaps it's because 'will' sounds more natural these days. Let's listen to linguist Bas Aarts, talking to writer and presenter, Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth , for his explanation."

      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London MR: Why would we lose 'shall'? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative. We say, you know, 'Shall we go swimming'? BA: Well, because it's in competition with 'will'. If you have two words that more or less express the same meaning, one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language. And in this case, it's 'shall'."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Bas Aarts there. And interrogative means 'a question'. So it's not just in nature that we get survival of the fittest \u2013 you know, the struggle for life \u2013 it happens in language too. Similar words are competing with each other, and some lose while others win out \u2013 or succeed after a fight. Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?"

    },
    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "OK, then, I shall. Let's talk about tenses. Progressive tenses \u2013 formed from the verb be and the suffix \u2013 ing \u2013 are usually used for ongoing situations, for example, 'I'm doing the show with Neil at the moment'. But its use has been increasing rapidly. Let's listen to Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts again talking about this."

BA: Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in, I mean, I sometimes call it the Big Mac progressive because of course McDonald's use that."

According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like 'I' and 'you' and 'we' evolve slowly \u2013 a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds. Similarly, number words evolve very slowly \u2013 our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago. Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly \u2013 and in five hundred years or so we'll probably be using different words to the ones we use now."
