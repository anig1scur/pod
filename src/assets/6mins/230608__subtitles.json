This can lead to mistakes - sometimes very funny ones, including a subtitle which appeared in an interview for the BBC Six O\u2019Clock News in 2019. But what did the subtitle say? Was it:"

      "text": "I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Of course, it\u2019s not just deaf audiences that subtitles help. The translated subtitles of foreign films are great for learning languages, letting you read a word and hear how its pronounced at the same time. And because subtitles describe everything, from monster squelches to bombs exploding, it\u2019s a great way to learn new adjectives. Here\u2019s subtitler Karli Witkowska explaining to BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth how her choice of adjective creates emotion for the viewer:"

It\u2019s creating an idea of what a sound is like and using a very, very descriptive word in order to do so."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Karli bases her descriptions on the film\u2019s genre \u2013 a style of film, music or book with its own particular set of features. The sound effects needed for a thriller like Stranger Things \u2013 creaking stairs and sudden screams - are very different from the sounds used in historical period dramas which are more upbeat \u2013 light-hearted and cheerful."

      "author": "Beth",
