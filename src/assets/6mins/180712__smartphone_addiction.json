According to one recent survey, half of teenagers in the USA feel like they are addicted to their mobile phones. If you are addicted to something, you have a physical or mental need to keep on doing it. You can\u2019t stop doing it. You often hear about people being addicted to drugs or alcohol, but you can be addicted to other things too, like mobile phones. So, Catherine, do you think you\u2019re addicted to your phone? How long could you go without it? Catherine? Catherine!"

And I must say, I find that to be true for me, especially when I'm watching videos online. They pull you in with more and more videos and I\u2019ve spent ages just getting lost in video after video."

If you do something compulsively you can\u2019t really control it - it\u2019s a feature of being addicted to something, you feel you have to do it again and again. Some tech companies, though, are now looking at building in timers to apps which will warn us when we have spent too long on them. Does Jean Twenge think this will be a good idea?"

If you do something in person then you physically do it \u2013 you go somewhere yourself or see someone yourself, you don\u2019t do it online or through your smartphone, which nicely brings us back to our quiz question.
