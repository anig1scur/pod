These Proms, or as they're also known, the BBC Proms, are the biggest classical music festival in the world, and they're held in London every summer."

And this is a long tradition, back, going through the Proms. And it's wonderful because it costs very little, and it means that almost anyone can afford to come to the Proms. So it is a wonderful place for all sorts of people to meet together, and by the way, it's the best place in the hall to hear the music."

      "author": "Finn",

    {
      "author": "Finn",

    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "Well, yes Neil. That's actually true. The whole range of music is becoming wider year by year. They also screen concerts to other cities, they hold lunchtime and children's concerts, they even play Indian classical music, like this type of thing..."
