But my question is about a very unusual style, a traditional English folk dance where performers wearing black hats and colourful waistcoats hit sticks together while moving in patterns. But do you know the name of this unusual dance, Beth? Is it:"

To me, it's just such a release and it's something that I definitely rely on to get the stress out of my body. And I now absolutely love to move. Any chance I get, I'll dance. Now, I know everyone is not a fan, 'cause some people can find dancing to be awkward or uncomfortable\u2026 and I've seen people who just avoid the dance floor at all costs , but dancing is so good for us and potentially our brains."

      "text": "That\u2019s a pity, Neil, because the benefits of dancing are huge \u2013 just ask Dr Peter Lovatt, also known as, Dr Dance. Over four decades he\u2019s studied how dancing helps improve brain function in everyone from children and adults to older people living with diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. Dr Lovatt\u2019s dance therapy involves spontaneous movements, closing your eyes and letting the music move you. It promotes divergent thinking leading to happier, more creative brains."

      "author": "Dr Lovatt",

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Julia mentions people who are sitting on the fence , who still haven\u2019t decided if they will do something or not, in this case, dance. Dr Lovatt\u2019s advice is simple \u2013 get comfortable, close your eyes and listen to some music. Soon, you\u2019ll feel a twitch, a small sudden and involuntary movement somewhere in your body. From there, it\u2019s only a few steps to dancing!"

Morris dancing is the name of the unusual English folk dance, not flamenco which of course is Spanish, or the Highland fling which comes from Scotland. OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with boogie, strut your stuff, throw shapes and hit the dance floor , all modern idioms meaning to dance."
