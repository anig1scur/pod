Gradually the levels of sugar in the blood increase until reaching the level of being diagnosed with diabetes.

But the sugar tax is a good example that has contributed in Mexico to a decrease in sales of sugary drinks. And sugary drinks \u2013 just one drink can sometimes represent more sugar than a person needs for the whole day."
