But what has caused this rise in popularity? Has it happened suddenly, or over time? And is Neil wearing high heels? Find out and everything and learn the related vocabulary."

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Yes! Society has relaxed its idea of what is considered formal or appropriate. In addition, we're told there has been a big streetwear trend. Streetwear is a style of casual clothing worn especially by young people from urban settings \u2013 that's the city."

There are now a lot of fabric trainers and if you've inherited foot problems, then that kind of fabric\u2026 they're wrapping around knobbly bits, and knobbly bits hurt."
