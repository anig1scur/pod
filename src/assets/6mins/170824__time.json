The time we use was based on the movement of the sun and it's roughly still in sync but\u2026 for many societies it wasn't at all relevant to know that it's four o'clock. They needed to know how much daylight have I got left, or when is the prayer time I need to observe for completely different reasons, and whilst precision is wonderful it's also very much a straitjacket. Everybody is dominated by\u2026 looking at the watch and smartphone all the time, when we observe people. So we basically became a slave to time."
