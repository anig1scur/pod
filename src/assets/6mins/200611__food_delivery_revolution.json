    "Takeaway apps are changing food culture - if in the past, food delivery meant having a pizza or a curry when you didn't feel like cooking. Now you can find dishes cooked by chefs at 'virtual' restaurants. Neil and Georgina talk about 'dark kitchens' and teach you tasty vocabulary."

Unlike apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat which connect customers to local takeaways, these digital \u2018dark kitchens\u2019 work as just-for-delivery restaurants. Inside, chefs cook in kitchens without waiters, tables or diners, preparing high-quality dishes ready for delivery straight to your home."

So strangely the delivery, the bike, has become a shaper of the foods we eat."
