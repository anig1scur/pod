  "intro": [
    "The octopus uses its senses of vision and taste like we do. Its large nervous system is a sign of intelligence. Philosopher of science Peter Godfrey-Smith wonders how the octopus - a solitary creature - became so smart. Neil and Catherine chat about this curious animal and teach you six items of vocabulary."

To start, here\u2019s today\u2019s quiz question. What is the correct plural form of octopus? Is it: a)    octopuses b)    octopodes  /\u0252k\u02c8t\u0252p\u0259\u028ad\u026a\u02d0z/ c)    octopi"

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "OK. I think this is a trick question. I think people think that it's 'octopi', but it's actually, there's a technical term for it, which is the correct term and that's 'octopodes'. But some people think, like children and stuff, they just put the plural 's' on so they say 'octopuses'. So I'm going for answer b) octopodes."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Wow! Listen out for the answer at the end of the programme, just to see how right or wrong you are. Now, apparently the octopus is a remarkably intelligent creature. They have the ability to solve some complex problems and in one famous case one was even able to predict the result of World Cup football matches."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, I\u2019ll leave that to Peter Godfrey-Smith, philosopher of science and author of Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness. He is quite a fan of our eight-tentacled friends. On the BBC Radio 4 programme Start the Week he said that humans and the octopus have a common ancestor . This is a term in science which means 'a creature from which both species evolved'. Like a very distant relative. How long ago does he say this common ancestor lived?"

      "author": "Peter Godfrey-Smith",
      "text": "We got the octopus as a very special evolutionary product. It\u2019s an animal that\u2019s removed from us by a lot of evolutionary distance. The common ancestor that we share with an octopus lived about 600 million years ago or actually even a bit longer than that. But it has a large nervous system in a range comparable to vertebrates ."

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "So what Godfrey-Smith is saying is that the squishy octopus has a nervous system which has some similarities to our own in that it's quite large."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And a large nervous system is a sign of intelligence. He goes on to talk a bit more about how we might be able to relate to the octopus. He talks about the protean nature of its body. Protean is an adjective which means 'adaptable or changeable', and the octopus's body is certainly that. Why might that be a problem for us?"

    {
      "author": "Peter Godfrey-Smith",
      "text": "The sensory world of an octopus has, in some way it\u2019s recognisable. They\u2019re very visual animals, they\u2019re very taste-oriented animals and those things make sense to us. But the absence of hard parts, the protean nature of the body and the sort of extent of the sensitivity makes it a hard thing to think about."

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "This is interesting, isn\u2019t it? So the octopus uses its senses of vision and taste, like we do, and this is something we can recognise, but what is tricky for us is that its form is so completely different from ours. The octopus isn't a vertebrate so it can change its form and its shape very easily."
