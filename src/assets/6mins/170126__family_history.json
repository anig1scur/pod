And I think it's pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme Who do you think you are, Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?"

Now, I think it's time for today's quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to decipher \u2013 or understand. So what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it\u2026 a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story \u2013 especially if it's connected with our own family. And these days, it's easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online."

If I look at this document here \u2013 it's a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father \u2013 the head of the household \u2013 Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family lore has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool."

And we're all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that's where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other."

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Else Churchill says it's likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you're related to Edward III is a waste of money."
