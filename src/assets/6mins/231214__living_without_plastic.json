The following decades saw a revolution as plastic became the most commonly used material in modern life, found in everything from cars to furniture to packaging. Take a quick look around and you\u2019ll soon see how many everyday items contain plastic."

      "text": "But now our love of plastic is being questioned, mostly thanks to climate change and pollution caused by single-use plastics \u2013 plastic products which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away. 11 million tonnes of plastic waste are dumped into our oceans every year. It\u2019s believed that single-use plastics make up 40% of all plastic pollution globally."

And because plastic comes from fossil fuels, the process of making it creates problems at every stage, from burning coal, to transportation, to recycling. In this programme, we\u2019ll be asking: is it time to live without plastic? And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

      "text": "But first I have a question for you, Beth. One reason why plastic became so popular is that it\u2019s a very flexible material. It can be formed into different shapes, making it useful for keeping food fresh, or holding liquid. Originally, plastic was invented to replace the decreasing supply of natural materials like metal, wood and glass. So which items did plastic first replace? Was it:"

      "text": "Hmm, I guess the first thing to be made of plastic was a hairbrush."

      "text": "OK, Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Dr Sherri Mason is Professor of Chemistry at Penn State University in the US, and a specialist in plastic pollution. Her award-winning 2017 research into microplastics in rivers led to the US Congress banning microbeads . Here, she explains the problem of plastics to BBC World Service programme, The Real Story:"

      "text": "Plastic is synthetic and, as a consequence of that, nature doesn't really know what to do with it. Like, a paper bag that's sitting on the side of the road - it's unsightly but within weeks there are organisms in the soil that can use that paper bag as a food source, right\u2026 they have evolved to basically chew up that paper bag and turn it back into soil, turn it back into carbon and nitrogen and oxygen. But with regard to plastic because it is a synthetic material you don't have that evolution. There are some organisms that can use it as a food source, but they're few and far between , especially when you're talking about water systems, aquatic systems and the temperatures that exist, and so they can't really use it as a food source so plastic doesn't biodegrade \u2026"

      "text": "Plastic is a synthetic material, meaning that it\u2019s made by combining man-made chemicals, instead of existing naturally. Natural materials like paper decay and harmlessly turn back into soil \u2013 they biodegrade . But plastic is not like this. It doesn\u2019t decay and get broken down by microbes and bacteria."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "In fact, some plastic-eating microbes and bacteria do exist, but these are few and far between , they\u2019re rare, and don\u2019t happen very often. It\u2019s the fact that plastic doesn\u2019t decay which is responsible for the waste we see in the environment, waste which is often unsightly , meaning ugly and unpleasant to look at."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Fortunately, help is at hand. The plastic-eating microbes Neil mentioned, especially one called Rhodococcus ruber, have been tested by scientists and seem capable of breaking down plastic into its basic components. What\u2019s also needed is an emphasis on reducing plastic production, especially packaging and other single-use products, rather than simply recycling. Action like this should help plastic achieve its original purpose \u2013 to help preserve, not pollute, our natural resources. And speaking of the origins of plastic, isn\u2019t it time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil?"

      "text": "Right. I asked you which object made of natural materials was the first to be replaced by plastic. You said it was a hairbrush which was\u2026 the wrong answer I'm afraid, Beth. In fact the first plastic-moulding machine was used in 1872 to produce snooker balls. OK let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with single-use plastics - plastic products which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away."
