But first, Georgina, I have a perfect question for you! According to the 2020 United Nations World Happiness Report, which country is the world\u2019s happiest? Is it\u2026"

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Now thinking of this \u2018ring doughnut\u2019 - the idea is not to leave anyone in the hole in the middle falling short on the essentials of life - but at the same time not going beyond the outer ring, because there we put so much pressure on our planetary home it can cause climate change. So, here is Kate Raworth speaking on the BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, talking about how Amsterdam is trying to fit into this \u2018doughnut\u2019 approach\u2026"

    {
      "author": "Kate Raworth, Economist",
      "text": "Amsterdam has started with a goal of saying we want to be a thriving , inclusive , regenerative city for all residents while respecting planetary boundaries - that's like saying we want our city to live in the doughnut. And that changes how you build - you don't bring in more new raw materials from across the other side of the world - you say, right, how do we re-use the construction materials that are already in our city to build new buildings? [\u2026] How do we change the way that people travel? Start asking very different questions from the outdated economic mindset that they were taught before."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Interesting stuff from Kate Raworth there. The people of Amsterdam are trying to live within the doughnut! Their aim is to live and look after each other without harming the planet. It\u2019s a big aim \u2013 but they want their city to be thriving \u2013 so growing and being successful."
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "And it wants to be inclusive \u2013 including everyone and treating them equally. This is beginning to sound like utopia, Rob! To achieve this, Kate talked about using locally-sourced materials for building and thinking about how people travel around \u2013 basically making it a sustainable city."

      "author": "Rob",

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Bert van Son sees the benefit of the doughnut economy by treating people fairly and with respect \u2013 the opposite is to mistreat . He thinks they should have things such as social security \u2013 a payment system by governments that helps people live a reasonable life."

      "author": "Georgina",
