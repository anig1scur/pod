    "Some people are always on time but others are always late - they never allow enough time to get somewhere. Lateness can also sometimes be attributed to an underlying fear of being early. Neil and Catherine talk about different people's attitude to being on time."

They are the people who arrive last at any meeting or class, or the mums whose children have to run into school at the last minute. They\u2019re the people who don\u2019t want to be late but they have a strange resistance to being early [like you] and they don\u2019t allow enough time."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "One thing that is guaranteed is you\u2019ll never be early. You have a resistance to \u2013 you fight against or are opposed to - being on time. Isn\u2019t it best to leave home just a little bit earlier?"

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, Neil, it\u2019s about deadlines \u2013 you know, a fixed time when something must be completed by. If a deadline really matters, I\u2019ll make it, but for less important things, it\u2019s not worth getting too stressed."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

But therapist Philippa Perry might be able to explain your more relaxed attitude to timekeeping. She also spoke about this on the BBC\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme. See if you can hear what her reasons are."
    },
    {
      "author": "Philippa Perry",
      "text": "Underlying it all, there is this fear of being early, and the fear could be a fear of being conspicuous , a fear of standing out in a strange place, having no one to talk to, feeling a bit alone and awkward \u2026 the other reason people are always late is\u2026 that all the traffic lights will be green, and they generally sort of stretch the time somehow in their minds and just think there\u2019s time to do absolutely everything they\u2019ve packed in."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, she thinks being late is to do with social awkwardness \u2013 if you arrive too soon you feel awkward \u2013 that\u2019s uncomfortable or nervous, waiting for others to arrive."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "There\u2019s also the fear of being conspicuous \u2013 easily noticed or standing out in a crowd. It\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling, but that\u2019s not why I might be late. It\u2019s the other reason Philippa Perry mentioned. I just think there\u2019s time to pack everything in! But if it makes you happy, I will try to be on time next time."
