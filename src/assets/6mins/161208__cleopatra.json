Here's Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford, with more about this."

She had a very beautiful voice, which I think is a quality that we perhaps underrate these days, in estimations of celebrity, and she clearly had masses of charisma; the sort of person who would light up a room; so, enormous personal charm."

And charisma is, in other words, a strong power to attract people. Cleopatra's voice was also considered very attractive \u2013 an attribute we underrate today, according to Susan Walker."

Mark Anthony had fatally wounded himself when he heard, mistakenly, that Cleopatra was dead. But before he died, he managed to get back to Cleopatra, who held him in her arms as he died, in her family tomb. Then she decided to take her own life."

She takes her time, she has a feast, and then, you know, the figs, the basket of figs arrives with the asp in it \u2013 or was it perhaps a poisoned hairpin \u2013 there's a certain amount of uncertainty about the exact method of her death. I think most sources prefer the snake."

She may have used a snake to bite her, smuggled into her room in a basket of fruit \u2013 but it may have been a poisoned hairpin \u2013 or simply a cup of poison. But she did it in a calculated \u2013 or carefully planned \u2013 way."
