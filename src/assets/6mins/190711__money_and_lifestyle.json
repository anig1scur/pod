Recently they were talking about lifestyle financial planning, which is planning your finances to meet the kind of lifestyle you want to have. Julie Lord leads a financial planning organisation and she talked about the process of lifestyle financial planning. How many numbers does she say you need to start with?"

I kind of think I\u2019m much too young to worry about it now and that as if by magic it will all work out in the end. So it would be difficult for me to come up those four numbers.
