      "text": "What a good question! Well, extroverts are confident in their personality. They're outgoing and comfortable in social situations. So, I would have to say that, if anything, I\u2019m the opposite. I\u2019m more of an introvert . I\u2019m really quite shy. I feel uncomfortable in social situations. For example, if I go to a party, where I don\u2019t know anyone I usually feel very embarrassed and I find it impossible to start conversations with strangers."

She was interviewed on the BBC Radio programme All In The Mind. She spoke about an experiment in which they tracked the eye movements of people in real situations. This is what she said about the research. Was she confident the experiment would work in the real world?"

Unconstrained here means that there wasn\u2019t strict control over the conditions of the experiment. It took place in the \u2018real-world\u2019 \u2013 so not in a laboratory."

      "author": "Sabrina Hoppe",
      "text": "We still don't really know in detail what makes the difference. We can only tell that there are differences and that we know computer programs that can pick up those differences. Maybe extrovert people look up a lot because they want to look at people's faces, whereas some super introvert person maybe just stares at their own shoes, if you want to take the extreme examples. So, probably it somehow changes gaze. But we only know that this information is there and somehow our program figured out how to extract it."

Gaze is another word for looking at something. So maybe we gaze in different ways depending on our personality. Extroverts may look up more and introverts, like me, may look down more."

The phrasal verb to figure something out means 'to understand or realise something'.  Time to review today\u2019s vocabulary, but first, let\u2019s have the answer to the quiz question. I asked what are the letters AI? Are they"
