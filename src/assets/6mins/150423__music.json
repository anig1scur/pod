There's French music playing behind the counter - more than likely you'll go for a glass of French wine. German music behind the counter - your likelihood of choosing German wine goes way, way up. If they're playing classical music you might be tempted to spend that little bit more."

A fast tempo gets customers in and out quickly at busy times. On the other hand, if there aren't many customers, the restaurant might want to keep people in the place for longer. So they put on music with a slow tempo to create a more relaxed atmosphere."
