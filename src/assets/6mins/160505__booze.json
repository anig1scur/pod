The main process involved in producing alcohol is fermentation , which is the process in which yeast or bacteria changes sugar into alcohol. Hydration is the process of making your body absorb water. And purification is the act of removing some harmful things from something. Actually, have this glass of water, Rob. Hydration is a good hangover cure \u2013 much better than hair of the dog."
