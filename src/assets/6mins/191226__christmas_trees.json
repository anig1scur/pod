    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Well before we answer that, let\u2019s hear from some of the BBC Learning English team who  chose to have a real Christmas tree in their home and find out why\u2026 Phil Well, you've got the smell of it. You've got the look of it. But more importantly, it\u2019s Christmas trees are supposed to be symbolic , aren't they? So the idea of something that stays green all year, so bringing that into your house it, it means something."

    {
      "author": "Jiaying",

      "text": "There\u2019s something more beautiful about the nature, the smell, the feel, the look of the tree and I like it to be sustainable . So, as long as I get my tree from a person that promises to grow two or three in its place, then I'm really, really happy."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, I agree \u2013 you can\u2019t beat having a real Christmas tree. And as Phil said, it\u2019s symbolic \u2013 it represents something important \u2013 and here a Christmas tree is the symbol of Christmas."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "And as Jiaying mentioned, it\u2019s a tradition \u2013 something that\u2019s done regularly and has become the expected thing to do \u2013 and I\u2019d agree it makes things more festive \u2013 a word to describe the joyful feeling you get when celebrating something like Christmas."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But of course all these trees are often thrown away, which is wasteful. That's why Roy mentioned his tree being sustainable \u2013 which means they can continue to be grown and cut down over a longer period so it\u2019s less harmful to the environment."

    {
      "author": "Sam",

    {
      "author": "Feifei",
      "text": "We have a plastic Christmas tree, which we've had for about nine years. So it's plastic so you can re-use it every year and it's more economical , and we don't have to keep buying new trees."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So Feifei\u2019s fake tree is made of plastic \u2013 so that\u2019s not great for recycling \u2013 but the good thing is she uses it year after year which makes it economical \u2013 which means it doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money, it\u2019s good value."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Ah, but even Feifei admits it doesn\u2019t have the smell and feel of a real tree. It\u2019s a dilemma isn\u2019t it, Neil?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 what\u2019s best for us and what\u2019s best for the environment? The BBC\u2019s Reality Check programme found that real trees take about 12 years to grow and as they do, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere and nitrogen from the soil \u2013 so a good thing."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "But when it\u2019s chopped down it starts to release emissions back into the atmosphere \u2013 especially if you have to transport it to your home. And when Christmas is over, if it ends up in landfill, the tree\u2019s carbon footprint will be higher."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But its carbon footprint will be lowered if it\u2019s recycled or composted \u2013 that\u2019s the process of allowing it to decay and then adding it to the ground to improve soil quality. A fake tree on the other hand is usually imported, and can\u2019t usually be recycled but, as Feifei mentioned, it can be re-used.  But without any type of Christmas tree, where would we put all those lights I mentioned earlier, Sam? I asked you: In 2010, a Christmas tree in Belgium was awarded the world record for having the most lights on it \u2013 but did you know how many? What do you say, Sam?"
