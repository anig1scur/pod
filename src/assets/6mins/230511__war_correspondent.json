Fergal\u2019s reporting helped his television audiences make sense of the horrors of war, but underneath there were more personal reasons attracting him to the frontline."

Something similar to PTSD is mentioned in Viking sagas and in stories about both World Wars. So, what was the name of the PTSD-like condition suffered by many soldiers during the First World War? Was it: a)    nostalgia? b)    shell shock?  or, c)    combat stress?"

      "text": "OK, Sam, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Fergal Keane, who was born in Ireland, had seen violence ever since the early days of his career covering the fighting in Belfast. He had already reported from wars all over the world when, in 1994, he was sent to cover the civil war in Rwanda. But what Fergal saw there shocked him like nothing before, as he told Mobeen Azhar, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Lives Less Ordinary."
