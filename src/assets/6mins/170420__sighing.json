Because people who don\u2019t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism ."

      "author": "Dan",

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "So, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism ?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "It\u2019s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone."

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "OK, that\u2019s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs?"

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, scientists from UCLA, that\u2019s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Thankfully, we don\u2019t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex ."

      "text": "Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster \u2013 so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans."
