    "The 2020 presidential elections in the US, in which President Donald Trump faces the Democrat candidate Joe Biden, are causing a lot of controversy. In the US many votes are cast digitally and there are plans to enlist the help of hackers to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks on election day. Rob and Sam discuss the initiative and teach you vocabulary along the way."
