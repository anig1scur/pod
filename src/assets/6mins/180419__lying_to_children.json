      "author": "Dr Chris Boyle",
      "text": "A white lie is just a distortion of the truth without malicious intent \u2013 as long as there's not malicious intent I think it's something that we do. It's almost a societal norm that it's become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "A white lie . He says a white lie is just a distortion of the truth. Distortion here means a changing or bending of the truth. These kind of lies are OK as long as we don\u2019t tell them because we want to hurt someone."

      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, something that is the norm is something that is expected, it\u2019s regular and usual.The adjective societal comes from the noun society. So a societal norm is something that is regular and common in your culture or society."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Mmmm. This makes me think of the next expression, ' malicious intent' . Intent is the reason or purpose for doing something, and doing something with a malicious intent is doing it deliberately to be cruel or to hurt someone. I think you have a malicious intent , telling me that when you say I look nice, it\u2019s just a lie!"
