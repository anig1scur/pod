  "intro": [
    "We often think about Charles Darwin as the man who developed ideas about evolution but another man discovered the ideas 27 years before him. Rob and Neil tell us about Patrick Matthew and the reasons why he is not as famous - whilst teaching some related vocabulary."

    "What was Patrick Matthew's job? Was he...",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "OK. We\u2019ll find out later whether you are right or wrong. But let\u2019s listen now to Dr Mike Weale talking about Patrick Matthew. Can you hear the word he uses to mean 'change-making'?..."

      "text": "Dr Mike Weale, geneticist at King\u2019s College London He published a brief outline of the idea of species being able to change into other species through natural selection \u2013 this great, transformative idea that unites us all in a single tree of life. And he did that 27 years before Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace did so. And they recognized that he did so but other people since then have simplified the story and tended to concentrate just on Darwin."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, Matthew believed that evolution happened by natural selection. And natural selection describes the way that plants and animals adapt to their environment, because some individuals survive and reproduce, and others don\u2019t."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, the basic idea behind evolution is that all the different species \u2013 or types of living thing \u2013 have evolved from the same simple life form. Just like a family tree describes how the members of your family are related to each other, so the \u2018tree of life\u2019 describes how all living things are related."

      "text": "A good question, Neil. We heard in the clip that Darwin acknowledged \u2013 or accepted - Matthew\u2019s claim to the idea. But it seems to be down to us \u2013 the general public \u2013 wanting to simplify things."

Here\u2019s Dr Patricia Fara, senior tutor at Clare College Cambridge. She tells us why Darwin was so successful. And listen out for the word she uses to mean close friends and supporters."

And although he was publishing from his stronghold down in Kent he had the most famous, most prominent, eminent members of the scientific society in Victorian times who were pushing on his behalf. Having a scientific theory being accepted is not just a matter of whether the theory\u2019s right."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes. And that was the right answer \u2013 so well done! Just to remind you: a horticulturalist is a person whose job is to study and grow plants such as flowers, fruit and vegetables. But Matthew was interested in trees too. In fact, his ideas about evolution appear in an appendix \u2013 or section giving extra information \u2013 at the end of a 200-page book about wood!"
