      "text": "Well, that\u2019s an interesting point, Sam, because in today\u2019s programme we\u2019re discussing crying. We\u2019ll be investigating the reasons why we cry and looking at some of the differences between men and women and between crying in public and in private. And of course, we\u2019ll be learning some related vocabulary along the way."

    {
      "author": "Sam",

      "author": "Neil",

According to a study from 2017 conducted in the UK, on average, how many times a year do women cry? Is it: a)     52 b)     72,   or c)     102"

      "author": "Sam",

    {
      "author": "Neil",

If you\u2019ve got somebody who seems to cry regularly, I think that\u2019s not helpful for the individual because then if they cry over something that really is important to them, they might not be taken so seriously - or they get a label. But I do think crying is often a build-up of frustration and undealt-with situations and it\u2019s a bit of a final straw moment."
