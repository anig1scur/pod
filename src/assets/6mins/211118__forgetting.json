The odds of remembering something after a one-off are incredibly slim\u2026unless you can immediately link it to something you already understand \u2013 so, my middle name is Cuney\u2026 if I ever meet someone named Cuney I\u2019ll never forget that \u2018cos I have an immediate link\u2026 but if I meet someone named Joe\u2026 so a one-off, we all pretty much suck at it - unless we focus. So then rule two then becomes, we remember what we focus on."
