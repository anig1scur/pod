      "text": "Well, funnily enough, unicorns are the topic of this programme. Before we learn more though, a question. What do we call the study of legendary creatures like the Loch Ness Monster, Big Foot and unicorns? Is it: a) Cryptozoology, b) Protozoology, or c) Paleozoology? Have you got any idea about that, Rob?"

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Ah, well, I know this because it was the topic of a 6 Minute English programme a while back, in 2008, to be exact. So I think I'll keep the answer to myself."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, well for everyone else, we'll have the answer later in the programme. Over the last few years unicorns have been popping up all over the place - on T-shirts, in movies, as toys and even in political conversations. Why is this? Natalie Lawrence is a natural historian. She appeared on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme to discuss the topic. Listen out for the answer to this question: Why does she say people used to drink out of unicorn horns?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Natalie Lawrence",
      "text": "Those original stories were developed in a time when magic actually existed in the world. The world was still very enchanted \u2026 the idea that the unicorn is a very strong animal and also that could achieve magical feats , so unicorn horn used to be seen as a panacea for all sorts of ills and a guard against poison. So people used to drink out of unicorn horn cups to prevent themselves getting poisoned, and I think that idea of it being magical and having magical powers has still come through today."

      "text": "Why did they drink from unicorn horn cups?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, they were supposed to have magical powers so people drank from them so they wouldn't get poisoned."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, she said they could perform magical feats . A feat is something that is difficult to do or achieve - like recording this programme without making a mistake, that's a real feat!"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, we usually do it. It must just be unicorn magic."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "No, just the magic of editing, Rob! Now, she also said that unicorn horn was seen as a panacea . What does that mean?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "A panacea is another word for a cure - something that can protect you from illness or help you recover if you are sick. But is all this true, about the unicorn horn?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, seeing as how unicorns don't and never have existed, it's unlikely to be true. She says these stories come from a time when the world was enchanted . This means it was a time when people believed in magic and the possibility of mysterious creatures from mysterious parts of the world. It seems as if these days people are looking for a bit of magic, a bit of enchantment in their lives. The unicorn has also come to be a term commonly used in politics to refer to unrealistic ideas and plans. Why is this? Here's Natalie Lawrence again."
