We\u2019ll find out the reasons for this shortly, but first, a question. Even though dating apps are not used as much as we might think, they are still big business, but do you know how big? Around the world last year how much was spent on them? Was it:"

      "text": "Well, we\u2019ll have the answer at the end of the programme. Elizabeth Tinnemans is a researcher who studied the use of a particular dating app. She spoke on the BBC's You and Yours radio programme on Radio 4. Her study confirmed that comparatively few people who used the app used it to arrange to meet up with someone. She talked about people\u2019s motives for using the app. Motives isa word which means\u2018reasons\u2019 - so what were those motives ?"

      "author": "Elizabeth Tinnnemans",
      "text": "We found from all the people that we surveyed that only slightly more than half of them actually met up with someone. So it doesn't look like a lot of people are using it to meet up but it makes sense because we also looked at why they were using a dating app and the most popular and most common motives were using it out of curiosity and using it to pass time or entertainment. So they're not actively using these dating apps to meet people like swiping with friends is something that happens fairly often, especially among millennials."

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, she said that people used it out of curiosity . If you do something out of curiosity you're just interested in seeing what it is and what it does. Maybe you\u2019ve heard about something and although you don\u2019t want to actually try it, you do want to see what it\u2019s all about. For example, when I was travelling once, out of curiosity , I went to see people bungee jumping, but it was never something I was going to do myself."
