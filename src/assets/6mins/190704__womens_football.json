  "intro": [
    "As the FIFA Women's World Cup approaches the end of the tournament, we look at the rise in the popularity of female only football. We hear about the history of the women\u2019s sport in the UK and around the world and what progress has been made since the FA banned women\u2019s matches in 1921. You can learn some related vocabulary along the way too."

      "text": "OK. Well I will tell you the answer later in the programme. Now, Gemma Clarke is a writer on women\u2019s football in England and she spoke recently on the BBC Woman\u2019s Hour Programme. Here she describes the reaction throughout the years to women\u2019s football. Has it been easy for the women\u2019s game in England?"

    {
      "author": "Gemma Clarke",
      "text": "Women\u2019s football has really been a struggle to play, to have any kind of agency and to be taken seriously as athletes. That can be seen throughout history. I think every moment that women\u2019s football has had, you know there\u2019s been a kind of, a backlash afterwards or a kind of an attempt to keep women back and to dampen enthusiasm for the sport."

    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And she also mentioned that there was no agency in the women\u2019s game. To have agency means you have control over your own situation, you can make the decisions you want to make. So she\u2019s saying that the women\u2019s game didn\u2019t really have control over its own future."

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "That\u2019s right and she goes on to say that people tried to dampen enthusiasm for the sport. They tried to make it difficult for people to see and enjoy it. So who tried to dampen enthusiasm and how did they do it? Well, during and after the First World War, women\u2019s football became really popular with crowds of up to 50,000 watching games. It may have been popular with the crowds, but it wasn\u2019t so popular with the men who ran the game, the English Football Association. Here\u2019s Gemma Clarke again."

      "author": "Gemma Clarke",
      "text": "The men\u2019s football association were panicked by seeing women doing so well and they banned all women from playing football on association grounds and that lasted for about 50 years. It was a very concerted effort to keep women\u2019s football at amateur status and ensure that there weren\u2019t crowds watching them play."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "So the men were really worried by the success of the women\u2019s game. They thought that it might take money and supporters away from the men\u2019s game."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "So they banned woman from playing on their pitches. This means that they no longer allowed them to use the pitches anymore. This effectively killed the professional women\u2019s game as up to then they had been using the same facilities as the men."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "This she says was a concerted effort to restrict women\u2019s football. When you make a concerted effort to do something it means that you try really hard to do it. I\u2019m pleased to say that the ban on woman using Football Association pitches was eventually lifted, although only comparatively recently, in 1971. Right, before we review today\u2019s vocabulary, let\u2019s have the answer to today\u2019s question. So I asked you, Sam, when was the first official Women\u2019s World Cup? Was it\u2026"
