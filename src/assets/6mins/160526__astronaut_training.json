      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, I'd say claustrophobia \u2013 and that means: fear of being in a small space. That might be a problem because the space capsules are small and you're with the same people for months at a time."

      "author": "Alice",

      "text": "But zero gravity \u2013 a condition where gravity is exerting no force \u2013 can lead to wasting of the bones and muscles. Astronauts take two and a half hours of exercise per day to help prevent this."

      "text": "Major Tim Peake, British astronaut with the European Space Agency The way we practise spacewalk is in water. Water gives us the neutral buoyancy that we need. So we sink training modules into swimming pools and then practise the spacewalking on them. We wear very specific equipment, a pressurized spacesuit \u2013 very difficult to move in actually \u2013 it's hard to bend the fingers, it's hard to bend your arms \u2013 and it really gives you quite a difficult workout."

    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Yes. They take to the water and to the air too. Astronauts experience the feeling of weightlessness in planes. A large plane with padded walls flies to high altitude and then goes into a nosedive \u2013 or a fast and sudden fall \u2013 which creates short periods of weightlessness."

      "text": "But it's not all fun and games. Don't forget that one of the main reasons for being out on the International Space Station is to conduct research. Major Tim Peake is doing scientific experiments such as how to grow plants in space, and what effect radiation and zero gravity have on this process."

When you land in the Soyuz capsule sometimes you might not land exactly where you expect to be. Foraging for food, for example, and your basic elements of shelter and protection, getting water\u2026 Go and live in a cave for seven days with an international crew. And it's a wonderful environment to prepare you for a mission because you are very isolated."
