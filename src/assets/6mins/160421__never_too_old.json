I have a group of four other people who run with me in the mornings. We run about ten miles. Every day."

We have to be young at heart at least. And age is no reason for some people to stop working if they are in good health. Let's listen to Trisha Cusden who started a new business at 65 supplying beauty products for older women. Her age actually inspired her choice of work."
