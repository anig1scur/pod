If you hang onto something , you keep it. I've been hanging onto my phone for a couple of years \u2013 and am hoping I won't need to change it for another year or so, at least."

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Thanks for the advice, Rob. And our next word is 'cycle' \u2013 that's where one event leads to another, and then often repeats itself. For example, 'I'm in a bad cycle of going to bed late, then oversleeping in the morning.'"
