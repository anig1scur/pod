But one of the reasons for being flexitarian and only eating meat once in a while is for the benefit of the planet. According to a recent report, being flexitarian is healthier for the individual but can also help to fight climate change. Before we look in more detail at this topic, a question: Do you like peppers, Catherine?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "He described the need for ambitious technological improvements. Ambitious here means the developments will have to be 'impressive, above the ordinary and not simple'.

So the more plant-based you go, the healthier and the lower an environmental impact it probably will be."
