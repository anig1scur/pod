We'e very good at reading situations that we find ourselves in [\u2026] We're extremely good at picking up on signals. What we can then do is trigger the appropriate response. If it's an empathetic response we may well need to then be sympathetic, we maybe need to show our sort of fluffy side if you want. But on the flipside from an evolutionary point of view the reason we are so successful and we're still here is because we can, and when we need to, react aggressively to situations."
