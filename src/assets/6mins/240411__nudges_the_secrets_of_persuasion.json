So in this programme, we\u2019ll be asking whether the idea behind nudging - to influence human behaviour for good - is still true today. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

Another example of nudging happened in Woolwich, an area of London which in 2011 had a problem with anti-social behaviour, and particularly with shop windows being smashed. The local authority decided to use nudging to fix the problem by painting pictures on the shop windows, but what did they paint? Was it:"

Not even the most hard-hearted criminal smashed those windows, and anti-social behaviour fell by 18% in one year! OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme about nudging, ways of gently persuading or encouraging someone to take decisions."
