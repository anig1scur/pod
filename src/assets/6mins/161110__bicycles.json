    "Why do we love the bicycle? Cycling began its life as a leisure pursuit for middle-aged and wealthy men. Sophie and Neil discuss the bike's mass appeal, from helping to widen the human gene pool to blazing a trail for the women\u2019s movement."

      "text": "It was the first bike with pedals, called a \u2018velocipede' by its manufacturers. Others called it a 'boneshaker' because its tyres were made of iron so it was very uncomfortable to ride \u2013 especially over cobblestone streets."

And when they first rode bicycles they were expected to ride in long ankle length skirts and voluminous petticoats and of course that was entirely impractical so they adopted what was called rational dress. And rational dress was a better fitting jacket and pantaloon trousers which were cinched below the knee, which meant that nothing got caught in the chain. And at first there was massive public outrage. There were court cases about whether or not women were allowed to be served in pubs wearing this sort of dress."

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Sophie",

    },
    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "But pantaloons for women still caused outrage \u2013 or shock and anger \u2013 because although they were baggy, they were still trousers and they didn't go down to the ankle. So bikes played a part in women's struggle for emancipation \u2013 or freedom. But let's listen now to Robert Penn, who claims that it also played a role in our evolutionary history."

And so what started as a really faddish leisure pursuit, within a decade of 1885, the bicycle became the most popular form of transport on the planet, and it has been ever since."
