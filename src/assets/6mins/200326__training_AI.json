    "How clever is artificial intelligence? It currently helps us in many ways from car satnavs to detecting cancer cells but it's yet to be cleverer than us humans.  We still need to train AI to do things but should we fear that it eventually learns too much? Neil and Sam discuss the subject and teach some useful vocabulary."
