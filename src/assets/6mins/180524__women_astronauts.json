    "It\u2019s been 40 years since NASA first recruited women to be astronauts. Today, a third of the people who work at NASA are women. 2016 was the first year that there were an equal number of women and men joining as astronaut trainees. 6 Minute English discusses the future for women in space and asks if the first person to step on Mars could be a woman."

One person with those skills is Gioia Massa, a Life Science project manager for NASA. Now you would think that being a top scientist she would be brilliant at all areas or aspects of the job, but she told BBC News that it wasn\u2019t always the case.
