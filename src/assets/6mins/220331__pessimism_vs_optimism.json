Psychologists define optimism as an attitude which overestimates the chances of good things happening to you, while underestimating the chances of bad things occurring. So, what proportion of the British population, do you think, describe themselves as optimistic? Is it:"

      "text": "OK, Sam. We\u2019ll find out if your optimistic answer is the correct one later in the programme. Someone who probably wouldn\u2019t agree with you, th0ugh, is BBC World Service listener, Hannah. Hannah grew up in Germany before moving to the United States. She thinks Americans tend to be more optimistic than people back home in Germany, as she told BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience:"

I\u2019ve always admired how Americans tend to be able to sugarcoat everything."

      "author": "Sam",

This is surprising as it goes against the image we have of the grumpy old man \u2013 a phrase to describe someone who complains a lot, is moody and gets easily annoyed. Optimistic women, meanwhile, can look forward to longer, healthier lives."
