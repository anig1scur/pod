We\u2019ll be discussing conservations \u2013 the exchange of ideas, thoughts and feelings that happens when people talk to each other. And as usual we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."

But luckily, there are still millions of us who love to talk, chat, chinwag and chatter away. In fact, in 2012 a competition in Latvia broke the world record for the longest telephone conversation. So, Neil, my question is this: how long did this record-breaking conversation last? Was it: a) 24 hours and 4 minutes? b) 54 hours and 4 minutes? or, c) 84 hours and 4 minutes?"

      "text": "OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme. During a long career, DJ and BBC radio presenter, Nihal Arthanayake, has had conversations with hundreds of people. Now he\u2019s used these experiences to write a book entitled, \u2018Let's Talk: How to Have Better Conversations\u2019. Here Nihal tells another radio presenter, Michael Rosen, of BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Word of Mouth, about the influence of his mother who also loved talking to people in her job as a nurse:"

    {
      "author": "Nihal Arthanayake",
      "text": "Well, it gave me the sense that you are enriched by listening. And this was of course, pre-social media which has of course encouraged us to project - to transmit - more than receive. So it meant that I guess I was conscious of experiences of others, and wanted to try and understand them. Also, partially, Michael, it was a survival instinct because I was a little brown boy in a predominantly white school, a state school in the 1980s."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "For Nihal, good conversation involves listening as much as speaking. By listening we find out things about the person we are talking to which, in turn, help us understand ourselves. This is why Nihal says we are enriched by listening \u2013 we are improved by having something else added."

    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "As a British Asian boy growing up in a white community, Nihal also thinks conversation was a way for him to make friends and find protection. He says having conversations was a s urvival instinct - the human instinct to do something in a dangerous situation that will keep them safe from harm."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Nihal sees an important difference between \u2018listening simply to reply\u2019, and \u2018listening to understand\u2019. When we \u2018listen to reply\u2019, we are thinking about the next thing we want to say more than trying to understand the other person\u2019s point of view. \u2018Listening to understand\u2019, on the other hand, helps build bridges - improve relationships between people who are very different or do not like each other."

      "author": "Sam",
