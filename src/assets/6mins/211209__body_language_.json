If we don\u2019t hear someone speak on video, we ask them if they\u2019re on mute. Practise what I call the five-second rule \u2013 wait five seconds before speaking to make sure that individuals have time to process the ideas, especially if there may be technology or accessibility issues."

Number one, laughing is often done  where we can quickly pick up the energy of someone smiling or laughing and feed off of that and laugh ourselves. When it comes to screen delays, the fact that it\u2019s not natural to see our own camera \u2013 being distracted by that \u2013 we are much less likely to laugh and smile. One of the ways we can overcome this is by creating intentional moments in our meetings for the water cooler effect."
