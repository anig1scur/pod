What's going on in your day? How do you feel?\" So if you say, like \"I'm really, really stressed out\", Woebot might offer to help talk you through something."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, it could be unethical to deny a real patient access to a human therapist for the sake of a trial. Ethical basically means 'morally right'."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Despite these fears, digital therapy is booming \u2013 and Woebot is just one of an increasing number of electronic services. One reason for this could be using an app carries less stigma than maybe seeing a human therapist."

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And stigma refers to the negative associations that people have about something, especially when these associations are not fair. Even though mental health is now being talked about more openly than before, some people do still see mental health issues and therapy negatively."

You know, since we've had these little computers in our pockets with us everywhere we go, there aren't that many opportunities for real silence or self-reflection . You know, even a commute on the tube might have been a moment to just take a second to yourself, but now that void can be filled always with super-engaging content by looking at your phone."

      "text": "The answer was: one in four, according the World Health Organisation and the World Federation for Mental Health. But the WHO say that as many as two-thirds of people never seek help from a health professional \u2013 with stigma being one of the main reasons."
