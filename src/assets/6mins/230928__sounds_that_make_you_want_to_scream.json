Whether it\u2019s someone biting their nails, rustling a crisp bag, or scraping a knife on a dinner plate, some everyday sounds have the power to make us angry or upset."

For people suffering from misophonia, the specific sounds which cause them to become emotionally upset, also known as triggers , often involve food and eating. Just sitting down for dinner with their family can feel like torture."

You can't control it, and then it lingers and carries on for you, that immediate emotional response."

Passed away is a polite, euphemistic way of saying \u2018died\u2019. She also describes it as a shock to the system - a sudden and unpleasant change."
