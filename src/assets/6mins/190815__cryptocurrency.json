      "text": "The word is a combination of crypto, from cryptography , which is to do with using clever software codes to protect computer information and systems, and currency , which is the money of a particular country. So cryptocurrency , very simply, meanscode money. We usually think of money as notes and coins which come from a country\u2019s bank. But a cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t have physical money. It\u2019s purely digital and is not controlled by banks or governments but by the people who have it and very complex computer codes. Perhaps the most well-known is Bitcoin."

They are calling it 'Libra'. And we\u2019ll be finding a little bit more about this topic in the programme, but first, a question. Now, Sam, you mentioned Bitcoin as being a well-known cryptocurrency . It was, in fact, the first cryptocurrency , but when was Bitcoin created? Was it:"

    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Most currencies are reasonably stable . This is the opposite of volatile . They don\u2019t change a lot over a short period of time. There can be big changes but usually governments and banks control currencies to prevent it. Cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have those controls. What Jemima Kelly said was that they are subject to the whims of the crypto markets. A whim is an unpredictable or irrational decision or trend and if you are subject to the whims of something, or someone, it means that metaphorically you are a passenger in a self-driving car which may decide just to drive off the edge of a cliff. So it might be an exciting ride, but it could end in disaster."
