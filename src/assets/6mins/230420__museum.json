Anthropologist, Professor Adam Kuper, has written a new book, The Museum of Other People, which discusses the idea that many museum artefacts were stolen and should be given back. Here he speaks to BBC Radio 4 programme, Thinking Allowed, about two sides of the debate: one which saw European culture as superior, and another which didn\u2019t."

One is that all societies begin from a very rough base\u2026 We're all\u2026our ancestors were hunter-gatherers at one stage, and then they go through the stage of farming, industry\u2026 all this while they're getting smarter and smarter, their brains are getting bigger and bigger, and they\u2019re moving from primitive magic to sophisticated religion, then maybe on to science. So, it's onwards and upwards . And that's the imperial idea\u2026 and we're going to help these other poor benighted people up the ladder with us. And opposed to this there's this other 19 century ideology which says, \u2018no, this is an imperialist myth. We have our own culture. There are no better or worse cultures, there are just national cultures\u2019."

According to this view, white European culture was best because it was the most advanced, so it was their duty to help local cultures up the ladder , meaning to advance or make progress. Adam Kuper uses the phrase, onwards and upwards to describe a situation where things are improving, becoming better and better."

Firstly, since many of these treasures are hundreds of years old, to whom should they be returned? What\u2019s more, the history behind these objects is complicated. In the case of the Benin bronzes, for example, questions can be asked about the actions of local leaders, as well as the European powers."
