    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It is. And what\u2019s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs \u2013 one male and one female. They are singing duets together. So a duet is a song sung by two people \u2013 or in this case, sung by two gibbons!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time \u2013 which Dr Clarke describes as a cacophony . Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune."

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Gibbons also use different sounds to alert \u2013 or warn \u2013 other gibbons about danger from predators \u2013 these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call for an eagle."

    {
      "author": "Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University",
      "text": "Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language."
    },

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Right. And ancestor means an animal \u2013 or human \u2013 from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used context-specific calls like modern gibbons \u2013 then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for \u2018leopard\u2019 and another for \u2018eagle\u2019."
