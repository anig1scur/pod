I think there's something very comforting about eating good food and being with the people you're closest to and now I do the same with my own family. The kids are more likely to open up , talk more easily, about their day or something troubling them while we're eating."

We might think that's who we are. And then we go to another group and then we find, 'oh, I'm the wise one '. And I think if you feel like you're assigned a role in your family, I just think take that with a little bit of a pinch of salt."
