So Peter Parker had just, was sort of\u2026 one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to."

    {
      "author": "Alice",

These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse \u2013 or varied \u2013 readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities \u2013 who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home."

      "text": "Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it's one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority."

      "author": "Neil",

Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor's hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel."
