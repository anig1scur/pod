  "intro": [
    "When music bands tour, it comes at a cost to the environment. Huge amounts of carbon are generated when the musicians and fans travel the world to attend a gig. But now some bands are trying to develop a blueprint for performers and artists who want to continue what they do but reduce their environmental impact. In 6 Minute English we discuss some of the ideas and teach some useful related vocabulary."

We\u2019re going to look at all the energy being renewable and obviously the power we can create will go back to the grid , so we\u2019re hoping we can actually create legacy green infrastructure which can then power future gigs.
