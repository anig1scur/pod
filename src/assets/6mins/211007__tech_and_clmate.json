    "Smart technology is becoming more and more commonplace in people's homes, but coulld it help with the fight against climate change? With many people now trying to reduce their carbon footprint, is AI the answer? That's what Sam and Neil talk about, as they teach you related vocabulary."

This is where lots of sensors are attached to the wind turbine, so it can be modelled on a computer in real time .

And this is important because it means they can make sure they\u2019re performing their best."
