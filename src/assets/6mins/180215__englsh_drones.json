    "Drones have become commonplace in the skies above our heads. In certain cases they have been dangerous, but there are many new uses for them that are bringing us benefits too. From delivering parcels to saving lives, drones are taking off. Join our discussion about them and learn some new vocabulary in 6 Minute English."

And Dr Yoge Patel would agree. She is CEO of Blue Bear, which supplies unmanned planes and drones. Here she is speaking about drones on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme\u2026"

It's thought they were first used for providing practice targets for training military personnel. OK Neil, let's quickly go over some of the vocabulary we have mentioned today, starting with surveillance."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
