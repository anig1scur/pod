      "text": "Even if you take out some of these volatile items like food and energy, the sustained price increases we've had, it is actually getting passed through into how companies price their goods and services. and that's where it gets extremely worrying because that suggests that even if energy prices, food prices, come down, we could have inflation now in the system and I think that for advanced economies is worrying, for developing countries, that's hugely worrying."

      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So, she says what is most effective \u2013 meaning what works well and gets the best results \u2013 is slowing down demand. Increasing interest rates can do this because people will borrow less money. Interest rates are fees banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money."
