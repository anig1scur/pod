  "intro": [
    "Some people actively embrace risk by jumping out of aeroplanes, scuba-diving or motor-racing. But we all face risks every day by eating, drinking, walking and driving \u2013 simply going about our daily lives carries all sorts of unseen threats. And yet for some reason we don\u2019t judge these risks accurately. Follow Alice and Finn's discussion and learn new words."

Recently we have another increase in these birds' virus outbreaks in South Korea. People read about that. And they may pay a lot of attention to that in the news but they may forget to get their flu shot."

      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "That was Andreas Wilkey from Clarkson University. And we heard that a small probability of something happening means it's unlikely to happen. But we worry about big or catastrophic events such as catching bird flu or dying in a plane crash because we have a gut reaction to them\u2013 in other words, we react emotionally. A catastrophic event is something that causes a huge amount of damage and suffering."

    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "And it's often because of media coverage \u2013 for example, watching the news and reading the newspapers \u2013 that it can be difficult for us to understand how likely certain things are to happen. Catastrophic events feel like very real threats, while we tend to forget about the small but chronic risks that become more likely over time."

    {
      "author": "Finn",

Or hopefully even higher\u2026 You can't measure it on a scale or anything. For me, it's a stomach feeling. It's the value within me, and I'm the only one who can tell what value it has to me."

You are as likely to win the national lottery from a single ticket as you are to be knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey. This statistic comes from the Professor David Spiegelhalter, who is Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in the UK.
