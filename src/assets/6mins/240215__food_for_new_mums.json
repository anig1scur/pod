In this programme, we\u2019re talking about what women eat and drink in the first few weeks after having a baby. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

Giving birth is not called \u2018labour\u2019 for nothing \u2013 it\u2019s hard work, leaving the new mum physically and emotionally exhausted, and in need of food that\u2019s nourishing, for both herself and her baby. Here\u2019s Allison Oman Lawi, deputy director of nutrition to the United Nations World Food Programme, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Alison says that women need to eat even more calories postpartum, meaning after childbirth, than they do during pregnancy. That\u2019s especially true for mothers who are breastfeeding, feeding their baby directly with milk from her breasts."

    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "How new mums get those extra calories changes from place to place, and different cultures have developed their own traditions about what foods are best. For Chinese-American mum, Heng Ou, roast pig trotters were one of the best things to eat after childbirth because they contain a lot of collagen which helps produce breast milk."

Listen now as Ruma explains how important her mother\u2019s help was, to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"

      "author": "Ruma",
      "text": "So, the first 10 days were amazing. My mum came to stay and gosh! it was so important because I had a C-section so I was on very strong painkillers, I was in a daze anyway, and to be honest because she was here I was fed, you know, so she would look after me while I would look after baby. And my husband was very hands-on as well, so that first ten days whilst it was really hard, I didn't fall apart which I might have done if I'd been by myself."

      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "When Ruma talks about her mother\u2019s help, she uses the word, gosh!, an exclamation used to show a feeling of wonder or surprise. Ruma also says she was in a daze because of medicine she was taking for pain. If someone is in a daze , they feel confused and cannot think clearly, maybe because of a shock or surprise."

    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Along with her mother\u2019s healthy home cooking, the help Ruma got from her family meant she didn\u2019t fall apart , a phrase which means become so emotionally disturbed that you\u2019re unable to think or act calmly, or to deal with the situation you\u2019re in."

      "text": "Sure. I asked you when an unborn baby\u2019s stomach starts to grow. You guessed it was at five weeks, which was\u2026 the correct answer, Beth! At about 5 weeks, the cells forming a baby\u2019s stomach, lungs, bone and brain all start to divide and grow. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with postpartum meaning following childbirth."
