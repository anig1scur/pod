Both these words mean that shame is so strong that we really can\u2019t manage the emotion, we can\u2019t deal with it, we can\u2019t do anything to put it right. But she does say that a bit of shame can be positive because it effects change . This means that it causes change. If someone is shamed on social media, it\u2019s very public and can mean that they change their behaviour."

This is \u2013 aha \u2013 a reference to non-stick cookware! Teflon is the brand name of the chemical which was used to make pots and pans non-stick. The pans were coated or covered in this material. The reference to politicians is that there are some to whom criticism and shame just don\u2019t stick. They manage to avoid any negative consequences of their actions and this, she says, is scary."
