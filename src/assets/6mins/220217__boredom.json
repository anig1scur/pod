Having nothing to do, or doing the same task again and again, can certainly be demotivating.

      "text": "It's this emotion everyone thinks is so negative but there's a real positive to it too, there's a real upside to it. We become more creative, so for example, being bored allows our mind to wander, allows us to daydream, and that can actually lead us to problem solving and creativity. I fear that by swiping and scrolling our boredom away these days, that we're losing that creativity because we've got so much to entertain us - but it seems that the more we have to entertain us, the more bored we seem to be! And there's a reason for that \u2013 and that\u2019s because we actually get addicted to stimulation and to novelty ."

Let\u2019s take inspiration from Manoush Zomorodi \u2013 an author and host of the Zig Zag podcast. Here she is speaking on The Why Factor programme, explaining that it takes effort but it\u2019s worth it\u2026."

And I think that the issue is with mind-wandering, you don't immediately get to roses and chirping birds, and amazing creative thinking - there is this uncomfortable period that you have to pass through where maybe you start thinking about  things you don't want to  think about or uncomfortable situations or unpleasant feelings that you have, that's why boredom I think has negative connotations 'cos we feel uncomfortable - but when we stick with it that's when the good stuff can come."
