Learning happens so much more easily if you're relaxed and happy."

When you meditate you spend time quietly \u2013 focusing your mind - often for relaxation or spiritual purposes. Mindfulness is a particular a kind of meditation \u2013 when you try to empty your mind of thought. Does that make sense?"
