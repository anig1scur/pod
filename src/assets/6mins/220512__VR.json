In the safety of your own home, you put on a headset and are guided through a series of tasks moving you higher and higher off the ground. You start by taking an elevator to the top floor of tall building and move on harder challenges, like climbing a rope."

The art of successful therapy, and what you can do really, really well in VR, is enable someone to drop those defences , and in VR a person is more able to drop them because they know there\u2019s no real height there."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "But although it\u2019s simulated, the experience is real enough to trick your mind into acting in its habitual way \u2013 the way it usually, typically works. Although your brain knows you have both feet on the ground, VR is so realistic that to complete the tasks you have to drop your defences , a phrase meaning to relax and trust people by lowering the psychological barriers you have built to protect yourself."
