  "intro": [
    "Cities around the world are trying to clean up the air people breathe. One way of doing this is introducing low emission zones, which restrict or ban polluting cars. Last year, London introduced the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), and this year British cities including Bath, Leeds and Birmingham are also bringing in Clean Air Zones. 6 Minute English discusses this clean-air initiative and teaches some useful items of vocabulary."

So, just because the city meets a particular value, there is still an incentive to continue to improve air quality, because the health benefits continue to build up as you do that. So, targets are very good at focusing the mind , but they shouldn't be the only thing that we're considering."

      "author": "Neil",
