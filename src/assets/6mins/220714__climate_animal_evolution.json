  "intro": [
    "In the 1830s Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos islands in the Pacific Ocean. He studied the unique animals living on the islands. Darwin's trip led him to the theory of evolution. In today's episode, Sam and Rob discuss the impact of climate change on today's wildlife. Can animals evolve quickly enough to survive a changing climate? Join us to explore this topic and learn the useful vocabulary you need to talk about it!"

In the 1830s he visited the Galapagos, a string of islands in the Pacific Ocean famous because of the unique animals living there. Rob It was while in the Galapagos, observing small birds called finches, that Darwin started forming his theory of evolution . But today, the animals of the Galapagos face the same pressures as animals across the world because of the effects of man-made climate change."

He sampled, though, the finches from different islands, and so when he got back to England he was looking at all the variation in beak shape and size, and body size and shape, and he was recalling how certain finches were found on certain islands but not on other islands"

Finches born with a beak that could help them get more food were more likely to survive and have babies. Over time, as the birds passed on their successful genes, they adapted to fit in with their environment \u2013 what we know as evolution ."

But whereas we often think of evolution happening over hundreds, even thousands of years, the changes in the Caribbean lizards happened in around forty years, something that would have surprised Charles Darwin. Which reminds me of your question, Rob."
