Besides disappearing pens, workers have plenty of other complaints about office life, from co-workers who never do the washing up, to fighting over spaces in the car park. But according to a 2021 survey by the Metro newspaper, what did British workers vote the worst thing about working in an office? Was it ... a)    printers not working? b)    people speaking too loudly? or c)    co-workers leaving empty milk cartons in the fridge?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Nowadays most modern offices are open-plan, large spaces without internal walls dividing them up. The idea is to create a sense of togetherness, but many employees prefer having their own space, and use all types of objects to mark out their own personal territory. These could be anything from family photos and holiday souvenirs, to home-made cakes and biscuits placed at the end of a desk to allow people grab a biscuit and start a conversation."
