      "text": "An obvious answer would be that climate change is the result of carbon emissions caused by humans. It\u2019s about people\u2019s carbon footprint \u2013 the measurement of how much carbon dioxide is produced by someone\u2019s everyday activities."

      "text": "That makes sense. But recently some scientists, especially in the west, have been focusing on another issue: the increasing number of people in the world, something known as overpopulation. In this programme, we\u2019ll be discussing the controversial link between overpopulation and climate change. And as usual we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary, as well."

      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Since climate change is caused by human activities, it seems common sense that fewer people would mean lower carbon emissions. But in fact the connection isn\u2019t so simple. Not everyone emits carbon equally, and people in the western world produce far more than people in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia."

He\u2019s made the surprising calculation that an extra two billion people born in low-consuming countries, would actually add very little to global carbon emissions. Here, Kate Lamble and Neal Razzell, presenters of BBC World Service programme, The Climate Question, discuss Professor Ravikumar\u2019s findings."
