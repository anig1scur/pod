  "intro": [
    "Norwich was the first city in the UK to ban cars from parts of the city centre. Planners wanted to protect pedestrians from cars and to reduce pollution in its old and narrow streets. That was 50 years ago. There\u2019s a fresh interest in keeping cars out of cities now for the same reasons. Rob and Neil talk about pedestrianising streets and teach you new vocabulary."

      "text": "Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets In 1970 we had 20 million cars in this country. Now we have over 30 million cars in such a short period. So that creates three big problems. One is space \u2013 because we\u2019ve still got the same street structures in our towns and cities, causing congestion. It causes pollution, which people are concerned about more and more. And actually, it\u2019s kind of engineering walking out of our lives. So we\u2019re actually not getting enough exercise, which is a cause of a health crisis. Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation \u2013 in Glasgow, in Birmingham, in London for example, Manchester \u2013 as a way of not only making their places, cities better and more attractive, actually, building their local economy."
