      "text": "Making predictions for the future isn\u2019t easy \u2013 just ask tech billionaire, Elon Musk, who recently predicted that artificial intelligence will eventually mean that no one will have to work. In fact, there have been many predictions about the future of work, for example that robots will take over most jobs, and that everyone will work from home."

      "text": "During Covid, one of these predictions came true. Millions were forced to work from home. So what will work be like in the future? That\u2019s what we'll be discussing in this programme and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But first I have a question for you, Beth. Another idea for the future is the 'four-day working week' where employees work four days for the same money as five. After Covid, many British companies gave the idea a go, but out of the sixty companies taking part in a four-day working week trial in 2023, how many said they planned to continue with a shorter work week? Was it:"

      "text": "OK, Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, whatever Elon Musk thinks, as we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s difficult to make your predictions accurate. Here\u2019s Shaun Ley, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Real Story, asking University of Cambridge professor, Brendan Burchell, what he thinks about predictions for the future of work:"

      "author": "Shaun Ley",

      "author": "Prof Brendan Burchell",
      "text": "I do. I think we have to be sceptical. I think the track record for economists and other social scientists isn't good when we look\u2026 you know, for hundreds of years, a hundred years now, people have been predicting that they'll be really quite dramatic reductions in working time, like Elon Musk has just made, and previously those predictions - although we're heading very gradually in that direction - those predictions of very, very large changes in working time just haven't come to pass ."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Shaun asks if we should take predictions with a pinch of salt. To take something with a pinch of salt is an idiom meaning to doubt that what you've been told is accurate or likely to come true. For example, if your friend always lies, you take what they say with a pinch of salt ."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Professor Burchell thinks predictions for the future of work have a bad track record . A track record means all the achievements or failures that someone has had in the past. When it comes to predicting the future of work, most predictions simply haven\u2019t come to pass , an old-fashioned way of saying \u2018happened\u2019 or \u2018come true\u2019."

Some jobs, some professions are at risk. And, although economists like to say new jobs will crop up , they won't necessarily be aligned at the same time \u2013 there won't be coordination."

And that\u2019s exactly the problem \u2013 the future is hard to predict because it\u2019s so unexpected! Anyway, I reckon a shorter working week is something we can all agree on right, Neil?"

Actually, a whopping 92% of the companies plan on keeping a four-day week because it was so popular, with bosses as well as workers! Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with the idiom take it with a pinch of salt , meaning don\u2019t completely believe that what you are told is true."
