  "intro": [
    "You are used to having your vegetables coming from agricultural land, but how about space? Listen to the programme to find out how growing plants in space might help develop crops which are more productive and more resistant to climate change here on Earth. Neil and Georgina discuss how plants can grow in environments with little or no natural light and teach you some related vocabulary along the way."

    "a) potatoes",
    "b) lettuce",

      "text": "Basically we use LED lighting and we use LED lights that are tuned to a specific wavelength. So, if you image what the rainbow looks like, the reason a plant looks green is because it\u2019s not using all the green light \u2013 it actually reflects a lot of that back. So the reason why it looks pink in here is because we\u2019re actually only using red light and blue light to grow the plants, and that essentially tailors the light diet so that the plants look black when you look at them because they\u2019re not reflecting any light \u2013 they\u2019re being super-efficient, they\u2019re using up every photon that hits them."

They can adapt to so many different environments \u2013 we call this plasticity because they can turn on or off their genes to really adapt to all sorts of conditions and that\u2019s why you see plants growing in different areas on Earth - the same type of plant may look very different because it\u2019s adapting to the environment in that specific location."
