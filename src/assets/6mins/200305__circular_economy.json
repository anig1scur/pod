  "intro": [
    "The amount of waste we produce around the world is huge and it\u2019s a growing problem. Recycling has partly been the solution to the issue but it hasn't been enough. Now there are calls to develop a circular economy which makes manufacturers responsible for what happens to the goods they produce. We discuss this in 6 minutes and teach some new - not recycled - vocabulary!"

One reason is that it\u2019s not always possible to separate waste you can recycle from waste you can\u2019t recycle, and that makes treating it very difficult. Treating means handling it and using different processes, so it can be used again."

My rubbish and recycling is collected and I don\u2019t really think about what happens to it after that. Is as much of it recycled as I think, or is it just buried, burned or even sent to other countries? It\u2019s not in front of my house, so I don\u2019t really think about it \u2013 out of sight, out of mind."
