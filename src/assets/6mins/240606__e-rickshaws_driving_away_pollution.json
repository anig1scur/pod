      "text": "It\u2019s true that electric vehicles, or EVs as they\u2019re also called, are expensive, but in some parts of the world, the switch to electric vehicles has been a major success story in the fight against climate change. And it\u2019s not just rich people switching to electric - in India, poorer workers are embracing it too."

      "text": "Yes, In India it\u2019s the drivers of small vehicles like motorbikes, mopeds, scooters and rickshaws, known as two- and three-wheelers , who dominate the road, and now over half of these are electric. In this programme, we\u2019ll be discussing the growing role of electric vehicles in the fight against climate change. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

      "text": "OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. While electric vehicles score better than petrol or diesel cars in most environmental tests, there\u2019s some debate about exactly how green they are. A lot depends on how the electricity is generated in the first place, and in India more than three quarters of the electricity used continues to be generated by coal."

From an accessibility and affordability and efficiency point of view\u2026 and on that first point of accessiblity, the state of public transport is not as developed as it is in places like London or Singapore. There's no metro lines or fancy bus networks, and two- and three-wheelers spread in response to this lack of sufficient or high quality, frequent public transport infrastructure."

      "text": "In places without reliable public transport, electric scooters are filling the gap. That\u2019s really needed, because the massive increase of petrol cars in Delhi has created a toxic and very serious health risk \u2013 smog. Smog is air pollution caused by a mixture of smoke, chemicals and especially, car exhaust fumes. It makes the atmosphere difficult to breathe and very unhealthy."

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "What\u2019s more, because children are smaller and closer to car exhaust pipes, smog affects them most. In winter, the air in Delhi gets so bad they have to close the schools, sometimes for weeks. Here\u2019s Graihagh Jackson again, taking up the story for BBC World Service\u2019s, The Climate Question:"

      "author": "Graihagh Jackson",
      "text": "They're having to shut schools because the pollution is so bad! Gosh , that's hardly a solution is it! What can be done about it? Well, for India the solution partly lies in switching to electric scooters and e-rickshaws. By 2030 the government wants 30% of its vehicles on the road to be electric, and has put up $1.2 billion to make that happen."

      "text": "Luckily, the Indian government is taking measures to improve Delhi\u2019s air quality, largely through the switch to greener electric vehicles. The government has put up over 1 billion dollars to make this happen. The phrasal verb put up money for something means to provide the money needed to pay for it."

In fact, it\u2019s now China that tops the list, showing that when it comes to green transport, bigger isn\u2019t always better. Right, it\u2019s time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with two-wheeler , a vehicle with two wheels, such as a bicycle, motorbike or moped."
