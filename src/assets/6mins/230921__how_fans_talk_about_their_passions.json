Fandom is more than simply being a fan \u2013 it\u2019s a whole culture created by a community of people to share their love of the same thing."

In this programme, we\u2019ll be taking a trip into the world of fandoms, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some new and useful vocabulary too. But before that, I have a question for you, Neil. The original word \u2018fan\u2019 was first used about Americans in the early 20th century. But what were these Americans fans of? Was it:"

      "text": "Kings ruled their kingdoms, fans certainly rule their fandoms. It taps into that ancient human impulse to belong to a group of like-minded people, and of course being a fan by yourself can be a challenging thing because fannish pursuits can look quirky and odd\u2026 even obsessive, and you get often mocked and, I mean, if you're Jane Austen fan and you want to dress up in a bonnet and gown of the Regency era it's difficult to do that by yourself in public, but once you join a fandom there's no problem."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Fans are groups of like-minded people \u2013 they share similar opinions, ideas or interests. They do all kinds of weird and wonderful things together, such as dressing up as Harry Potter characters \u2013 behaviour which might be called quirky, an adjective meaning odd or unusual, but in an interesting way."

      "author": "Beth",

      "text": "Academics who study fandoms, they love to use acronyms and abbreviations and they've got several phrases which they used to describe the behaviour of football fans\u2026 BIRGing so that means \u2018Basking In Reflected Glory. When your team wins everyone wants a bit of the action , you take to the streets, dance around\u2026 and so the antithesis of that is CORFing which means \u2018Cutting Off Reflected Failure\u2019 and that is what people sometimes do when their team loses and they don't want to be associated with that loss, that sense of failure."

Fans say, \u201cWE won!\u201d, even though it was the players on the pitch, not the fans, who scored the goal. When their team wins, fans cheer and want a piece of the action , an idiom meaning that they take part in celebrations and other exciting group activities, and feel the success of the team as a personal success."

Actually, it was baseball fans, or \u2018fanatics\u2019 as they were called at the time. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with like-minded , an adjective describing people who share similar opinions, ideas or interests."
