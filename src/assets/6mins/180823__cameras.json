      "author": "Neil",

    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "That's right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control."

      "author": "Neil",

      "text": "I don't think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff , it's the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market's changing. And I don't think there'll be a time soon, yet, that\u2026 the smartphone will take over the camera completely."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Phil Hall",
      "text": "I think it's... some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that's a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what's the next rung up so it's people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit."

The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let's look at the vocabulary again."
