Increasingly, what we\u2019re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face-to-face interaction . In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively."

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy \u2013 more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction \u2013 as he says."
