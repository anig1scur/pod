Wild animals can endanger humans when they break into their farms for food or water. And people might be forced to attack or even kill these animals to defend their homes."

They are looking for where there is green pasture, so they come to this community where we have these nutritious foods\u2026 you know elephants love maize, beans, and that is the crop that farmers actually farm\u2026 so they come and eat those crops here, and also looking for water."

    {

Better yet, the bees also pollinate plants, and even produce honey. It\u2019s good news for the farmer, but I have to feel a little sorry for the elephants\u2026"
