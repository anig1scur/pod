    "Sharks have gained quite a reputation for being cruel and vengeful creatures. A lot of it might have to do with the 70s blockbuster movie 'Jaws'. But is this true? Do sharks kill more humans or do humans kill more sharks? Sam and Rob talk about it and teach you related vocabulary along the way."
