    "Bee numbers are declining at an alarming rate and in some places disappearing altogether, which has serious consequences for humans. Today, one third of the food we eat depends on insects to pollinate crops, fruit and vegetables. Busy bees Neil and Sam discuss what's being done to find a solution to the problem, and teach you vocabulary along the way."

      "text": "What is pollination ? All flowering plants need it to reproduce. Pollen is moved from the male part of a flower to the female part of a flower, then fertilisation can happen causing fruit to grow. Some staple crops such as wheat, rice and corn are pollinated by the wind however many plants don\u2019t release their pollen easily and this is where insects, and especially bees, come in. As they collect nectar to eat, pollen sticks to them and they carry it from flower to flower."
