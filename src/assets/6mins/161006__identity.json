There's some Caribbean in there, black Americans from the South and the Caribbean, and then on my mother's side there are people from the Caribbean, from Ireland but you know Irish American, German American. People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother's white skin - she's actually mixed but she's white from a distance, and I'm black from a distance."

And of course we're affected by the way other people see us. And that's one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity. I mean, I think it's kind of a two-way process that's ongoing. Our sense of who we are is always a response in part to how other people see us."

Alice Okey-dokey, fair enough. I asked you: What percentage of the UK population described themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it \u2026 a) 0.9%, b) 5.9% or c) 9%? Neil I said a) 0.9%."
