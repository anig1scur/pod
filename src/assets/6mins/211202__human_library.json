  "intro": [
    "We learn a lot from books and from talking to people. That's the idea behind an initiative to create a 'human library'. You borrow a person you wouldn\u2019t usually meet for a half-hour candid conversation and learn what it is like to be in their shoes. That's what Neil and Sam discuss, as they teach you related vocabulary."
