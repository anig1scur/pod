But there's something about dressing up as a knight that particularly appeals to people here in Poland. In the summer there's events every weekend and here in Malbork Northern Poland home to Europe's largest medieval castle there's one of the biggest of the season. There's archery, crossbow, jousting, other horse skills, and more than a hundred thousand people come to watch these tournaments."
