    "Every year, mosquito-borne diseases kill around three-quarters of a million globally. But could it get worse with climate change? With warming temperatures, mosquitos are now spreading to new areas, including Europe. We\u2019ll hear about dengue fever, one of the diseases they bring, and teach you related vocabulary."

But if they're accompanied by symptoms, for example red spots on the skin, or maybe there is a fever that lasts for three days, we can suspect that it\u2019s dengue fever. Day five to seven is the critical window for a dengue fever patient. Sometimes parents don't know about this critical window, and when they bring the child to the hospital, it's difficult for us to help."

But the news isn\u2019t all bad.  Fortunately, technology is getting better at slowing the spread, including early warning systems that can predict dengue outbreaks months in advance, and the ongoing work to produce a vaccine. All of which, hopefully, mean an end to dengue, and similar diseases\u2026 speaking of which, Beth, what was the answer to your question?"
