Often when we talk about money, it\u2019s emotions very close to us \u2013 there's guilt, there's shame. What have we done in the past? To start those conversations is complicated. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It\u2019s not just a simple case of talking about hard cash."

      "text": "Arabella Russell, relationship therapist Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently \u2013 there might be a spender there might be a saver. It\u2019s very tempting if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. They might do it differently because they see money differently. Do it differently but have a budget. Of course be honest about each other but recognise that you might just have a different view of money."
