  "intro": [
    "A football match! There's nothing like it, is there? The action, the drama, the atmosphere! Except that football fans don't seem to be singing as much as they used to and some managers are complaining it's having a negative effect on the players! So why is this happening? Follow Dan and Neil to find out and learn six related pieces of vocabulary."

It seems that for some football clubs, the atmosphere in the stadiums is becoming a bit \u2018quiet\u2019. Now, before we look at this topic in more detail, here is today\u2019s quiz. As we are talking about football, in which decade was the first ever international football played?"

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, we'll see if you're right or not later in the show. Now, songs and chants are part of the experience of football matches. But where do they come from? What are they about? Here\u2019s Joe Wilson from BBC Sport. Which team name does he mention?"

      "author": "Joe Wilson",

      "text": "So, which team does he mention?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, he used the syllables from United. This isn\u2019t one team as there are quite a few professional teams in Britain that have United in their names, in fact there are over a dozen. Perhaps the most well-known though would be Manchester United."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "I think fans of Welling United might argue with you about that! Anyway, what did Wilson say about the nature of football songs?"

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "When it comes to witty football songs Wilson describes them as being honed to be about a particular player, or a moment in a club\u2019s history. But these aren\u2019t the only kinds of songs. Another kind of song he describes is the hypnotic repetition of syllables."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Something that is hypnotic repeats again and again \u2013 like a magical spell or chant. What\u2019s interesting is that in football songs words can have more syllables than you would expect."

Some managers have complained that the fans are too quiet and that this has a negative effect on the players. So what are some of the reasons for this? Here\u2019s BBC Sport\u2019s Joe Wilson again. How many reasons does he mention?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Joe Wilson",

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "What Wilson says is that the members that make up a football crowd are changing. They are older and wealthier, and perhaps that is a demographic or group that is less likely to sing in public."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Another reason he gives is that sitting down might also discourage people from singing. If something discourages you, it makes you not want to do it. Most stadiums in the UK have to have seats and maybe singing is something that people feel happier doing when they are standing up."
