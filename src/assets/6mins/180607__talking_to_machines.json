  "intro": [
    "More and more people are talking to machines - more specifically, virtual assistants or bots. It's easy to do because you can often find them on your smartphone, computer or even a speaker in your house. Rob and Dan discuss how this is changing the way we interact with technology and the type of language we use."

We\u2019re going to hear now from Tom Hewitson, who is a conversation designer, working in the field of virtual assistants, talking on BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth programme. He talks about the whole idea of virtual assistants and how they are changing the way we interact with technology. How does he describe our existing relationship with computers?"

They\u2019re something you kind of use to get a specific thing done, whereas this is kind of changing them more into like an agent . They\u2019re an active participant in the interaction and in guiding you to make the right decision."

      "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right, we use them as a tool to get things done. But he says that modern technology is turning them into an agent . This doesn\u2019t mean a secret agent, like James Bond! In this sense an agent is something that has agency and that means it has the ability to act individually and make its own decisions."

      "author": "Dan",
