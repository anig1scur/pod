  "intro": [
    "'Mother tongue' is an interesting English expression. Like many languages, English has a number of gender-specific terms that don\u2019t refer to gender-specific ideas and concepts. And this complicated relationship between language and gender is what Sam and Georgina are talking about in this programme."

In a metaphor ,though, you don\u2019t say that something is like something else, you say that it \u2018 is\u2019 something else. For example, having good friends is the key to a happy life."

    {
      "author": "Sam",
