  "intro": [
    "From the bubonic plague and cholera to tuberculosis, pandemics have changed the ways cities have evolved. The coronavirus has been no different: with cities all over the world on lockdown, our cities have changed to become quieter and greener, with wildlife returning on an unprecedented scale. Rob and Neil discuss what this means for the future of our cities and teach you some useful vocabulary along the way."
