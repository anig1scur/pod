Is it:"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Libraries mean different things to different people, so who better to ask than someone who has written the book on it, literally. Professor Andrew Pettegree is the author of a new book, 'A Fragile History of the Library'. Here he explains what a library means to him to BBC Radio 3 programme, Art & Ideas:"
    },
    {
      "author": "Andrew Pettegree",
      "text": "Well, in my view, a library is any collection of books which is deliberately put together by its owner or patron. So, in the 15th century a library can be 30 manuscripts painfully put together during the course of a lifetime, or it can be two shelves of paperbacks in your home."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Today, books are available everywhere from supermarkets to train stations, but back in history that wasn\u2019t the case. In earlier centuries, printed books or manuscripts were rare and may have been painfully collected over many years. Andrew uses the adverb painfully , or painstakingly , to describe something which took a lot of care and effort to do."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "But paperback books and private collections are only part of the story. You may not believe it, but libraries are places of power! To find out why we have to go back in time to the ancient Egyptian port of Alexandria in the third century BCE."

      "text": "The Great Library of Alexandria held the largest collection of books in the ancient world. Founded in the city built by Alexander the Great, the library\u2019s mission was to bring together a copy of every book then in existence. According to history professor, Islam Issa, there were two reasons why the Great Library made Alexandria so powerful, as he explained to BBC Radio 3 programme, Art & Ideas:"

    {
      "author": "Islam Issa",
      "text": "The first is being in a location at the intersection of the continents and bringing a diverse set of people together to live in harmony , or relative harmony, can bring about economic prosperity. And the second is, quite simply, that knowledge equals power , and so the library is a form of soft power, it's a way of saying that Alexandria is an important centre of knowledge, a regional capital by being the guardians of knowledge\u2026"

      "author": "Beth",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But the main reason for the Great Library\u2019s importance is that knowledge equals power , a saying meaning that the more someone knows, the more they will be able to control events. Alexandria became the capital of soft power , the use of political and cultural knowledge, rather than military power, to influence events."
