So, once you clip it on to any white cane it works perfectly to detect the obstacles in front of you, and it relies on echo-location . So, echo-location is the same technology used by bats and dolphins to detect prey and obstacles and all that. You send out a sound pulse and then once it bounces off an obstacle, you can tell how far the obstacle is."
