  "intro": [
    "Conspiracy theories are not a new phenomenon - some people still don't believe that man has ever been to the Moon. But with the coronavirus pandemic has come a huge wave of novel online misinformation, including some outlandish ideas, and some panicky people are buying into them. Neil and Sam discuss what to do when you are confronted with someone who spreads falsehoods. And they teach you vocabulary along the way."

It looks like reading online conspiracies has sent Neil down the rabbit hole \u2013 an expression used to describe a situation which seems interesting and uncomplicated at first but ends up becoming strange, confusing and hard to escape from.

Some of the claims are bonkers \u2013 that he wants to use the virus as a pretext to microchip everyone in the world. Others say a vaccine would actually kill people rather than save their lives. These ideas are without any evidence. We should treat them with the disdain they deserve."

Approach them on their own terms and avoid sweeping dismissals or saying, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong!\u201d. Try not to judge. And try to get to the bottom of the often legitimate concern at the heart of the conspiracy. Present them with facts and research. Try to do this neutrally. You can\u2019t force anyone to change their mind but you can make sure they have valid information."
