    "No more 'coffee girl'! Many women are tired of being given unimportant tasks as they see their male colleagues go up the corporate career ladder. Hear about the women questioning the kinds of jobs expected from them. Sam and Neil talk about gender and the workplace and teach you related vocabulary along the way."

In many workplaces around the world, it\u2019s the men who are considered \u2018born leaders\u2019 and promoted up the corporate career ladder, while the women are given less important roles. Even today, many working women find themselves at a point in their career beyond which they cannot progress, an invisible barrier to succeed referred to as the glass ceiling."

Their dissatisfaction with their work is much greater. And we\u2019ve been trying to sort of address all these objectives with lots of different methods and techniques, and what is interesting about the non-promotable work is that it, in a very structural sense, contributes to all of those differences."

Note-taking is one of them, in meetings, when you, kind of, are told that you can\u2019t really speak or say anything. I was tasked with being the team party organiser, so that was my role. It does definitely occur that the women in the team, the level of multitasking they\u2019re doing just ... far outstrips the men in a lot of cases, for example, you know, a lot of women in the team would also be juggling having kids at home, being a working mum."
