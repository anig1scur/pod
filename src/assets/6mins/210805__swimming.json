    "Swimming has many health benefits and since ancient times has been used to promote strength and wellbeing. But swimming\u2019s not just about exercise \u2013 there\u2019s far more to it beneath the surface as we\u2019ll be finding out in this programme on the history of swimming. Neil and Georgina talk about the topic and teach you related vocabulary along the way."
