  "intro": [
    "The everyday lift \u2013 or elevator \u2013 is a very useful invention with a fascinating history. But it has led to some modern day irritations for people who use them. Rob and Neil discuss awkwardness in lifts and what can be done to overcome it. There'll also be teaching some related vocabulary and phrases."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, I suppose before the days of lifts rich people lived on the ground floor and poorer people lived on the top floors and had to use the stairs. Now though it's the other way round \u2013 and that, in turn, has given rise to penthouses with their fantastic views."

In the Middle Ages there were examples of lifts being used for military purposes. Then they helped to move agricultural products around. They really came into their own \u2013 or became very useful - in the Industrial Revolution."

      "text": "Yes, it's a strange one, isn't it? Well, let's listen to Jason Whale, sales manager at Elevators Ltd, talking about this subject. He thinks he may have found a solution to the problem. He uses a word that describes the state of feeling strange or uneasy. Can you tell me what it is?"

If you have things around you, you take away that awkwardness . We all look at our phones sometimes or look down at the floor. Well, surely it's better to look at advertisements on the walls\u2026"

      "text": "It's a good idea if the lift doesn't break down! Let's get back to the thought that digital advertising can make travelling by lift a more pleasant experience.  Let's hear from Jason Whale again. He uses a word that means \"thinner\". Can you spot it?"

      "author": "Jason Whale, sales manager at Elevators Ltd",
      "text": "I think, with all things, as technology becomes both slimmer and also cheaper as well, it becomes much more attractive to people who purchase lifts and therefore there are so many different ways to enhance a lift with light boxes, with moving images, with television screens, it becomes quite exciting for us, and hopefully a little bit more interesting for the people who use lifts every day."
