      "text": "The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment . Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady."

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It\u2019s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn\u2019t really belong, that she didn\u2019t have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn\u2019t deserve her position."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn\u2019t justified. It\u2019s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us."

    {
      "author": "Dan",

      "text": "That\u2019s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Dan",

You were right in that it was later than the 18th Century, which was when the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn\u2019t as late as the 20th Century. It was the second half of the 19th Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let\u2019s review today\u2019s vocabulary."
