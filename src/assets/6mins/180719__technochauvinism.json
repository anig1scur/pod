    "Human beings are flawed and carry their prejudices and opinions with them. Wouldn't it be better if we could replace them with artificial intelligence, if we could get computers to do all our thinking for us? Rob and Catherine discuss if technology is a good solution for all our problems and teach you six items of vocabulary."
