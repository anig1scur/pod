    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. People have been drinking tea for centuries, but that doesn\u2019t mean tea drinking hasn\u2019t changed over the years. Here in Britain, new trends such as iced tea and green matcha tea have become as popular as the traditional English cuppa which, as everyone knows, is black tea with a splash of milk."

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Pearl milk tea, or bubble tea as it\u2019s often called, was invented in 1987 by Taiwanese tea shop owner, Liu Han-Chieh. The \u2018bubbles\u2019 in a glass of bubble tea are made from balls of a chewy starch called tapioca. Food which is chewy needs to be chewed a lot before it becomes soft enough to swallow."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "It\u2019s these tapioca balls which give bubble tea its name. You might say they\u2019re bubble tea\u2019s signature ingredient \u2013 they\u2019re a special feature for which something is particularly known. For example, paella is the signature dish of Spain."
    },
    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "What\u2019s more, because tapioca doesn\u2019t have a strong taste, different flavours can be added, making bubble tea an innovative, meaning new and original, drink. Liu Han-Chieh\u2019s invention was inspired by a trip to Japan where he saw people enjoying iced milk tea on a hot summer day. When he added tapioca balls, which he found in a local market on his return to Taiwan, the bubbly new beverage was born."

      "text": "Right. I asked you what percent of Brits still regularly prefer drinking tea over coffee and you said 49 percent, which was\u2026 the wrong answer I\u2019m afraid, Neil. In fact, around 59 percent of Brits still regularly drink tea. Maybe it\u2019s time for a bubble tea revolution over here! OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with cuppa , an informal word in British English for a cup of tea."
