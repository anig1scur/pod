Berrill, forensic psychologist in New York City The thing that was most troubling is that because she realized that she was not an attorney and that she was taking people's money under false pretence, there was no sense of remorse or sense of sadness that she had exploited the people that trusted her. But, you know, in cases where you get these impostors who specifically are pursuing financial gain, they know what they're doing, but they do it with the shallow conscience of an antisocial personality."

They often name themselves based on the original band's name (sometimes with a pun), or on one of their songs or albums. For example, Bjorn Again \u2013 a famous Abba tribute band. This name is a pun on 'Bjorn', a member of Abba, and the phrase 'Born Again', which means to come back to life! Alice OK. It's time to hear the words we learned today. They are: impersonation cheesy imitate catchphrase gags tic impostors conscience shallow antisocial Neil Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!
