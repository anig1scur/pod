In recent years, Halloween has become more influenced by American horror movies like \u2018Friday the Thirteenth\u2019 or \u2018Scream\u2019. Some parents now think Halloween costumes are too scary and over the top \u2013 a phrase meaning too extreme and unsuitable. Mother of two, Joanne O\u2019Connell, was shocked when she took her 10- year-old daughters shopping for Halloween costumes. Here she explains what she saw to BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours"

They've seen what's described as a standing animated decoration which looks like a dead girl carrying a knife and various Grim Reapers , creepy clowns, and stuff that kids are now finding frightening, and even to an adult, they look pretty vile, actually. And I think it feels like retailers are in some kind of race to the bottom for the grimmest, most vile, sickening outfit so that they can just make money out of."
