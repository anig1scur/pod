    "In this programme we discuss risk and how different people react to different levels of risk in different ways. We hear from an expert who describes the different types of risk takers and how knowing your risk type can help people such as financial advisors, make decisions for you."

      "text": "OK, well we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme. Joe Kable is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. In a recent BBC science programme, All in the Mind, he talked about the psychology of risk and whether there was anything physically in our brains that could predict how much risk we are prepared to accept. Here he is, first talking about a number of different ways people see risk. How many different types does he describe?"

      "author": "Joe Kable,",
      "text": "Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania Some people are quite risk-averse and really don't want to take any decisions where there's risk involved at all, whereas others are fairly risk-tolerant and in some cases even risk-seeking so they seek out decisions that have an aspect of risk to them."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "How many different types of people did he mention, when it comes to attitudes to risk?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, there were three. The first group was those who are risk-averse . If you are averse to something, you are against it, you don't like it. So risk-averse people don't like to take risks."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The second group are those who are risk-tolerant .If you are tolerant of something, you accept it, you don't mind it, it's not a problem for you. So someone who is risk-tolerant is not worried by an element of risk in what they choose to do."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "The third group he mentioned are those who are risk-seeking . If you seek something, you actively look for it, you try to find it. So risk seekers are those who enjoy risk and want to take risks in their life."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So it seems as if this is something that could be measured. You could put someone in a brain scanner and tell if they like risk or not. I wonder how useful that would be though \u2013 is there any practical application for this knowledge?"

      "author": "Joe Kable",
      "text": "Definitely something that I can see coming out of this is using these associations to help develop better assessments of who's likely to take risks versus not. This is exactly the thing that financial advisors want to assess when you come to them and say 'I want to put my money away for retirement' . Exactly the aspect of your personality that they want to know is what's your tolerance for taking risk?"

It would help them to assess what to do with your money, which means it would help them to decide, to make an intelligent decision about your money in certain situations."

You know I think my financial planner could just ask me about how I feel about risk rather than giving me a brain scan. I heard brain scans can be risky!"
