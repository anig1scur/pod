It\u2018s about the relationship between the amount of energy coming in \u2013 in other words, the food we eat - and the amount of the energy going out \u2013 the usual movements and activities of day-to-day life.

We walk on two very straight legs, if a human stands next to a dog, for example, the dog has got that funny bent classic dog leg shape, right? And that crouched posture is really typical of most animals. Humans have a very straight leg, and so because of that, and because our legs are pretty long for our body size \u2013 humans are part of the ape family \u2013 we\u2019re are efficient."

      "author": "Roy",
      "text": "Humans are apes and evolved from the same origin as gorillas and chimpanzees. One big difference however is that humans walk upright on straight legs, whereas most animals are crouched \u2013 bent over at the knee and leaning forwards to the ground. This crouched posture is not an efficient way to move."

      "text": "So, the design of the human body makes it efficient compared to some other animals - but how do humans compare with each other? How do Kenyan athletes break long-distance running records, while many of us struggle to run for the bus? The main reason, according to Loughborough University physiologist, Rhona Pearce, is training. But there may be other factors too, as she explained to BBC World Service\u2019s, CrowdScience."

      "text": "Age probably comes into it in that there\u2019s probably an optimal age for tendon elasticity \u2013 that drops off as you get older, so probably there\u2019s a sweet spot in age for running economy. So, in terms of weight, it depends what you weight is made up of, if you\u2019ve got more muscle mass that\u2019s going to help you, whereas if it\u2019s more fat then you\u2019ve got to carry it."

      "author": "Roy",
      "text": "Body composition also plays a part. Efficient runners need high muscle mass - the amount of muscle in your body, as opposed to fat or bone. So, training, age, muscle mass and genetics and are all factors which, when they come together, produce a sweet spot \u2013 the best possible combination of factors and circumstances. And from the evidence it looks like my answer to your question was right, Sam."
