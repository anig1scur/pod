      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "Poor Neil! You do sound really down in the dumps , and that means unhappy! Well, the subject of today's show is loneliness. And loneliness is sometimes described as a social pain \u2013 a pain that tells us that we're isolated \u2013 or lacking contact with others \u2013 which motivates us to seek out companionship."

      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "OK, we'll see if you got that right later on in the show. So, getting back to loneliness \u2013 the idea is that because it makes us feel bad, it motivates us to go out and meet people. Some people are more likely to feel lonely than others because our genes play a role in this tendency."

      "text": "I don't know, Neil, but while in some situations being lonely may be a good thing, because it encourages you to be sociable, in other situations it may be useful to tolerate \u2013 or put up with \u2013 loneliness. Let's listen to Professor Dorret Boomsma at the Vrije University in Amsterdam talking about this."

      "text": "Professor Dorret Boomsma, Department of Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam So the intriguing question is why do genes that influence loneliness still exist? And one explanation is that probably they do not only have negative effects. In some situations it is an advantage to be able to tolerate high levels of loneliness and that is why the genes are maintained in the population."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "That's true. And actually, that was despite spending a long time on Facebook, and that's a form of social contact. But does all the tweeting, messaging, and chatting online that we do make us lonelier, because we're getting out less and meeting fewer people? Or do virtual connections stop us from feeling lonely?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "Those are also intriguing questions. Let's listen to Professor Eric Klinenberg sociologist at New York University and author of a book about living alone. He talks about this."

    {
      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Eric Klinenberg, sociologist at New York University and author We just don't have great research showing that we are significantly more lonely or isolated today than we were ten or twenty or thirty years ago, which means critics who say that Facebook or the internet or whatever device you carry with you, is making you lonelier and more miserable - they just don't have that much evidence to back it up."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So there isn't enough evidence to back up \u2013 or support \u2013 the claim that social media is making us feel lonelier."

    },
    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "Yes. There are environmental factors involved in loneliness too. For example, if somebody you talk to every day is always unfriendly towards you, this makes you statistically more likely to be negative in your interactions with somebody else."

      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "This is the wrong answer, I'm afraid. It's actually c) Sweden. Nearly half of all Swedish households are single-occupancy \u2013 or for one person. Living alone in Sweden is arguably the norm because it's so easy \u2013 there are many affordable single-occupancy apartments and young Swedes can expect to move into their own apartment once they graduate high-school."
