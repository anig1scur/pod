      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It's a good question. And it depends on which layer you're talking about! The crust and mantle are rock and contain a lot of silicate \u2013 which is the same stuff that glass is made of. But the outer and inner parts of the core mainly consist of iron."

      "text": "And so over time, the planet has started to cool. And as it cools, eventually at the centre of the Earth, the highest pressure point, we pass over the crystallization temperature \u2013 the freezing temperature of iron \u2013 and iron starts to freeze at the centre of the Earth. And you get a crystal of iron right in the middle that starts to grow."

      "text": "Don't worry, Alice! In this case, because of the incredibly high pressure in the core, the freezing point of iron is actually about 6000 degrees! And the iron has been cooling down and crystallizing for a billion years \u2013 and at a rate of just half a millimetre every year."

      "text": "Certainly. Now moving on, we should also talk about the fact that it's the liquid iron outer core that generates magnetic fields \u2013 and it's thanks to these magnetic fields that life on Earth is possible. Let's hear more about this."

Deuss : It just creates a shield, which will just deflect the cosmic rays from the Sun to actually reach us at the surface. So it protects us. Bragg : So it goes up there\u2026 Deuss : Yeah, so you would see that the radiation kind of goes right into the Earth and not actually reach us."
