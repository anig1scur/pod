    "From artificial lights, to late night TV, and now the ever-present glow of our smartphones, modern life is often blamed for ruining our sleep. But do we really need so much sleep? Neil and Alice discuss a new study by American researchers which has concluded that our ancestors were probably as sleep deprived as we are."

If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported. They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more."

But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep. Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia."

What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals \u2013 the the the the the the the the the \u2013 what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals \u2013 irregular in this context means not spaced out evenly. Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep. It sounds like a very simple solution. I wonder if it works?"
