    "Some companies offer students or recent graduates what they call internships . These are extended periods of work experience where someone can be working full-time without an actual contract and, in many cases, without even being paid. But does this mean some people on lower incomes can't afford to take up the opportunities it offers? We discuss the pros and cons of working for free."
