A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs \u2013 and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they make good, sound business sense . Whereas a superyacht is essentially a black hole ."

Now that's another great term \u2013 conspicuous means 'visible or noticeable' and consumption means 'spending'.
