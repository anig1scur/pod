It's said that your personality is reflected in your pet \u2013 an animal that you keep in your home as a companion and treat kindly. \u2018Dog people\u2019 are supposed to be friendly, enthusiastic and loyal, whereas \u2018cat people\u2019 are introverted, proud and sensitive. Are you a \u2018dog person\u2019 or a \u2018cat person\u2019, Neil?"

In the UK, 52% of owners describe their pet as their \u201cbest friend\u201d, and in 2021, 18 million homes had at least one pet, meaning that for the first time there were more households with a pet than without."

But first I have a question for you, Georgie. Nowadays thanks to the internet, modern pets are getting online. So what percent of dogs and cats in the UK do you think have their own social media profile? Is it: a) 7%? b) 17%? or c) 70%?"

      "text": "OK, Georgie, we'll find out the answer later in the programme. Cats using Instagram and dogs on TikTok may be a strange new development, but our relationship with pets has continually changed throughout history. In the 1800s, people started using the word \u2018pet\u2019 to describe the emotional connection they felt to a special animal, and gradually it became normal to keep pets indoors."

      "text": "First of all, on a very practical level, living standards are gradually increasing across that period, and it becomes more possible to keep pets if you have more disposable income. But I think in British culture, in the 19th century in particular, home and family are increasingly celebrated, and keeping a pet becomes a way of bringing animals into your home life, and also really expressing what it means to be part of the family - animals become part of that."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Family pets became more popular as people\u2019s living standards increased. Living standards, which are also known as \u2018the standard of living\u2019, refer to the level of material comfort people live in. It\u2019s connected to their disposable income, the money left over to spend on things you want, after paying tax and other living expenses. In other words, as people got richer, they had more money to spend on luxury items, including pets."
