If you\u2019ve seen nature documentaries about worker bees flying from flower to flower, you probably think animals are always on the move.

And if it\u2019s good enough for animals, would being lazy work for humans too?

Of course, some animals have a reputation for lounging about \u2013 lions, for example, can sleep up to twenty hours a day! But what is the slowest moving animal on Earth? Is it: a)    the giant tortoise b)    the three-toed sloth or c)    the koala?"

      "text": "OK, Neil. I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme. Now it\u2019s no surprise that lazy lions love relaxing, but even animals with reputations for being busy spend time doing nothing. Look carefully into an ant's nest and you\u2019ll see around half of them just sitting there motionless. Here\u2019s Professor Dan Charbonneau, an expert in insect behaviour, discussing the lazy rock ant with Emily Knight, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Naturebang."

      "text": "Then why are so many of them inactive? One possible answer is that they\u2019re reserve ants, ready to step in if disease or disaster strike. But could it simply be that they don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t need to. Would you get out of bed on Monday morning if you didn\u2019t have to?"

Boredom is the mother of invention, an idea based on the famous proverb, necessity is the mother of invention , an idiom meaning that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it."
