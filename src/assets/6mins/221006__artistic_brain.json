We\u2019ll hear two expert opinions, and as usual, we\u2019ll learn some useful new vocabulary as well. So, what do you think, Neil? Are artists\u2019 brains different from other people\u2019s?"

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "I\u2019m not sure, Sam, but it\u2019s true that many artists behave differently, often in very strange ways. For example, did you know that Michelangelo worked so hard he never took a bath! Or that guitar legend, Jimi Hendrix, once set fire to his guitar on stage!"

    {
      "author": "child prodigy",
      "text": "We\u2019ll hear more about the artist\u2019s brain soon, but first I have a question for you. As you said, artistic ability comes naturally to some people, including the famous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart was considered a  - a young child with very great musical talent. So, how old was Mozart when he composed his first piece of music? Was he: a) five years old? b) ten years old? or, c) fifteen years old?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. If artists\u2019 brains are different, it could mean they see the world in unusual ways. Dr Rebecca Chamberlain is a researcher in the neuroscience of art. She investigates how artists see the objects they are drawing by measuring saccades \u2013 the rapid movements our eyes make as they jump from one thing to another. Here she shares her findings with BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rebecca Chamberlain",
      "text": "Artists seem to be processing the visual world in a different way to non-artists, particularly when they\u2019re drawing. The artist actually takes a more global approach to looking \u2013 so they make bigger saccades, bigger eye movements, and shorter fixations on the image. So, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re getting much more of a kind of gist level view of the thing they\u2019re looking at."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Rebecca\u2019s experiments seem to confirm that artists\u2019 brains work differently because of their processing of the visual world \u2013 the way their brains make sense of information. Interestingly, processing also means the act of developing pictures from photographic film."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "When they draw, artists make bigger, quicker eye movements so they are able to see the whole picture, something also known as the gist \u2013 the overall, general impression of something without focussing on the details. If you \u2018get the gist\u2019 of what someone is saying, you understand the overall meaning of what they say, but not the details."

      "text": "The second expert to answer our question about the artistic brain is Mike, a BBC World Service listener from Malawi. Mike is a self-taught painter who creates large, colourful pictures in his studio. According to him, artistic ability isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with - it can be learned, as he explained to BBC World Service\u2019s, CrowdScience."

So, I gave him some tips, and in a month, he was really good \u2013 he was like really surprised, blown away , he never expected it. So, there are some things that are trainable , it\u2019s like a bike. In my case, I learned how to do those things without anyone telling me, you know like, if you are drawing the face, the human face, the distance between your eyes is the same as one of your eyes."

Still, some scientists think there may be third possibility: everyone\u2019s brain works by focussing on some areas and ignoring others, making a kind of jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. Maybe all of us \u2013 you, me, Mozart and Jimi Hendrix - are just filling in the missing pieces our own way."
