Because ultimately that's why people come see you."

You look great for 63.' You never hear that when you're young. You never hear: 'You look good for 19.' You think there's going to be some magic potion \u2013 some magic shortcut to it all. It's writing and getting up on stage. It takes a lot of perseverance and it's such a competitive occupation. You know, you've just got to outwork everybody."
