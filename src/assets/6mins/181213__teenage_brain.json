  "intro": [
    "Until recently, it was thought that human brain development was all over by early childhood but research in the last decade has shown that the adolescent brain is still changing into early adulthood. This programme delves inside the teenage brain, hears from an expert and teaches some useful vocabulary along the way to stretch your own brain!"

      "text": "I'll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?"

      "author": "Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore",
      "text": "The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Surprisingly, it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "No, that\u2019s right. She talked about the period of adolescence . This noun, adolescence , is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years."

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex . Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don\u2019t get their homework done in time?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore",
      "text": "The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it\u2019s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet."
