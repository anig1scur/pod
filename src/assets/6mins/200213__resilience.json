      "text": "First of all, there's our social supports, our communities, our families, the people who are important to us, the organisations we work for, so one way we can look at resilience is to measure that \u2013 the amount of social support available to us. Another way to think about resilience is to think about how we think about the situations we are in. So, for example, one way to look at that would be just to look at how optimistic people are as a guide to how resilient they might be when times get tough. And then a third level that we can look at for resilience is a biological level - how well we can soothe ourselves, calm ourselves down, how well we can actually regulate our own nervous systems at times of distress ."

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Right, so Dr Westley describes social supports \u2013 the people around us who we can talk to and support us and generally make us feel better. I think he\u2019s saying, with more support we feel more resilient."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It\u2019s interesting to note that a resilient person isn\u2019t necessarily someone quiet, who doesn\u2019t make a fuss and gets on with things. Some experts think it\u2019s people who ask for help and use this social support network who are acting in a more resilient way."
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "It\u2019s a good point. And another level of resilience is how optimistic someone is. Being optimistic means having positive thoughts about the future and believing things will turn out well. A positive mind means you can deal with situations that, at first, look tough. Another level Dr Westley mentioned was our biological level - how our bodies cope in times of distress . Distress is the feeling you get when you are worried or upset by something."

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Well, one thing Ann went on to say was that families and friends can be a great support and help with resilience. Those that were \u2018late bloomers\u2019 only connected with adults and mentors later in life."

And children are watching; they're learning from the adults around them by seeing how they react when they get challenged by something. Time now to find out how resilient you are when you discover the correct answer to the question I asked earlier. I said that \u2018resilience\u2019 is also a word used in science to describe the characteristic of a substance or object. But what does it mean? Is it... a) It is very tough or hard. b) It can return to its original shape after being bent. c) It can turn from a solid into a liquid quickly. And what did you say, Georgina?"
