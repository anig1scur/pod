  "intro": [
    "Free diving is a sport where people dive underwater as deep as they can without carrying air tanks, so just by holding their breath. We hear about Herbert Nitsch who holds the world record for the deepest free dive and find out how and why he does it - plus we'll teach some useful vocabulary along the way."

      "text": "That\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to find out today about a world record free diver. But first a question \u2013 and this is a physics one. On dry land, at sea level, the pressure or weight of all the air above us is known as an atmosphere. How far underwater do you have to go until the weight of water is equal in pressure to another atmosphere? Is it:"

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Well, water is much heavier than air, but there is lot of air above us, many kilometres, so I don\u2019t think one metre of water is heavy enough. Same for 10 metres. So, I think 100 metres is the equivalent of 1 atmosphere."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK. We\u2019ll find out if you are swimming comfortably or completely out of your depth later. Herbert Nitsch holds the world record for the deepest free dive. In 2012 he reached a depth of 253 metres. Recently he spoke on the BBC World Service radio programme, Outlook about his experiences. He spoke about how he trained himself to hold his breath for a long time. Lungs are the organs in the body that hold the air that we breathe in, and he says that he trains himself not by starting with a big breath, but when his lungs are already empty. Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Herbert Nitsch",
      "text": "The reason why I do the empty lungs is that the urge to breathe comes earlier and this is when the training starts. Because when you hold your breath on full lungs, the urge to breathe comes like a few minutes in, but the time up to that point is no training at all. Only the time you have the urge to breathe and fight against it, that\u2019s the time you\u2019re actually training."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, why train with empty lungs ?"

    {
      "author": "Georgina",

      "text": "Can you explain further?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Of course. Normally our breathing is automatic. We don\u2019t have to think about it. If you hold your breath there is a point when your body tells you that it\u2019s time to breathe."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And at that point, most of us will take a breath, won\u2019t we?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Exactly. Our body and brain is telling us \u2013 go on, breathe, take a breath! This strong feeling to do something is called an urge . To hold your breath for a long time you have to ignore that urge , you have to fight against it. So to train to do that, it\u2019s a waste of time taking a big breath, because holding your breath when you don\u2019t need to breathe isn\u2019t difficult \u2013 you have to practise fighting against that urge to breathe."

It\u2019s something actually quite intimidating , but after a while you get used to it and you learn to appreciate it actually that it\u2019s so quiet. Quiet and you\u2019re deprived of all sensations except the cold, of course, and so you hear your own heart beat because there\u2019s absolutely no sound."

And sensations are the way we experience the world, so sound, sight and smell. Diving in cold, dark silent waters you are deprived of many of our usual sensations, and that is spooky and intimidating ."

How far underwater do you have to go until the weight of water is equal in pressure to another atmosphere? Georgina, what did you say?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, that is actually the equivalent of 10 atmospheres! So the correct answer is 10 metres. Every 10 metres of depth in water is the equivalent to the weight and pressure of the air above us at sea level. There is a difference between fresh and salt water, but it\u2019s not so much as to make your answer correct! Well done if you got that answer right."
