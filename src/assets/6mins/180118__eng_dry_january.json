We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us and that's why you Catherine, have decided to quit \u2013 but only for a month."

And I'm not alone: A study of 857 British adults by Dr Richard de Visser from the University of Sussex found that after going for a month without alcohol, 62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep.

      "author": "Catherine",

      "author": "Catherine",

    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",

      "author": "Rob",
