He appeared on BBC radio's The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas?"

      "author": "Rob",

Perhaps it's the climate or British food so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it's now becoming mainstream . This means that is no longer something that is seen as being unusual or different. It's becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience."

      "author": "Neil",
