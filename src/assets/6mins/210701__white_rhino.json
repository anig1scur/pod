  "intro": [
    "Northern white rhinos are extinct in the wild. Conservationists are working on an artificial breeding programme, using eggs from the last two females in captivity in Kenya and sperm from a deceased male to preserve the species. Neil and Sam talk about the research by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, and teach you related vocabulary."
