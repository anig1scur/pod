But for women, particularly, I think we dress nicely for ourselves \u2013 not for anybody else. Sometimes I put on make-up \u2013 not because I'm going out \u2013 but because it makes me feel good."

But let's listen now to academic Philippa Dietrich from the University of the West of England, Bristol, talking about valuing ourselves for all our attributes \u2013 not just our appearance. INSERT Philippa Dietrich, University of the West of England, Bristol This focus just on appearance \u2013 on looks \u2013 really sends people the ideas that their bodies are just objects to be looked at. Having a belief system or focussing on your values in life or other attributes or personality characteristics or interests or anything else that's not to do with appearance is really important. Our bodies are not there to be looked that \u2013 they have functions. Neil What Philippa Dietrich said makes sense to me. We need to focus on our inner beauty. What do you think, Alice?"
