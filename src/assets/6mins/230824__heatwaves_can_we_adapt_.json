Living in cities where summer temperatures regularly exceed 45 degrees Celsius, Indians have been finding clever ways to keep their houses cool for over five thousand years. One of them is called \u2018jaali\u2019, but what exactly is it? Is \u2018jaali\u2019:"

      "text": "OK, Neil, we\u2019ll find out the answer later in the programme. In May 2022, the temperature in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in north India, reached 49.2 degrees Celsius. Roshni Diwakar is a consultant for the Mahila Housing Trust, an NGO helping poor Indian women to heat-proof their houses. These women often work from home while their husbands are out in the heat working on construction sites. Here Roshni describes a typical house to BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:"

They don't necessarily have illegal electric connections, and even if they do, they don't have electricity 24 hours a day - there are power cuts , especially in the summer months. Many of them have tin roofs which of course will really heat up. Health gets affected, because their health is affected their livelihood gets affected, because they\u2019re daily wage earners - if you don't work you don't earn."

      "text": "In this heat, sickness is common. Often the men can't work, which is a problem because they are the daily wage earners - someone who earns money on a day-to-day basis meaning that they will receive no money if they cannot work. Families spend most of the day outside in the street, and at night it's still too hot to sleep, even on the roof."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But fortunately, Roshni has been working on a clever cool roof solution \u2013 white paint. Painting reflective anti-solar white paint on the roof can reduce room temperatures by up to 4 degrees. It may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference and allows families to work, cook, and even sleep inside. Here\u2019s Roshni again, talking with BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:"

It's a great example of Indians skilfully finding ways of adapting to the heat \u2013 a modern version of \u2018jaali\u2019, you could say. So, what was the answer to your question, Beth? Was my idea - that \u2018jaali\u2019 is a honeycomb pattern used in windows \u2013 correct?"

The small holes keep out the sunlight, and cool down the air coming in. Neil OK, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with sweat - passing salty water through the skin to stay cool."
