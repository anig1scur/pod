Today we will learn how to become better writers for busy readers. My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast. Today I really look forward to speaking with Todd Rogers. Todd is a Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and is the Faculty Director of the Behavioral Insights Group. Todd teaches courses on the science of behavior change, and he\u2019s written a new book called Writing for Busy Readers: Communicate More Effectively in the Real World."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Todd, when you and I first got a chance to speak a while back, I felt like I was with a kindred spirit. We both have such a passion for communication. Thanks for being here. I\u2019m super excited to chat with you."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Thanks for having me, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So let\u2019s get started. My first question has to do with one of the subheadings I found in your book. It caught my attention. It read \u201cBetter Living through Effective Writing.\u201d First, I\u2019d love for you to define what you mean by effective writing. And second, how does writing well help us live better?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"I love this question because I think it is not initially obvious. So writing better makes it easier for readers. And the reason this improves everyone\u2019s lives is because it saves readers time and it\u2019s kinder. Writing effectively makes it easy for busy readers to navigate where we send them, pull out the key information, and do what they were planning to do anyway, which is move on to the next thing. And so it\u2019s more effective for us, and it\u2019s kinder to readers."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One thing that is very different about the way you approach your thoughts on writing is that you focus on the reader. Many others focus on what is actually written. Why is focusing on the reader so important, and what role does the reader\u2019s context play in how we write for them?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"I think you\u2019re right, that a lot of the way we think about writing is as if there were some idealized form. Writing well is the way you were taught to write in high school and college. And that\u2019s successful writing. What my coauthor on a lot of this work, including our book, and I have come to believe is that writing well is very different from writing effectively. And we should focus on how do we write effectively. And what that means is we should write in a way that reflects the way people actually read. And in the world, busy people are just constantly skimming. No one cares about our writings as much as we do. And the default behavior when reading is to move on and skip."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"So we need to write in a way that reflects and accommodates the reality that people are assuming what we write."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I agree. I skim all the time. Sometimes that gets me in trouble. What looks different in our writing? What actually tactically, in terms of the sentence structure, the words we use, what\u2019s different when you\u2019re writing for people who skim versus people who are trying to demonstrate they actually did their homework in a class."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Right. So when someone is skimming, they are jumping around. They are trying to pull out not linearly. They\u2019re just trying to jump around and figure out what\u2019s this about, do I need to do something, and when can I move on. And so when we watch with eye tracking, we see the people dart around and they try to get the gist of what we\u2019re saying without reading it closely. So what that means is we want to add structure. One of our six principles is design for navigation. Make it easy to design what we write for readers. So add headings, add structure so that a reader who jumps around can easily figure out what\u2019s going on. And any of the key points are up top, what [listing] [unintelligible] so they can orient themselves. They can jump around using headings, that you can use formatting to draw attention to the key information."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"But in addition to writing complete sentences that flow from one sentence to the next and have active verbs, we also need to write in a way that just reflects the reality that our readers are jumping around when they read. And so that means writing with structure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, you\u2019re preaching to the choir here. And part of the reason I think you and I get along so well is we both believe very strongly in structure. And when I was doing research for the new book I have coming out, I spoke with somebody who works for the Dummies organization, all those Dummies books, and she talked to me about wayfinding, how when you write, you need to think about helping people find their way through your content. And that\u2019s what I just heard you talking about, that structure helps people find their way in terms of what it is they\u2019re specifically looking for. And I think that\u2019s so important and thank you for highlighting that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You mentioned that your book has six principles that can help busy readers. I love that your principles are based on academic social science research. I think that\u2019s so important. Can you pick two other principles beyond structure that you believe are really important, and can you give us some concrete advice on how to apply those?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Sure. So one is less is more. And we have run lots and lots of randomized experiments that have something like this structure. We ran an experiment with a large political organization where they wrote a fundraising email that was six paragraphs. In one condition, with 350,000 people, they got the full fundraising message. In the other condition, we deleted every other paragraph arbitrarily. People read them both and thought it was incoherent in the shorter one because we just arbitrarily deleted paragraphs. And yet, the three-paragraph one raised more money than the longer one, even though it was incoherent. Just less is more. [Unintelligible] omitting needless words. That\u2019s easy, of course. Words are actually needless. Cut them. Great."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"The harder choices are omitting useful but not necessary words, or useful but not necessary ideas. And the idea is just the more you keep, the less likely it is that someone will read and respond to our message. So there\u2019s not a right answer to how much to keep. We just need to know there are tradeoffs. The more you add, the less likely people are to read and engage. But if they do, they\u2019re going to get more content. So fewer words, but also \u2014 not just needless words, also sometimes we have to make judgment calls where we eliminate useful detail that would just deter or distract from our core point."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it seems to me that we have to be very mindful of what we write and think about the reader\u2019s perspective. I think a lot of us are under such pressure just to get ideas down that we don\u2019t really think about prioritizing what\u2019s important for the read and making those tradeoffs you talked about. I\u2019m reminded of a saying that my mother has said all these years. I know she didn\u2019t create it, but it\u2019s, \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock.\u201d And I think a lot of us are clock builders when we write because that\u2019s our process, and we\u2019re trying to share that process with people. So I find that really interesting."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before I ask you to share one more of your principles, how much does word choice play into this? I mean, sometimes I read things where people, I think, are purposely trying to impress me with their vocabulary when, in fact, I think simpler might be better. So less is more. I also think simpler language use might be better. What do you think?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"The second principle I might share is make reading easy. That means short, common words, short sentences, simply grammar. And the idea here is that it is easier to read writing that is written in this way. So it requires less effort. It\u2019s less taxing. It\u2019s more pleasant, easy and fast to read. Additionally, it\u2019s accessible to more people. So this is a second point: In addition to just being more likely to be read and responded to, it also is more accessible and inclusive. So the median U.S. adult reads at a ninth-grade reading level."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Very often when we write these sentences, they\u2019re complex. They\u2019re complete. They\u2019re beautifully written with flowing prose. But they\u2019re kind of inaccessible to a large chunk of potential readers. And one of my favorite parts of writing the book \u2014 and I imagine you had the same experience writing your book \u2014 I love learning about this literature that I had never encountered before. One of these huge areas of research is on eye tracking, how people\u2019s eyes move when they read."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And if you can get people to read, actually attentively, carefully read, which is rarely the way we actually read, but if you get people to read like that, what you see is a word-word-word-word-period. And then at the period, they pause for the period-pause effect. And they sit there making it as if they are making sense of did I get the whole idea. And if they didn\u2019t, they go backwards, and they jump backwards and reread. That\u2019s a pain. It\u2019s cognitively difficult. It requires effort. It makes people less likely to continue. Given that everyone, especially if it\u2019s kind of practical writing \u2014 texts, emails, reports, pitches \u2014 they\u2019ve got lots of things in their queue."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And so the easier we make the reading, the faster it is it\u2019ll be for the reader to get through and the more accessible it\u2019ll be to more people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love that eye-tracking behavior. That\u2019s fascinating to me. Thank you for sharing that. I had never thought about that. But sure, you can actually measure if we\u2019re making it difficult. I have two follow-up questions, if you\u2019ll allow me, Todd. One, it strikes me that if I write in a way that is easier for my reader to digest, that I am actually making that experience a little more pleasant for them. They\u2019re not as frustrated. How does emotion play in what you write? I can imagine that if I write something that the material I\u2019m covering is emotional in nature, that can be helpful in some ways, right, because people are engaging in a different way. But also, their experience of reading might bring about an emotion as well."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I mean, I remember back in high school when I was having to read texts that I was not that interested in. I got frustrated when I was reading \u2014 I\u2019m not going to mention any books because I don\u2019t want anybody [laughs] to see what I found offensive. But what are your thoughts on that?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"The kinds of writing that I mainly [object] \u2014 so this book\u2019s coauthored with my longtime coauthor Jessica Lasky-Fink. And the kind of writing that we\u2019re really focused on \u2014 and this all originated with advising organization leaders during the pandemic communicating to their stakeholders and employees and constituents \u2014 is practical writing. When we are writing to our families via text or to our colleagues via email or Slack or in sales proposals to potential clients or current clients, it\u2019s practical writing. And so it\u2019s not going to be the literature that we sometimes associate with when we think of [unintelligible] writing. So how do we write practical [range]."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"That said, there are ways to be more persuasive and more compelling. All of that is conditional, or rather requires that people are paying attention. And so I have spent the last 20 years developing interventions to increase people\u2019s likelihood of voting or increase people\u2019s likelihood of choosing healthy foods or increasing students\u2019 likelihood of going to school by communicating with families. And all of those are these interventions [in the field] to change behaviors. What I only recently realized is that seeing zero would [proceed] all of the persuasion and behavioral science that I and my colleagues have been developing is, do they pay any attention to what we\u2019re sending them, to our communications?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And very often, if it\u2019s very dense, they just don\u2019t even bother engaging at all. Or if they do engage, they engage superficially before just moving on and say I\u2019ll get back to that later. And so for me, the big context is how do we get to the \u2014 before we can be emotionally evocative or persuasive or structure things using different kinds of framing, we need to write the way that people will engage and process deeply enough to even get our messages through."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to come back to this question of engagement because I think it\u2019s very critical. But before I do, you said writing simply and using structure can help. Do you have data or an opinion on the use of lists and bullet points because at one level, a list and bullet points, to me, appears structured, and it in many ways is simpler than prose with subjects, nouns, et cetera. But I also know that processing lists can be hard for people. What\u2019s your take on bullet points and lists to help people read what\u2019s written better?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Assuming that they\u2019re used to organize related ideas, I think lists are fantastic, like bullet points, for example. So typically, there is an agreed upon meaning of bullets. We all agree that if there is a sentence and then a bunch of bullet points, that each of the bullet points resembles each other in some way and some kind and that they are all related to the preceding sentence. And so that licenses the reader, if they understand what the preceding sentence was, to just skip the bullets if they don\u2019t \u2014 if it\u2019s not relevant to them. They [also] tell us that each bullet is an independent idea and that they\u2019re distinct. Again, the goal through everything is how do we make it easier for the reader to navigate and understand what we\u2019re trying to convey."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You have changed my perspective. So thank you for that. I have actively dissuaded people from using bullet points and lists. But I see their value in a written form. I still think I hold my position that, when you\u2019re speaking and you\u2019re putting a slide up behind you, lists can be challenging for your audience. So I appreciate the balance we have to find of leveraging visual structure through bullet points and lists without going overboard and doing too much, which brings me back to the idea that you mentioned just a bit ago around engagement. I\u2019d love for you to talk about how readers choose to engage or not with writing. And give me specifically some techniques that writers can use to increase a reader\u2019s engagement."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"I gave a talk today at an academic conference where I opened with, \u201cRaise your hand if you\u2019ve ever received a text message, and you looked at it and it was \u2014 and you\u2019re like I can\u2019t deal with this now, and you postpone dealing with it.\u201d And everyone\u2019s hand goes up. And then I said, \u201cKeep your hand up if it has ever happened that you didn\u2019t get back to it.\u201d And everyone\u2019s hand stays up, right, which is \u2014 actually the shortest mode of communication that\u2019s possible, which is our text messages, even those, people look at, \u201cI just can\u2019t deal with that.\u201d And that\u2019s the first version of disengagement, which is not even processing it at all or figure out what it\u2019s about. That\u2019s like the first version of not engaging at all."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"The second stage is, while you\u2019re reading, how deeply you engage versus \u2014 do you really read sentence by sentence or are you darting around. And very often, it\u2019s just darting around. And so there are strategies you can use that a lot of it is influence and behavioral science on increasing people\u2019s interest or personal relevance of content or the pleasure they get in the language used. But for us, starting point is let\u2019s just make it as easy as possible for the reader to leave the message with the key information we\u2019re trying to convey. And from there, then we can start to leverage these other tools of social and behavioral science."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So we\u2019ve just got to get them to focus and pay attention. So this brings up another question \u2014 obviously, this isn\u2019t appropriate for all writing: What role do icons, emoticons, emojis have because, in some ways, those are engaging. I will look at a text that has emojis in it in a different way than one that just has words. Do you have a position on that? Is there research behind that?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"I love the phrase, \u201cDo you have a position on it?\u201d The only thing that Jessica and I have a position on is that our readers are busy, and we need to write in a way that makes it as easy for them to read what we are saying as possible. That will be most effective for us in achieving our goals as writers, and it\u2019s also kinder by saving them time. That said, there\u2019s been a bunch of research on emojis that I think is really fun. One, there are lots of courts \u2014 federal, state, international courts that have ruled on the meaning of emojis in financial documents. And it wouldn\u2019t surprise you if I told you that a bunch of crypto communications sometimes involve emojis. And courts have tried to interpret what those mean as contractually binding or not."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"That\u2019s interesting enough. But here\u2019s the most interesting thing: There are surveys showing that different generations \u2014 me being a middle-aged guy versus my kids \u2014 will interpret the same emojis meaning something different."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"So a smiley face to me means warm feelings, probably agreement, maybe humor. And to my 13-year-old-daughter, a smiley face means sarcasm and irony. And so even just those kinds of generational differences, meaning wow, emotions are dangerous for clarity because they are interpreted in different ways by different people. That\u2019s just generational. You can imagine different people have different meanings for different emojis. So I think they have a place as long as you know your audience and they are unambiguously both appropriate, meaning they somehow fit the norms of your organization, and you have confidence that it can be interpreted the way you think [it is]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I give you a thumbs-up emoji on that answer. And to me that means a good answer."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think the jury is still out, literally and figuratively. So thank you. You mentioned norms, and I want to dig into that. You talk in your book about norm, status, and identity. What do you mean by this, and why does it even matter for the writing that we do?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"We are most effective when we make it easy for our reader to read what we are sending them. And one of the things we talked about is using fewer words, fewer ideas, shorter. Another is writing simply. Another is designing it, adding structure, and you said wayfinding throughout the writing, like navigation. Those are generally true. But different people in different contexts with different norms have different expectations on them when they write. So when there are a bunch of State Department emails that were released where lower-status people writing up wrote longer, more indirect messages, whereas higher-status people communicating down were shorter and more direct."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"If you are lower status, there\u2019s a lot of like defensive writer where you\u2019re not sure how you\u2019re going to be interpreted. You\u2019re very concerned about how you\u2019re going to be understood and what people are going to think of you. So you as a writer, [any] person listening has to really navigate the unequal burdens on writers and the way we are interpreted. But the thing that is universally true is busy and probably skimming. And so you want to make it as easy as possible for them. One thing that I teach when I teach \u2014 with leaders about how to communicate \u2014 and I think this will resonate with you having read your book \u2014 that one thing leaders can do is set norms for how do we communicate."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And in the U.S. Army, there is a regulation \u2014 an actual codified regulation called BLUF, Bottom Line Up Front. An enlisted person writing to a general, Bottom Line Up Front, the first sentence is the bottom line. A general writing down to an enlisted person, Bottom Line Up Front. First sentence is the bottom. line. And by making that a rule and a norm of the organization, it is easier for writers to make sure that they\u2019re effective. It\u2019s easier for readers because they know exactly where to get the bottom line, and it also protects the lower-status people from the kind of burden of navigating ambiguous concerns about how they\u2019re going to be interpreted."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And so as leaders, we just set norms to make it more effective and also protect the lower-status writers."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That point is so critical and one I think all of us should think about in the roles we serve in organizations. What\u2019s important is the information we convey, but we can also help set the norms and expectations for what that communication should look like and read like. And I don\u2019t think many organizations do that, save maybe the military or some governmental agency or something highly regulated. I think that\u2019s a wonderful idea. I often encourage the organizations I consult to think about their communication infrastructure. And I\u2019m talking about do you use email versus Slack versus texting for certain things. I think they should add to that this notion of what makes for good writing, and how can we make it easier on the people who are doing the reading. So thank you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Todd, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you a series of questions. Two of them are similar across all our guests, and then I have one random question I\u2019m going to ask. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Let\u2019s do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. Let\u2019s start with the random question first. What is a pet peeve of yours that bothers you in the writing that you see of people?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Writing can serve at least two purposes. One is clarifying our thinking. And the other is communicate the magical idea of getting an idea from my head into your head without us directly interacting. That second one is magic, but the first one is also helping us clarify our own thinking. And I think what can be frustrating as a reader is if people don\u2019t realize those are two separate things. And when they\u2019re writing, they write starting wherever they thought they were starting and ending in a different place. And at the end is where they really want the key message to get across to me. And it would probably be better if they took the perspective, how do I make it easier for the reader? The reader doesn\u2019t need to know where you started. The reader needs to know what\u2019s the key information."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Those are two different functions, and editing and revising is the key to getting from the first to the second."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well put. My pet peeve is along those lines. It\u2019s people who start from an assumption that you are where they are. It\u2019s that cursive knowledge. And that really can be frustrating and sometimes very intimidating. So question number two, and you can take this as any kind of communication \u2014 written, spoken, et cetera. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"I\u2019m going to take this I think in a direction others have not. I really like the approach of Don Norman, who is the founder of User-Centered Design and wrote a book called \u201cThe Design of Everyday Things.\u201d And I\u2019m not talking about his writing, although he\u2019s prolific. His like basic philosophy is if you\u2019ve designed an object and the user interacts with it and does not understand how to use it, it\u2019s on you the designer. It\u2019s never the user\u2019s fault. It\u2019s always the designer\u2019s fault, and that design is a form of communication."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"And Jessica and I have that basic philosophy when it comes to writing \u2014 practical writing. Even if my writing is super clear, and if you had read the whole thing, you\u2019d understand why we\u2019re doing this and what time it is and where it\u2019s happening and what you\u2019re supposed to bring, if I send it to you and you don\u2019t pull those information pieces from it, that\u2019s on me, not on you. It\u2019s the \u2014 it\u2019s always on the writer to make sure it gets through to the busy reader. And it\u2019s not just about clarity. It\u2019s about actually accommodating the fact that this person \u2014 that our readers are busy and skimming."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Very important. The design of your messages matters. Final question: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe"},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Three things: goal, context, and revising. Goal \u2014 we have to know what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. And maybe writing can help us figure that out. But we have to be super clear in our goal. And then from there, we write, and we have to know our context \u2014 what are the norms, what are the expectations, how are we going to be interpreted, how much detail is expected of us or needed or wanted. And then revising is applying the six principles of writing for busy people, which we talked about three of them, but \u2014. So it\u2019s clarity of goal, know your context, and revising. Unfortunately, all of them are hard."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But necessary, but necessary. In the work I do around oral communication, speaking, they\u2019re identical. This notion of iteration is critical. And it\u2019s a process. Many of us just think, I\u2019ve got to get it out and it\u2019s done. But it\u2019s actually an iterative process, and I appreciate that, as do I appreciate this whole conversation, Todd. You certainly didn\u2019t disappoint. Your information was very valuable."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Allow me to structure it clearly. Point one: People are busy. Write to make it easier for them. Point two: We have to consider the context when we write. And context includes norms, status, et cetera. And point three: Learning to write better is something that you can do, and it\u2019s worth the effort. Todd, thank you so much. I wish you well on all that you do, especially with your book, \u201cWriting for Busy Readers: Communicate More Effectively in the Real World.\u201d Thank you."},{"author":"Todd Rogers","text":"Thank you, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

So writing better makes it easier for readers. And the reason this improves everyone\u2019s lives is because it saves readers time and it\u2019s kinder. Writing effectively makes it easy for busy readers to navigate where we send them, pull out the key information, and do what they were planning to do anyway, which is move on to the next thing. And so it\u2019s more effective for us, and it\u2019s kinder to readers."]},{"begin":"110.000","end":"128.960","lines":["One thing that is very different about the way you approach your thoughts on writing is that you focus on the reader. Many others focus on what is actually written.

Writing well is the way you were taught to write in high school and college. And that\u2019s successful writing. What my coauthor on a lot of this work, including our book, and I have come to believe is that writing well is very different from writing effectively. And we should focus on how do we write effectively. And what that means is we should write in a way that reflects the way people actually read. And in the world, busy people are just constantly skimming. No one cares about our writings as much as we do. And the default behavior when reading is to move on and skip."]},{"begin":"176.000","end":"182.280","lines":["So we need to write in a way that reflects and accommodates the reality that people are assuming what we write."]},{"begin":"182.280","end":"201.440","lines":["I agree. I skim all the time. Sometimes that gets me in trouble. What looks different in our writing? What actually tactically, in terms of the sentence structure, the words we use, what\u2019s different when you\u2019re writing for people who skim versus people who are trying to demonstrate they actually did their homework in a class."]},{"begin":"201.440","end":"252.120","lines":["Right. So when someone is skimming, they are jumping around. They are trying to pull out not linearly. They\u2019re just trying to jump around and figure out what\u2019s this about, do I need to do something, and when can I move on. And so when we watch with eye tracking, we see the people dart around and they try to get the gist of what we\u2019re saying without reading it closely. So what that means is we want to add structure. One of our six principles is design for navigation. Make it easy to design what we write for readers. So add headings, add structure so that a reader who jumps around can easily figure out what\u2019s going on. And any of the key points are up top, what [listing] [unintelligible] so they can orient themselves. They can jump around using headings, that you can use formatting to draw attention to the key information."]},{"begin":"252.120","end":"266.880","lines":["But in addition to writing complete sentences that flow from one sentence to the next and have active verbs, we also need to write in a way that just reflects the reality that our readers are jumping around when they read.

And part of the reason I think you and I get along so well is we both believe very strongly in structure. And when I was doing research for the new book I have coming out, I spoke with somebody who works for the Dummies organization, all those Dummies books, and she talked to me about wayfinding, how when you write, you need to think about helping people find their way through your content. And that\u2019s what I just heard you talking about, that structure helps people find their way in terms of what it is they\u2019re specifically looking for.

So one is less is more. And we have run lots and lots of randomized experiments that have something like this structure. We ran an experiment with a large political organization where they wrote a fundraising email that was six paragraphs. In one condition, with 350,000 people, they got the full fundraising message. In the other condition, we deleted every other paragraph arbitrarily. People read them both and thought it was incoherent in the shorter one because we just arbitrarily deleted paragraphs. And yet, the three-paragraph one raised more money than the longer one, even though it was incoherent. Just less is more. [Unintelligible] omitting needless words. That\u2019s easy, of course. Words are actually needless. Cut them. Great."]},{"begin":"370.760","end":"406.240","lines":["The harder choices are omitting useful but not necessary words, or useful but not necessary ideas.

We just need to know there are tradeoffs. The more you add, the less likely people are to read and engage. But if they do, they\u2019re going to get more content. So fewer words, but also \u2014 not just needless words, also sometimes we have to make judgment calls where we eliminate useful detail that would just deter or distract from our core point."]},{"begin":"406.240","end":"430.840","lines":["So it seems to me that we have to be very mindful of what we write and think about the reader\u2019s perspective.

I\u2019m reminded of a saying that my mother has said all these years. I know she didn\u2019t create it, but it\u2019s, \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock.\u201d And I think a lot of us are clock builders when we write because that\u2019s our process, and we\u2019re trying to share that process with people. So I find that really interesting."]},{"begin":"430.840","end":"450.200","lines":["Before I ask you to share one more of your principles, how much does word choice play into this?

It\u2019s more pleasant, easy and fast to read. Additionally, it\u2019s accessible to more people.

One, it strikes me that if I write in a way that is easier for my reader to digest, that I am actually making that experience a little more pleasant for them. They\u2019re not as frustrated. How does emotion play in what you write? I can imagine that if I write something that the material I\u2019m covering is emotional in nature, that can be helpful in some ways, right, because people are engaging in a different way.

When we are writing to our families via text or to our colleagues via email or Slack or in sales proposals to potential clients or current clients, it\u2019s practical writing.

But before I do, you said writing simply and using structure can help. Do you have data or an opinion on the use of lists and bullet points because at one level, a list and bullet points, to me, appears structured, and it in many ways is simpler than prose with subjects, nouns, et cetera. But I also know that processing lists can be hard for people.

So typically, there is an agreed upon meaning of bullets. We all agree that if there is a sentence and then a bunch of bullet points, that each of the bullet points resembles each other in some way and some kind and that they are all related to the preceding sentence. And so that licenses the reader, if they understand what the preceding sentence was, to just skip the bullets if they don\u2019t \u2014 if it\u2019s not relevant to them. They [also] tell us that each bullet is an independent idea and that they\u2019re distinct.

So I appreciate the balance we have to find of leveraging visual structure through bullet points and lists without going overboard and doing too much, which brings me back to the idea that you mentioned just a bit ago around engagement.
