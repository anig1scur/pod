Economic concepts hold in all areas of life, which Oyer's research has explored in everything from Uber driving and online dating to most recently, sports.","\u201cEconomics is everywhere,\u201d Oyer says. \u201cIt's an incredibly powerful lens to analyze almost anything in the real world.\u201d"],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The very first class I ever took in college was an economics class. I learned so much, and I learned how little I knew about economics. Today I look forward to continuing that education. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart : The Podcast. Today I\u2019m excited to be joined by Paul Oyer. He is the Mary and Rankine [Van] Anda Entrepreneurial Professor and Professor of Economics. Additionally, Paul is Senior Associate Dean for Academic affairs at the GSB. He studies the economics of organizations and human resource practices."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Paul also has a unique research approach. He drove for Uber, studied online dating, and he explores the sports world in his newest book, \u201cAn Economist Goes to the Game: How to Throw Away $580 Million and Other Surprising Insights from the Economics of Sports.\u201d Hey, Paul, welcome to the podcast. I am super excited to have you here."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"I am super excited to be here. Thanks, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Awesome. Let\u2019s get started. First, congratulations on your new book. In this book, like your previous book \u201cRoadside MBA,\u201d you teach us important, often unexpected economic lessons. I\u2019m curious what motivates your research and approach, and do you have any favorite notions or ideas that stick out from your writing and research?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Yeah, I just think the main thing really that I try to get across is that economics is everywhere. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful lens to analyze almost anything in the real world. And I think a lot of listeners might think, oh, economics, that\u2019s very abstract and dry, remembering some class they took in economics I mean in college. But I see it very differently. Everywhere you look, economics is guiding what\u2019s going on. So you mentioned the book \u201cRoadside MBA,\u201d which I wrote with a couple of other economists. And in that book, it was a strategy book for small businesspeople. There were no numbers and equations \u2013"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"\u2013 none of that. It was just taking simple economic ideas and seeing how small business owners could put them into action. So for example, in that book we talk to a bowling alley owner in Kansas. And this guy was very interesting, and he had the problem of too many people applying for every job. And so he would put a job listing in the paper, and so many people would [laughs] come down. And he wanted to separate the sort of serious people from the not so serious people. And he said \u2013 I remember him telling us he definitely ruled out the people who showed up in their pajamas, which I was surprised was an issue. But the other lesson he told us was, he said, \u201cLook, I learned at some point, put in the ad \u2018bring a pencil so you can fill in the application.\u2019\u201d And it was that little test of whether you cared enough to notice that and bring it, that sounds so simple, but it really is a classic economic model from Mike Spence, the former Dean of the GSB, that kind of can explain that behavior. I\u2019m not saying that the bowling alley guy had read Mike Spence\u2019s paper. I\u2019m afraid that probably was not true. But Mike Spence was able to capture through an economic model an idea that was very powerful in the real world."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"The same goes \u2013 I wrote a book where I talk about economics and how you can understand online dating. Again, the first chapter of that book is taking this Nobel Prize winning idea \u2013 I didn\u2019t win the Nobel Prize [laughs] \u2013"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"\u2013 a couple of people including a labor economist named Dale Mortensen did for what\u2019s known as search theory. And if you take their ideas, that model explains what we think of as settling in the dating market."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"So people are very afraid of settling in the dating market. And it\u2019s really \u2013 believe it or not, that\u2019s an economic concept. And then the final example I give you is out of the new book. My favorite \u2013 there are so many great sports things about economics, but my \u2013 one of my favorites in the new book is Korean women golfers completely dominate the sport. That goes down to some basic underlying things such as the savings rate in Korea, the way schools are set up, and then the gender pay gap in the Korean labor market. So again, all \u2013 the context that runs through all of those is economics is a powerful lens by which to understand the world we live in."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So by understanding economics, we can have a better understanding of the world. And the take-home message here: Don\u2019t wear pajamas to interviews and make sure that you have a pencil when you show up. Very good. As you know, this podcast focuses on communication. Can you share a lesson or two from your research that provides some insight into communication?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Sure. I study what\u2019s known as personnel or organizational economics, which is the economics within firms. And it\u2019s not just in that setting but, in many settings, economists focus on the importance of credibility. So it\u2019s not the way you or I would think about like how do you speak \u2013 how does Obama or somebody who\u2019s really good come across as credible. It\u2019s how do my actions separate things that I say that may or may not be true from things that are actual and true. And I think understanding the economic concept of repeated [games] and how to make yourself credible is really important for communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. We spend a lot of time talking about credibility and how to drive for congruence between what you say and what you do and how others judge you based on that."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Matt Abrahams: Credibility really is important. And I didn\u2019t realize that I was also teaching economics while I was teaching communication."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"You are. Everybody\u2019s teaching economics."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to get back to the serious stuff, Paul. I want to go back to your research on online dating. Can you walk us through what cheap talk is, how it plays out in dating and in business, and how can we overcome it so we\u2019re perceived as meaning what we say?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Often you can think about people, when they say something, whether or not there\u2019s any reason to believe them. What have they \u2013 cheap talk is something you can say where, if it\u2019s true or not true, there\u2019s no obvious way to tell them apart."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"So for example, when I wrote this book about online dating, the classic examples in there would be online dating profiles, men tend to overstate their income and their height \u2013 for example. So in a world of cheap talk, you can lie and get away with it, but you can\u2019t lie too big because when you actually go to meet the person at some point, if you say you\u2019re six-two, if you\u2019re six-one or five-eleven maybe, which then you have an incentive to say you\u2019re six feet, but if you\u2019re really five-four, that\u2019s not going to be a very good strategy. So again, it comes back to where can you build credibility. An example of this in the sports book is steroids. Any time you hear somebody say, \u201cI am not using performance-enhancing drugs,\u201d you really have no reason to believe them because the person who is and is not using them has the incentive to say exactly the same thing. So a good mechanism for getting good of cheap talk is one where you can somehow find a way to separate the cheaters from the non-cheaters or the liars from the non-liars, however you want to look at it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So beyond studying online dating and cheap talk, you also chose to drive an Uber. What was that experience like, and what did you learn from it except how to get places better?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"You know, you don\u2019t learn how to get places better because these days [ways] [laughs] can take you anywhere you want to go. So that\u2019s not that useful from that perspective. So I\u2019m a labor economist, and in addition to writing these books, I write research papers. I\u2019ve studied lawyers. I\u2019ve studied the market for investment bankers and a bunch of other trades. And boy, I wish I could try those jobs for two weeks because you learn so much that helps structure your research questions. When we started studying Uber \u2013 and this was joint research with my Stanford colleague Rebecca Diamond and a few other people \u2013 we started studying Uber, and you can do that. The barriers to entry to being an Uber driver are so low that I just went and registered my car and tried it. And it was fascinating. Now the main benefits of it were from the research study perspective where I learned a lot about how to think about the value of experience in that context, which was really important for what we were doing."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"But it also [laughs] just was fun. I don\u2019t want to be an Uber driver for my whole life. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019m able to work at Stanford. But I really wish I could do it both for the research side, but also it was just interesting. So at the time as I was doing that job, my stepson was working at Chipotle. And we were making about the same amount of money. And it was interesting because there\u2019s a large set of people for whom working at a job like working at Chipotle is a much better fit because they like the camaraderie and they like being told, be here at this hour, and leave at this hour. There\u2019s a larger set who need the flexibility, who like the alone time."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"And so it\u2019s nice that there are these various options out there. And then there\u2019s just other really interesting stuff that, at least in the short term, makes driving for Uber interesting. For example, I was very lucky \u2013 I didn\u2019t do it for that long. I never had a passenger who was nasty. They were always pleasant, interesting people. Some of them were very quiet, but some of them were interesting. And then also, you drive all around the Bay Area, and you see these neighborhoods that you only pass on the highway. And it\u2019s like, wow, what is that neighborhood like \u2013"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"\u2013 that I\u2019ve only seen on a 280 exit ramp?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. So I have a very personal question for you. What was your Uber rating when you were done?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Ah, that\u2019s a great \u2013 it\u2019s 4.97, and I\u2019m very \u2013 I brag about it a lot, I can tell you. And by the way, there was one other economist who also drove for Uber. His name is Josh Angrist, and he won the Nobel Prize, but I had a higher Uber rating, so I call it a draw [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, that\u2019s a draw, for sure. As a communication person, I want to \u201cdrive\u201d down this road a little farther. Were there certain things you did that you think increased your ratings? As an economist, I would think you would have some insight into things you could do to improve your ratings."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Well, so for one thing, what I \u2013 and this comes back to some of the stuff I do research on \u2013 for one thing, I never tried to game the ratings."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"And I think that in this case, you don\u2019t want to do that. So I never told people, \u201cGive me a high rating,\u201d or bribe them with mints or anything like that. I just tried to be courteous and on time and do a good job. And now I did have a nice car, so [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I see. Maybe that helped. So it sounds to me like what helped you get such a high rating, above a Nobel Laureate\u2019s rating \u2013 was the fact that you were being congruent and credible \u2013"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now you mentioned you\u2019re a labor economist. And so you\u2019ve been studying how work has been changing. I\u2019m curious, what have you concluded, and what advice would you have for those listening in who are looking for work or looking to change their work?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"So first of all, I would say now is a really good time to be looking for work. So a lot of what makes you successful in the job market is the macro-economic conditions at the time you\u2019re looking. I\u2019ve actually done research on this showing that people who graduate during good economic times, they have \u2013 they get benefits that last a long time. And by the same token, now is a good time to be switching jobs and finding just the right job, given the state of the job market."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"But actually, in terms of the overall trends in the labor market, there\u2019s some evidence emerging \u2013 and it\u2019s a relatively new research area \u2013 to suggest that communication skills are becoming more valuable in the labor market. We\u2019ll see how important it is and how well that gets backed up. But because jobs are more white-collar in nature and often at a distanced and whatnot, social and communication skills are becoming more important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I know writing a book takes a long time from when you complete it to when it comes out. So I\u2019m curious, since you\u2019ve finished your previous book, what are you currently working on? What\u2019s the next crazy job you\u2019re going to look into?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Yeah, I wish I had a good \u2013 a better answer to that. But mostly, the crazy job I\u2019ve been looking into lately is being Senior Associate Dean of the Stanford Business School."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Heh."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"And I\u2019m trying to help, among many people here at the GSB, keeping the trains on the track during COVID, which \u2013"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"\u2013 obviously, was a challenge to all educational institutions everywhere. So that was the short-term thing. But then in the longer term, I think we can now start turning our attention to what did we learn from COVID. And as the \u2013 some of those technical changes we talked about in the job market are taking hold in education, what do we need to do to keep the Business School up to date? How should programs change? How should the way we teach change? And that\u2019s just an exciting thing to be able to be part of here at the GSB."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. And I have to say as somebody who is the recipient of your work and others, I was very impressed with how timely and transparent you were. Things were changing dramatically. And that\u2019s not to say that mistakes weren\u2019t made, and things had to be adjusted, but the transparency and timeliness was very helpful. And I think that\u2019s important for all communications."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Thanks."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. Does that sound all right?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"I would love it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would that be?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"My answer is so unbelievably trite and clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true, and that\u2019s just Keep It Simple. As academics, and especially as economists, we have such an urge, such a natural urge to complicate things. And it\u2019s just so unhelpful. I mean, I would much rather get a simple message across quickly and say it over and over again than try to get through every nuance."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well said. Taking your advice. Excellent. Very good. My second question is, who\u2019s a communicator that you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"Can I cheat and give two answers?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes, sir, you may."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"[Laughs] So there\u2019s a novelist, Richard Russo. My favorite book of his is \u201cEmpire Falls,\u201d but he has many other great books. And then a nonfiction writer \u2013 I read a lot of his books. He\u2019s now deceased. William Manchester wrote \u201cA Biography of Churchill\u201d and a book \u2013 some other \u2013 many other books I\u2019ve read. What\u2019s great is they communicate through stories."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"And they have a point, but if they just said the point, you wouldn\u2019t remember it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"It\u2019s the way they weave it together in a story that captures you. I\u2019m very much an admirer of people who do that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We have had Jennifer on, and we have talked about story a lot, and it\u2019s a really important point. Just giving data and lists are hard for us to remember. But if you can weave those together into a clear narrative, it can be very helpful. Final question: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"I think both in economics and in my role in the classroom, a couple of things come to mind. One is, often, I like to start presentations with one graph that tells the whole story."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh yeah."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"And then the rest is just details. One graph, and just the rest is gravy. I really like that. And along a similar line, a second idea is one story or anecdote that exemplifies the point you want to make. So for example, if I went in to teach Mike Spence\u2019s model that I was talking about earlier, I might start with a graph of some sort that gets at the idea in the underlying economics and tell the story of the pencil or something along those lines. And then I think just in a setting like an economics seminar in the classroom, in both those settings, I think a third ingredient would be transparently and sincerely addressing the questions and concerns that arise."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"The goal of learning is it all comes from back and forth and, frankly, from disagreements and arguments. So one thing I\u2019d love to see us do more at the GSB over time is, we\u2019re such a friendly place, we are afraid to disagree with one another. And I don\u2019t mean like disagree and fight and be uncivil. I mean civil disagreement that leads to learning. So \u2014."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I disagree. No, I actually agree with everything that you said there. And you\u2019re quite consistent. I mean, really what you\u2019re talking about in those first two ingredients is that notion of credibility and being congruent. And then the second element there really is in line with what you talked about earlier around really engaging with the ideas. Well, Paul, it has been a pleasure to chat with you. Your insights and approach to research and the things you study are fascinating. I love that you experience the things that you research. And best of luck with your new book, \u201cAn Economist Goes to the Game: How to Throw Away $580 Million Dollars and Other Surprising Insights from the Economics of Sports.\u201d Thanks, Paul."},{"author":"Paul Oyer","text":"& Thank you so much, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve been listening to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, a production of Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Let\u2019s get started. First, congratulations on your new book. In this book, like your previous book \u201cRoadside MBA,\u201d you teach us important, often unexpected economic lessons. I\u2019m curious what motivates your research and approach, and do you have any favorite notions or ideas that stick out from your writing and research?"]},{"begin":"94.160","end":"129.160","lines":["Yeah, I just think the main thing really that I try to get across is that economics is everywhere. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful lens to analyze almost anything in the real world. And I think a lot of listeners might think, oh, economics, that\u2019s very abstract and dry, remembering some class they took in economics I mean in college. But I see it very differently. Everywhere you look, economics is guiding what\u2019s going on. So you mentioned the book \u201cRoadside MBA,\u201d which I wrote with a couple of other economists. And in that book, it was a strategy book for small businesspeople. There were no numbers and equations \u2013"]},{"begin":"129.160","end":"129.400","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"129.400","end":"201.840","lines":["\u2013 none of that. It was just taking simple economic ideas and seeing how small business owners could put them into action. So for example, in that book we talk to a bowling alley owner in Kansas. And this guy was very interesting, and he had the problem of too many people applying for every job. And so he would put a job listing in the paper, and so many people would [laughs] come down. And he wanted to separate the sort of serious people from the not so serious people. And he said \u2013 I remember him telling us he definitely ruled out the people who showed up in their pajamas, which I was surprised was an issue. But the other lesson he told us was, he said, \u201cLook, I learned at some point, put in the ad \u2018bring a pencil so you can fill in the application.\u2019\u201d And it was that little test of whether you cared enough to notice that and bring it, that sounds so simple, but it really is a classic economic model from Mike Spence, the former Dean of the GSB, that kind of can explain that behavior. I\u2019m not saying that the bowling alley guy had read Mike Spence\u2019s paper. I\u2019m afraid that probably was not true. But Mike Spence was able to capture through an economic model an idea that was very powerful in the real world."]},{"begin":"201.840","end":"215.680","lines":["The same goes \u2013 I wrote a book where I talk about economics and how you can understand online dating.

And it\u2019s really \u2013 believe it or not, that\u2019s an economic concept. And then the final example I give you is out of the new book. My favorite \u2013 there are so many great sports things about economics, but my \u2013 one of my favorites in the new book is Korean women golfers completely dominate the sport. That goes down to some basic underlying things such as the savings rate in Korea, the way schools are set up, and then the gender pay gap in the Korean labor market. So again, all \u2013 the context that runs through all of those is economics is a powerful lens by which to understand the world we live in."]},{"begin":"269.120","end":"289.040","lines":["So by understanding economics, we can have a better understanding of the world. And the take-home message here: Don\u2019t wear pajamas to interviews and make sure that you have a pencil when you show up. Very good. As you know, this podcast focuses on communication. Can you share a lesson or two from your research that provides some insight into communication?"]},{"begin":"289.040","end":"327.840","lines":["Sure. I study what\u2019s known as personnel or organizational economics, which is the economics within firms. And it\u2019s not just in that setting but, in many settings, economists focus on the importance of credibility. So it\u2019s not the way you or I would think about like how do you speak \u2013 how does Obama or somebody who\u2019s really good come across as credible. It\u2019s how do my actions separate things that I say that may or may not be true from things that are actual and true. And I think understanding the economic concept of repeated [games] and how to make yourself credible is really important for communication."]},{"begin":"327.840","end":"337.680","lines":["Absolutely. We spend a lot of time talking about credibility and how to drive for congruence between what you say and what you do and how others judge you based on that."]},{"begin":"337.680","end":"337.840","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"337.840","end":"343.800","lines":["Matt Abrahams: Credibility really is important.

Everybody\u2019s teaching economics."]},{"begin":"345.600","end":"359.560","lines":["I want to get back to the serious stuff, Paul. I want to go back to your research on online dating. Can you walk us through what cheap talk is, how it plays out in dating and in business, and how can we overcome it so we\u2019re perceived as meaning what we say?"]},{"begin":"359.560","end":"373.520","lines":["Often you can think about people, when they say something, whether or not there\u2019s any reason to believe them. What have they \u2013 cheap talk is something you can say where, if it\u2019s true or not true, there\u2019s no obvious way to tell them apart."]},{"begin":"373.520","end":"442.040","lines":["So for example, when I wrote this book about online dating, the classic examples in there would be online dating profiles, men tend to overstate their income and their height \u2013 for example. So in a world of cheap talk, you can lie and get away with it, but you can\u2019t lie too big because when you actually go to meet the person at some point, if you say you\u2019re six-two, if you\u2019re six-one or five-eleven maybe, which then you have an incentive to say you\u2019re six feet, but if you\u2019re really five-four, that\u2019s not going to be a very good strategy. So again, it comes back to where can you build credibility. An example of this in the sports book is steroids. Any time you hear somebody say, \u201cI am not using performance-enhancing drugs,\u201d you really have no reason to believe them because the person who is and is not using them has the incentive to say exactly the same thing. So a good mechanism for getting good of cheap talk is one where you can somehow find a way to separate the cheaters from the non-cheaters or the liars from the non-liars, however you want to look at it."]},{"begin":"442.040","end":"452.200","lines":["So beyond studying online dating and cheap talk, you also chose to drive an Uber. What was that experience like, and what did you learn from it except how to get places better?"]},{"begin":"452.200","end":"509.440","lines":["You know, you don\u2019t learn how to get places better because these days [ways] [laughs] can take you anywhere you want to go. So that\u2019s not that useful from that perspective. So I\u2019m a labor economist, and in addition to writing these books, I write research papers. I\u2019ve studied lawyers. I\u2019ve studied the market for investment bankers and a bunch of other trades. And boy, I wish I could try those jobs for two weeks because you learn so much that helps structure your research questions. When we started studying Uber \u2013 and this was joint research with my Stanford colleague Rebecca Diamond and a few other people \u2013 we started studying Uber, and you can do that. The barriers to entry to being an Uber driver are so low that I just went and registered my car and tried it. And it was fascinating. Now the main benefits of it were from the research study perspective where I learned a lot about how to think about the value of experience in that context, which was really important for what we were doing."]},{"begin":"509.440","end":"549.240","lines":["But it also [laughs] just was fun. I don\u2019t want to be an Uber driver for my whole life. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019m able to work at Stanford. But I really wish I could do it both for the research side, but also it was just interesting. So at the time as I was doing that job, my stepson was working at Chipotle. And we were making about the same amount of money. And it was interesting because there\u2019s a large set of people for whom working at a job like working at Chipotle is a much better fit because they like the camaraderie and they like being told, be here at this hour, and leave at this hour. There\u2019s a larger set who need the flexibility, who like the alone time."]},{"begin":"549.240","end":"578.960","lines":["And so it\u2019s nice that there are these various options out there. And then there\u2019s just other really interesting stuff that, at least in the short term, makes driving for Uber interesting. For example, I was very lucky \u2013 I didn\u2019t do it for that long.

So a lot of what makes you successful in the job market is the macro-economic conditions at the time you\u2019re looking. I\u2019ve actually done research on this showing that people who graduate during good economic times, they have \u2013 they get benefits that last a long time.

We\u2019ll see how important it is and how well that gets backed up.

So for example, if I went in to teach Mike Spence\u2019s model that I was talking about earlier, I might start with a graph of some sort that gets at the idea in the underlying economics and tell the story of the pencil or something along those lines. And then I think just in a setting like an economics seminar in the classroom, in both those settings, I think a third ingredient would be transparently and sincerely addressing the questions and concerns that arise."]},{"begin":"956.720","end":"980.440","lines":["The goal of learning is it all comes from back and forth and, frankly, from disagreements and arguments.

No, I actually agree with everything that you said there. And you\u2019re quite consistent.
