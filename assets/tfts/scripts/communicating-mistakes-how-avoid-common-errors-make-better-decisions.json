Thank you for deciding to listen to this podcast episode. More important and relevant to our topic at hand, I want you to think about the other decisions you\u2019ve made throughout your day prior to listening. Chances are you\u2019ve made many, many decisions, some big, some small, some personal, and some business related. Today, we\u2019re going to discuss how we can make better decisions. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to \u201cThink Fast, Talk Smart \u2013 the Podcast.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am really excited today to be joined by both Jonathan Berk and Jules van Binsbergen. Jonathan is the AP Giannini Professor of Finance at the GSB. Jules is the Nippon Life Professor in Finance at Wharton. Together, Jonathan and Jules host a new podcast entitled, \u201cAll Else Equal.\u201d I\u2019ve listened in, and I\u2019ve learned a lot. Thanks for being here, Jonathan and Jules."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"It\u2019s great to be with you, Matt. Thank you so much for having us."},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Matt, it\u2019s an honor to be here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great. Let\u2019s get started. So Jonathan, you and Jules have worked together for a long while and published many papers together. I\u2019m curious, what led you to podcasting, and what is the focus of your podcast?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"In a nutshell, our podcast is about making good business decisions. We both feel that people make common mistakes repeatedly. And often, what makes this worse is they have no idea they\u2019re making a mistake. At the same time, we hear business gurus providing advice, often either flat out wrong or platitudes like, \u201cTreat your employees well.\u201d We thought we could just do better. We could provide some standard advice based on research. In fact, in each episode, we will start with a business decision that people make that they feel is obviously correct. We will explain why it is a mistake, and hopefully by the end of the episode, our listeners will think that the correct decision is obvious."},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"This might sound like a tall order, but you\u2019d be surprised how often people do things in business that are obviously wrong without realizing it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I certainly have seen a number of leaders make mistakes. And what I find so wonderful about your podcast is that you actually get people to come in and talk about their mistakes, and you help others avoid those mistakes and learn how to make better ones. So I have listened and I think it\u2019s fantastic, and I encourage everybody to listen in. Jules, given that you both are focused on helping people make better decisions, can you share a specific idea or lesson you\u2019ve learned that can help us in this area?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"So I think that when making a decision, people often have a mental model of the world that is status or fixed. But the world just doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s highly dynamic. And when I say that, I don\u2019t just mean that changes happen around us continuously that we have to somehow deal with. What I mean is, when you move a piece on your chessboard, the whole game changes. And the rest of the world who\u2019s on the other side of the chessboard will respond to that move you just made."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"So there are two ways of thinking about the chess game of life. First, think about you being allowed to make the next ten moves without the other side responding. You can win that game quite quickly, and it isn\u2019t all that hard. But now think about the other player responding after every move you make. This is a very different competitive game, and it\u2019s much harder to play that game, and you have to think very carefully about the move that you want to make. That thought process can be really frustrating. But ignoring those dynamic effects doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere. It simply is the reality we have to deal with."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"And because we think this mistake is so common and important, we decided to call the podcast \u201cAll Else Equal,\u201d because there are many statements that are true when you can hold all else equal. But in the real world, all else is never equal. And then suddenly these statements no longer hold, and they can lead you astray."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I get it. I was wondering where you got the name of your podcast. But thank you. While I\u2019m a lousy chess player, I totally understand what you mean. And I think the focus that you have and the approach you take can be really helpful. I\u2019d like to follow up though, Jules. What advice do you have on how we actually can go about communicating the mistakes we make?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Well, I\u2019d start by saying it\u2019s really hard. I think we can both agree on that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"The most important thing you need to do before communicating a mistake is thinking through what happened carefully, what in business language I think is often called do a root cause analysis. Why did that mistake happen, and what can I learn from that, because admitting mistakes is hard enough as it is, and many people will try to avoid doing so because they experience it as a humiliating thing. If you go your manager and simply admit the mistake, and then your manager asks, \u201cCan you help me understand what happened and why,\u201d you\u2019d better have a good answer. If you have the explanation as well as your plan for the future ready at that point, you can actually come out of the conversation stronger, and you can turn it into a positive experience that isn\u2019t humiliating."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it sounds to me like two things that are important there. One is approach mistakes as part of learning. There\u2019s value to be taken from the mistake so you can avoid it or do things better in the future, and then do that root cause analysis to really understand. So instead of avoiding and running from it or hiding from it, I don\u2019t know if embrace is the right word, but at least accept it and then figure out what went wrong. Is that what I heard you say?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Absolutely. But the second thing is don\u2019t follow the first mistake with a second mistake, to not come to the meeting in which you\u2019re supposed to explain the first mistake prepared. Be prepared so that you\u2019ve done the analysis before going into that meeting so that you can immediately give it a positive twist as opposed to just being a bad experience for you in which you feel bad."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, that echoes a lesson we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this podcast, which is take the time to prepare. It can really help. Jonathan, I\u2019d like to turn to you. Allow me to ask you the same question I asked Jules. Can you share a best practice for better decision making?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Well, we called the podcast \u201cAll Else Equal\u201d because we wanted to highlight a common and costly mistake that comes up in many business contexts. When you make a decision, you have to take into account the effect of that decision on the world. Too often, people ignore that. They engage in what I would call All Else Equal thinking, and they evaluate the effect of the decision holding everything else the same. You can never do that. I know it sounds obvious as I talk about it, but you\u2019d be surprised how often, in the context of a decision, people get fooled. We\u2019re going to explore many of those contexts on the show."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that is so important to understand that the environment is dynamic, and you need to be able to adjust and adapt to what\u2019s happening and not have fixed thinking. So clearly something that people can learn from you and your podcast. When I coach non-finance executives and senior leaders, they often dread and perhaps even fear their interactions with those in finance, like the CFO, for example, because they often get their proposals rejected or feel that they need to do battle. I\u2019ve heard you talk about this as a communication challenge in terms of framing and language. Can you share your thinking on this type of communication?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Yes, absolutely. So I think the first thing to establish is we think through language. If we don\u2019t speak the same language, it\u2019s very difficult to align our thoughts. So let\u2019s start with that. And for that reason, I think that one of the reasons why, regardless if [it\u2019s] they\u2019re major, a business school student should learn finance and some of the math that comes with it is that you learn the language of quantitative dynamic decision-making. How do you know whether something is a good decision unless you have properly traded off the upsides and the downsides, or what economists or finance people call benefits and costs?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"The discipline that finance brings to the table really helps with that, particularly when the costs and the benefits happen at different times. So I\u2019m not saying that everybody has to learn all the nitty-gritty details of finance, but you do need to understand, at least at a conceptual level, what goes into making a good decision and why quantities are important in that, not just qualitative arguments. Now on the other side \u2014 and that\u2019s the other side of the communication challenge \u2014 I think it\u2019s important for quantitatively oriented people to translate their insights into plain English."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"It is easy to make finance sound completely incomprehensible by using tons of jargon and acronyms, which is really unnecessary as far as I\u2019m concerned. I think a very large part of teaching, say, the core of finance class is to make people familiar with the jargon and really show them that once you translate this jargon into plain English, most of these concepts are really quite simple"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s so powerful what you said. I mean, both sides of the interaction in any communication need to speak the same language. We need to avoid jargon. We need to make sure that the terms are something that both understand. And we have to take time to learn the perspective of the other, what\u2019s important to them. I think it\u2019s fantastic that two professors of finance have said, you know what, we need to speak just in plain English to help people understand. So thank you for that."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now speaking about how we think about things, Jonathan, I know you have spent a lot of time thinking about how we think, and, even further, how we go about teaching others how to think better. What thoughts do you have on this particular topic that you can share?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Well, this is going to be an important theme of a podcast series. It\u2019s pretty easy to talk about best practices, but putting them into practice is really another matter completely."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Jonathan Berk: We\u2019re emotional creatures, and our emotions materially affect how we make decisions. For example, we learn best when we make a mistake and then recognize that we have made the mistake. But for most of us, it\u2019s really difficult to admit that we made a mistake. So an important part of teaching is understand that emotions often stand in the way of learning. Of course, I do this myself all the time; that is, I let my emotions get in the way of growing and learning. Now the best way to teach something is by modeling. So part of teaching is making sure to model the behavior. So admitting then when you make a mistake and showing students how you can learn from your own mistakes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You know, when I do make a mistake in the classroom, I\u2019m always very careful \u2014 I try to be very careful to be completely upfront about the mistake, how I made it so students can see. Nobody knows the material perfectly. And it\u2019s through the mistakes that you really get this deep understanding."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think the notion of how emotions affect us in almost everything we do is critical, especially when it comes to the way we think. And modeling is so important, and the willingness \u2014 and I really \u2014 I strive to do the same thing you do, that when a mistake is made to acknowledge it, to learn from it, and to help others feel more comfortable, not only taking the risks they need that might lead to mistakes, but when they make the mistake, to acknowledge it and learn from it. So that\u2019s really important information and I think can help us all, not only in our decision-making but in most of our interactions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Given the wide variety of topics you both teach and study, do you have any last best practices advice or frameworks you\u2019d like to impart to us?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Well, you know, I have strong views about teaching and education. I think that the way we go about educating is really an historical accident that was constrained by the technology that we had for most of human existence. But the fact is people do not learn at the same pace, nor do they learn in the same way. So our traditional way of learning where we teach everybody at the same pace and the same way I don\u2019t think is that helpful. I also don\u2019t think we learn by being lectured to. Really the way human beings learn is by doing."},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"So I\u2019ve changed in the style that I taught about a decade ago. And I guess the colloquial name for how I teach is the flipped classroom. Students do the homework and read the book before the lecture. And in the lecture, we practice by working problems. So I\u2019m trying to teach by doing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This notion of flipping the classroom, that where people do the work in advance so you can actually engage in the material in person is a great tool for teaching. But I would also argue in business settings and business meetings, the same thing applies. Instead of doing updates where all you do is recount information, have people do that on their own time in advance, so when you come together you can collaborate, discuss, and decide. So the notion of a flipped classroom, which I think is very powerful for education, I think also applies in the business world as well."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"One way to learn the quickest is by teaching."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"And so you take the flipped classroom even one step further. So in the last semester that I taught, what I did was, in the last class, I had the students teach the material to the class."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Ah. Brilliant."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"So in that way, they had to formulate in their own words what they thought the most important things were that they learned throughout the semester. And I had a very good experience with it. I would recommend it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So there\u2019s actually a teaching technique, Jules, that is based on what you just said. It\u2019s called a jigsaw, after a jigsaw puzzle, where you actually empower people to teach each other. In other words, they\u2019re each putting a piece together of the puzzle, so everybody learns from each other. And you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced this in my own life \u2014 you really learn something when you have to teach somebody else how to do it or how to think that way and empowering others to do that and, again, not just in an academic classroom setting. I think this applies to how we run meetings, how we run teams in the business world as well. So thank you for that insight."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now I know your podcast ends a little different from mine. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re willing to answer the same three questions that I ask every guest on this podcast. Are you guys up for that?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Of course."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Jonathan, if you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Keep things simple."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, I love it. And I love how simple that was. You only used three words. I gave you five to seven, and you only used three. Talk to me a little bit more of why simplicity is so important."},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"First of all, we say all complicated actually have a simple core. And if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s probably something wrong. And the other thing is people don\u2019t learn complicated concepts. It\u2019s too difficult. We only learn simple stuff. So if you think you\u2019re going to get up there and explain something very complicated to somebody and they\u2019re going to walk away and learn it, you\u2019re just fooling yourself. And obviously, simple is relative. What\u2019s simple to a theoretical physicist \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"\u2014 [isn\u2019t] simple to me. But at every level, you have to keep it simple."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"If I can add to that, so I think it\u2019s important also for groups to set a culture where simplicity is rewarded. I think that there\u2019re certain settings where overcomplicating things, people think that it makes them sound intelligent and makes them look better. But I think in the end, nobody\u2019s helped with that approach."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I absolutely appreciate what you both are saying. And I think it\u2019s really cool that you think this way, too, because if you can simplify something \u2014 and to me, I like to use the word accessible maybe more than simplify, but if you can make something accessible, take it down to the most basic elements, you can really help people learn. And what it requires from your perspective is you really have to think through what the other person knows and needs in order to get it to that simplified, accessible point. So it\u2019s not just about saying it as simply as possible. It\u2019s really about the thought process beforehand that helps you do that. So I love keep it simple."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now let me ask both of you this question: Who is a communicator that you admire, and why? And Jules, why don\u2019t you go first?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"My favorite communicator is Keith Jarrett, who is one of the best jazz pianists in the world."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Huh."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"And he doesn\u2019t even need words to do it. I think that there are things that music and particularly improvisation can communicate that no other language can communicate."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am a huge fan of improvisation. We\u2019ve spent a few episodes talking to experts on improv, and I think you\u2019re right. Those who have the ability to put things together in the moment can communicate in ways that are just fantastic to participate in as an audience. And be it spoken or playing the piano, it\u2019s fantastic. Jonathan, I\u2019m curious, whom do you admire and why?"},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Well, I mean, I wish I had as great an answer as Jules. I mean, I think Michael Lewis is a phenomenal communicator. I think he can take pretty complicated concepts and make them very simple and communicate them very effectively."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Jules, our final question for you: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"So I would say the first ingredient to effective communication is listening. So unless you have at least some basic understanding of what the person you\u2019re talking to is thinking or often, particularly in the educational setting, struggling with, what you\u2019re going to say is not going to arrive. So you first have to figure out what is going on in the head of the other person. So that\u2019s ingredient one. I would say the second ingredient is the one we just mentioned, which is simplicity. I think that there are certain academic fields that seem to go out of their way to say things in the most complicated way possible."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"And I think this just serves as a barrier to entry for people not belonging to the in-crowd. But in the end, it doesn\u2019t help either the people in the out-crowd, but also even the people in the in-crowd are not helped because, if you want to get new ideas, new ideas are very rare. And to get new ideas, you need a lot of people to engage in the conversation, particularly qualified people. So why would you put up barriers to entry, particularly in language, to keep people out. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s effective."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"And then finally, the third ingredient, I would say, is also, again in an educational setting, is humility. And what I mean with that is in the end, I think it\u2019s important to take yourself out of the equation in the sense that, in the end, the only measure of success that you have as an educator is how much more do students know, or have learned, is even a better way than just knowing, have learned at the end of your course. The rest is irrelevant."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The idea of listening and being clear, accessible, and simple \u2014 very, very important. But the last point about humility, I think, is fundamental. And not only is it in education, but just I think in all communication, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about the people you\u2019re speaking to and what they can do with the information you\u2019re providing. And that understanding is really critical. You know, Jonathan and Jules, I knew this was going to be fun and exciting. Thank you so much. You\u2019ve provided us with so many insights and so many ideas to help us make better decisions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I encourage everyone listening to listen in to their podcast, \u201cAll Else Equal.\u201d Best of luck to both of you, and congratulations."},{"author":"Jules van Binsbergen","text":"Thanks so much, Matt."},{"author":"Jonathan Berk","text":"Thank you very much, Matt.

I\u2019m curious, what led you to podcasting, and what is the focus of your podcast?"]},{"begin":"88.800","end":"134.120","lines":["In a nutshell, our podcast is about making good business decisions. We both feel that people make common mistakes repeatedly. And often, what makes this worse is they have no idea they\u2019re making a mistake. At the same time, we hear business gurus providing advice, often either flat out wrong or platitudes like, \u201cTreat your employees well.\u201d We thought we could just do better. We could provide some standard advice based on research. In fact, in each episode, we will start with a business decision that people make that they feel is obviously correct. We will explain why it is a mistake, and hopefully by the end of the episode, our listeners will think that the correct decision is obvious."]},{"begin":"134.120","end":"142.840","lines":["This might sound like a tall order, but you\u2019d be surprised how often people do things in business that are obviously wrong without realizing it."]},{"begin":"142.840","end":"169.960","lines":["Well, I certainly have seen a number of leaders make mistakes. And what I find so wonderful about your podcast is that you actually get people to come in and talk about their mistakes, and you help others avoid those mistakes and learn how to make better ones. So I have listened and I think it\u2019s fantastic, and I encourage everybody to listen in. Jules, given that you both are focused on helping people make better decisions, can you share a specific idea or lesson you\u2019ve learned that can help us in this area?"]},{"begin":"169.960","end":"196.800","lines":["So I think that when making a decision, people often have a mental model of the world that is status or fixed. But the world just doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s highly dynamic. And when I say that, I don\u2019t just mean that changes happen around us continuously that we have to somehow deal with. What I mean is, when you move a piece on your chessboard, the whole game changes. And the rest of the world who\u2019s on the other side of the chessboard will respond to that move you just made."]},{"begin":"196.800","end":"228.560","lines":["So there are two ways of thinking about the chess game of life. First, think about you being allowed to make the next ten moves without the other side responding. You can win that game quite quickly, and it isn\u2019t all that hard. But now think about the other player responding after every move you make. This is a very different competitive game, and it\u2019s much harder to play that game, and you have to think very carefully about the move that you want to make. That thought process can be really frustrating. But ignoring those dynamic effects doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere. It simply is the reality we have to deal with."]},{"begin":"228.560","end":"245.200","lines":["And because we think this mistake is so common and important, we decided to call the podcast \u201cAll Else Equal,\u201d because there are many statements that are true when you can hold all else equal. But in the real world, all else is never equal. And then suddenly these statements no longer hold, and they can lead you astray."]},{"begin":"245.200","end":"264.800","lines":["I get it. I was wondering where you got the name of your podcast. But thank you. While I\u2019m a lousy chess player, I totally understand what you mean. And I think the focus that you have and the approach you take can be really helpful. I\u2019d like to follow up though, Jules. What advice do you have on how we actually can go about communicating the mistakes we make?"]},{"begin":"264.800","end":"268.560","lines":["Well, I\u2019d start by saying it\u2019s really hard. I think we can both agree on that."]},{"begin":"268.560","end":"269.640","lines":["Yeah, absolutely."]},{"begin":"269.640","end":"310.200","lines":["The most important thing you need to do before communicating a mistake is thinking through what happened carefully, what in business language I think is often called do a root cause analysis. Why did that mistake happen, and what can I learn from that, because admitting mistakes is hard enough as it is, and many people will try to avoid doing so because they experience it as a humiliating thing. If you go your manager and simply admit the mistake, and then your manager asks, \u201cCan you help me understand what happened and why,\u201d you\u2019d better have a good answer. If you have the explanation as well as your plan for the future ready at that point, you can actually come out of the conversation stronger, and you can turn it into a positive experience that isn\u2019t humiliating."]},{"begin":"310.200","end":"331.680","lines":["So it sounds to me like two things that are important there. One is approach mistakes as part of learning. There\u2019s value to be taken from the mistake so you can avoid it or do things better in the future, and then do that root cause analysis to really understand. So instead of avoiding and running from it or hiding from it, I don\u2019t know if embrace is the right word, but at least accept it and then figure out what went wrong. Is that what I heard you say?"]},{"begin":"331.680","end":"352.000","lines":["Absolutely. But the second thing is don\u2019t follow the first mistake with a second mistake, to not come to the meeting in which you\u2019re supposed to explain the first mistake prepared. Be prepared so that you\u2019ve done the analysis before going into that meeting so that you can immediately give it a positive twist as opposed to just being a bad experience for you in which you feel bad."]},{"begin":"352.000","end":"365.320","lines":["Well, that echoes a lesson we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this podcast, which is take the time to prepare. It can really help. Jonathan, I\u2019d like to turn to you. Allow me to ask you the same question I asked Jules. Can you share a best practice for better decision making?"]},{"begin":"365.320","end":"404.160","lines":["Well, we called the podcast \u201cAll Else Equal\u201d because we wanted to highlight a common and costly mistake that comes up in many business contexts. When you make a decision, you have to take into account the effect of that decision on the world. Too often, people ignore that. They engage in what I would call All Else Equal thinking, and they evaluate the effect of the decision holding everything else the same. You can never do that. I know it sounds obvious as I talk about it, but you\u2019d be surprised how often, in the context of a decision, people get fooled. We\u2019re going to explore many of those contexts on the show."]},{"begin":"404.160","end":"444.040","lines":["I think that is so important to understand that the environment is dynamic, and you need to be able to adjust and adapt to what\u2019s happening and not have fixed thinking. So clearly something that people can learn from you and your podcast. When I coach non-finance executives and senior leaders, they often dread and perhaps even fear their interactions with those in finance, like the CFO, for example, because they often get their proposals rejected or feel that they need to do battle. I\u2019ve heard you talk about this as a communication challenge in terms of framing and language. Can you share your thinking on this type of communication?"]},{"begin":"444.040","end":"478.400","lines":["Yes, absolutely. So I think the first thing to establish is we think through language. If we don\u2019t speak the same language, it\u2019s very difficult to align our thoughts. So let\u2019s start with that. And for that reason, I think that one of the reasons why, regardless if [it\u2019s] they\u2019re major, a business school student should learn finance and some of the math that comes with it is that you learn the language of quantitative dynamic decision-making. How do you know whether something is a good decision unless you have properly traded off the upsides and the downsides, or what economists or finance people call benefits and costs?"]},{"begin":"478.400","end":"507.000","lines":["The discipline that finance brings to the table really helps with that, particularly when the costs and the benefits happen at different times. So I\u2019m not saying that everybody has to learn all the nitty-gritty details of finance, but you do need to understand, at least at a conceptual level, what goes into making a good decision and why quantities are important in that, not just qualitative arguments. Now on the other side \u2014 and that\u2019s the other side of the communication challenge \u2014 I think it\u2019s important for quantitatively oriented people to translate their insights into plain English."]},{"begin":"507.000","end":"528.960","lines":["It is easy to make finance sound completely incomprehensible by using tons of jargon and acronyms, which is really unnecessary as far as I\u2019m concerned. I think a very large part of teaching, say, the core of finance class is to make people familiar with the jargon and really show them that once you translate this jargon into plain English, most of these concepts are really quite simple"]},{"begin":"528.960","end":"556.760","lines":["That\u2019s so powerful what you said. I mean, both sides of the interaction in any communication need to speak the same language. We need to avoid jargon. We need to make sure that the terms are something that both understand. And we have to take time to learn the perspective of the other, what\u2019s important to them. I think it\u2019s fantastic that two professors of finance have said, you know what, we need to speak just in plain English to help people understand. So thank you for that."]},{"begin":"556.760","end":"557.440","lines":["Thank you."]},{"begin":"557.440","end":"574.800","lines":["Now speaking about how we think about things, Jonathan, I know you have spent a lot of time thinking about how we think, and, even further, how we go about teaching others how to think better. What thoughts do you have on this particular topic that you can share?"]},{"begin":"574.800","end":"585.120","lines":["Well, this is going to be an important theme of a podcast series. It\u2019s pretty easy to talk about best practices, but putting them into practice is really another matter completely."]},{"begin":"585.120","end":"585.760","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"585.760","end":"629.440","lines":["Jonathan Berk: We\u2019re emotional creatures, and our emotions materially affect how we make decisions. For example, we learn best when we make a mistake and then recognize that we have made the mistake. But for most of us, it\u2019s really difficult to admit that we made a mistake. So an important part of teaching is understand that emotions often stand in the way of learning. Of course, I do this myself all the time; that is, I let my emotions get in the way of growing and learning. Now the best way to teach something is by modeling. So part of teaching is making sure to model the behavior. So admitting then when you make a mistake and showing students how you can learn from your own mistakes."]},{"begin":"629.440","end":"648.840","lines":["You know, when I do make a mistake in the classroom, I\u2019m always very careful \u2014 I try to be very careful to be completely upfront about the mistake, how I made it so students can see. Nobody knows the material perfectly. And it\u2019s through the mistakes that you really get this deep understanding."]},{"begin":"648.840","end":"684.560","lines":["I think the notion of how emotions affect us in almost everything we do is critical, especially when it comes to the way we think. And modeling is so important, and the willingness \u2014 and I really \u2014 I strive to do the same thing you do, that when a mistake is made to acknowledge it, to learn from it, and to help others feel more comfortable, not only taking the risks they need that might lead to mistakes, but when they make the mistake, to acknowledge it and learn from it. So that\u2019s really important information and I think can help us all, not only in our decision-making but in most of our interactions."]},{"begin":"684.560","end":"693.720","lines":["Given the wide variety of topics you both teach and study, do you have any last best practices advice or frameworks you\u2019d like to impart to us?"]},{"begin":"693.720","end":"723.520","lines":["Well, you know, I have strong views about teaching and education. I think that the way we go about educating is really an historical accident that was constrained by the technology that we had for most of human existence. But the fact is people do not learn at the same pace, nor do they learn in the same way. So our traditional way of learning where we teach everybody at the same pace and the same way I don\u2019t think is that helpful. I also don\u2019t think we learn by being lectured to. Really the way human beings learn is by doing."]},{"begin":"723.520","end":"743.680","lines":["So I\u2019ve changed in the style that I taught about a decade ago. And I guess the colloquial name for how I teach is the flipped classroom. Students do the homework and read the book before the lecture. And in the lecture, we practice by working problems. So I\u2019m trying to teach by doing."]},{"begin":"743.680","end":"777.320","lines":["This notion of flipping the classroom, that where people do the work in advance so you can actually engage in the material in person is a great tool for teaching. But I would also argue in business settings and business meetings, the same thing applies. Instead of doing updates where all you do is recount information, have people do that on their own time in advance, so when you come together you can collaborate, discuss, and decide. So the notion of a flipped classroom, which I think is very powerful for education, I think also applies in the business world as well."]},{"begin":"777.320","end":"781.560","lines":["One way to learn the quickest is by teaching."]},{"begin":"781.560","end":"782.680","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"782.680","end":"793.520","lines":["And so you take the flipped classroom even one step further. So in the last semester that I taught, what I did was, in the last class, I had the students teach the material to the class."]},{"begin":"793.520","end":"794.600","lines":["Ah. Brilliant."]},{"begin":"794.600","end":"805.840","lines":["So in that way, they had to formulate in their own words what they thought the most important things were that they learned throughout the semester. And I had a very good experience with it. I would recommend it."]},{"begin":"805.840","end":"840.400","lines":["So there\u2019s actually a teaching technique, Jules, that is based on what you just said. It\u2019s called a jigsaw, after a jigsaw puzzle, where you actually empower people to teach each other. In other words, they\u2019re each putting a piece together of the puzzle, so everybody learns from each other. And you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced this in my own life \u2014 you really learn something when you have to teach somebody else how to do it or how to think that way and empowering others to do that and, again, not just in an academic classroom setting. I think this applies to how we run meetings, how we run teams in the business world as well. So thank you for that insight."]},{"begin":"840.400","end":"849.960","lines":["Now I know your podcast ends a little different from mine. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re willing to answer the same three questions that I ask every guest on this podcast. Are you guys up for that?"]},{"begin":"849.960","end":"850.720","lines":["Of course."]},{"begin":"850.720","end":"862.280","lines":["So Jonathan, if you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"862.280","end":"864.720","lines":["Keep things simple."]},{"begin":"864.720","end":"873.640","lines":["Oh, I love it. And I love how simple that was. You only used three words. I gave you five to seven, and you only used three. Talk to me a little bit more of why simplicity is so important."]},{"begin":"873.640","end":"901.440","lines":["First of all, we say all complicated actually have a simple core. And if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s probably something wrong. And the other thing is people don\u2019t learn complicated concepts. It\u2019s too difficult. We only learn simple stuff. So if you think you\u2019re going to get up there and explain something very complicated to somebody and they\u2019re going to walk away and learn it, you\u2019re just fooling yourself. And obviously, simple is relative. What\u2019s simple to a theoretical physicist \u2014"]},{"begin":"901.440","end":"901.960","lines":["[Laughs]"]},{"begin":"901.960","end":"906.560","lines":["\u2014 [isn\u2019t] simple to me. But at every level, you have to keep it simple."]},{"begin":"906.560","end":"926.080","lines":["If I can add to that, so I think it\u2019s important also for groups to set a culture where simplicity is rewarded. I think that there\u2019re certain settings where overcomplicating things, people think that it makes them sound intelligent and makes them look better. But I think in the end, nobody\u2019s helped with that approach."]},{"begin":"926.080","end":"968.040","lines":["I absolutely appreciate what you both are saying. And I think it\u2019s really cool that you think this way, too, because if you can simplify something \u2014 and to me, I like to use the word accessible maybe more than simplify, but if you can make something accessible, take it down to the most basic elements, you can really help people learn. And what it requires from your perspective is you really have to think through what the other person knows and needs in order to get it to that simplified, accessible point. So it\u2019s not just about saying it as simply as possible. It\u2019s really about the thought process beforehand that helps you do that. So I love keep it simple."]},{"begin":"968.040","end":"975.120","lines":["Now let me ask both of you this question: Who is a communicator that you admire, and why? And Jules, why don\u2019t you go first?"]},{"begin":"975.120","end":"980.120","lines":["My favorite communicator is Keith Jarrett, who is one of the best jazz pianists in the world."]},{"begin":"980.120","end":"980.720","lines":["Huh."]},{"begin":"980.720","end":"990.240","lines":["And he doesn\u2019t even need words to do it. I think that there are things that music and particularly improvisation can communicate that no other language can communicate."]},{"begin":"990.240","end":"1012.080","lines":["I am a huge fan of improvisation. We\u2019ve spent a few episodes talking to experts on improv, and I think you\u2019re right. Those who have the ability to put things together in the moment can communicate in ways that are just fantastic to participate in as an audience. And be it spoken or playing the piano, it\u2019s fantastic. Jonathan, I\u2019m curious, whom do you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1012.080","end":"1026.480","lines":["Well, I mean, I wish I had as great an answer as Jules. I mean, I think Michael Lewis is a phenomenal communicator. I think he can take pretty complicated concepts and make them very simple and communicate them very effectively."]},{"begin":"1026.480","end":"1035.200","lines":["Jules, our final question for you: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1035.200","end":"1067.920","lines":["So I would say the first ingredient to effective communication is listening. So unless you have at least some basic understanding of what the person you\u2019re talking to is thinking or often, particularly in the educational setting, struggling with, what you\u2019re going to say is not going to arrive. So you first have to figure out what is going on in the head of the other person. So that\u2019s ingredient one. I would say the second ingredient is the one we just mentioned, which is simplicity. I think that there are certain academic fields that seem to go out of their way to say things in the most complicated way possible."]},{"begin":"1067.920","end":"1095.360","lines":["And I think this just serves as a barrier to entry for people not belonging to the in-crowd. But in the end, it doesn\u2019t help either the people in the out-crowd, but also even the people in the in-crowd are not helped because, if you want to get new ideas, new ideas are very rare. And to get new ideas, you need a lot of people to engage in the conversation, particularly qualified people. So why would you put up barriers to entry, particularly in language, to keep people out. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s effective."]},{"begin":"1095.360","end":"1121.520","lines":["And then finally, the third ingredient, I would say, is also, again in an educational setting, is humility. And what I mean with that is in the end, I think it\u2019s important to take yourself out of the equation in the sense that, in the end, the only measure of success that you have as an educator is how much more do students know, or have learned, is even a better way than just knowing, have learned at the end of your course. The rest is irrelevant."]},{"begin":"1121.520","end":"1157.680","lines":["The idea of listening and being clear, accessible, and simple \u2014 very, very important. But the last point about humility, I think, is fundamental. And not only is it in education, but just I think in all communication, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about the people you\u2019re speaking to and what they can do with the information you\u2019re providing. And that understanding is really critical. You know, Jonathan and Jules, I knew this was going to be fun and exciting. Thank you so much. You\u2019ve provided us with so many insights and so many ideas to help us make better decisions."]},{"begin":"1157.680","end":"1165.920","lines":["I encourage everyone listening to listen in to their podcast, \u201cAll Else Equal.\u201d Best of luck to both of you, and congratulations."]},{"begin":"1165.920","end":"1167.040","lines":["Thanks so much, Matt."]},{"begin":"1167.040","end":"1171.040","lines":["Thank you very much, Matt.
