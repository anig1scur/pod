Your palms are sweaty. Your heart is pounding. Your legs are shaking. If you\u2019re like most of us, this is what you experience when you\u2019re about to speak publicly. Research tells us that 85% of people feel nervous in high-stake speaking situations. And quite frankly, I think the other 15% are lying."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"In this episode we\u2019re going to explore specific techniques you can use to manage both your symptoms and sources of anxiety so you can feel more comfortable and confident when communicating in front of others."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today we\u2019re going to mix things up a bit, and rather than having me ask the questions, I\u2019m going to slide over and sit in the other chair so I can answer questions about communication apprehension. This means we need someone to step in and host. And luckily we found the perfect person."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Allow me to introduce Jenny Luna. She\u2019s our executive producer of Think Fast, Talk Smart and an all-around amazing person. Hi, Jenny. I\u2019m really excited to have you here to share your thoughts and questions about speaking anxiety."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Hey, Matt. I\u2019m really excited to be here. You know, I was asked to give a toast at a friend\u2019s wedding recently."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"And I was so nervous up until the reception, I didn\u2019t even get to enjoy the event."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, I\u2019m sorry."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"And since we\u2019ve been working on this podcast, I\u2019m excited to think about how I can look at my anxiety, especially in just little situations like team meetings or one-on-one with my supervisor and how I can get rid of that anxiousness."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I got bad news for you. I don\u2019t know that we can ever truly get rid of it. But certainly we can learn to manage it so that it doesn\u2019t manage us."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Awesome. Okay, well, I\u2019ve got questions for you, so let\u2019s jump in."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. I\u2019m ready."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"You\u2019re an expert on helping people feel more confident and less anxious when they communicate. How did you get interested in this?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You know, there are very few people I know who can point to one event in their life that put their life on a specific trajectory in terms of the work they do. But for me, one morning when I was 14 years old, it all comes down to that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I was a freshman in high school. The very first day, Mr. Meredith, our English teacher, had all of us stand up and give a real quick speech about ourselves. Since my last name is Abrahams, I went first. And after I was done, he came up to me and said, \u201cMatt, you\u2019re really good at this speaking thing. You got to go to this speech competition this coming Saturday.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So I woke up super early. I\u2019d spent a little bit of time putting a speech together. I show up. It\u2019s foggy. It\u2019s cold. The room is full of other students, parents of my friends who are supposed to judge this thing. The girl I like is sitting in the room. And I\u2019m about to give my speech. And the nerves were just coursing through my body, totally freaked out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am giving a presentation on karate, because I was told to do something that is important to me, and I was and still am interested in martial arts. I was so nervous, I forgot to put on my special karate pants. So you can tell where this is going, Jenny."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Oh, no."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The first 10 seconds of my 10-minute speech, I start with a karate kick to get people\u2019s attention. I ripped my pants from belt buckle to zipper. And in that moment, I learned the impact anxiety can have on people when they speak. And from that moment on, I\u2019ve dedicated my life to trying to understand what that anxiety is all about and how to help people feel better and more comfortable when they speak."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Oh. That is, like, a teen\u2019s worst nightmare."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It was pretty, pretty bad. I still wake up sometimes dreading that moment."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Oh, wow. Well, you\u2019ve written a book and your TEDx talk is called Speaking Up Without Freaking Out. So I have to ask you, Do you still freak out when you speak up?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I wish I could say I don\u2019t, but, in fact, I do. It\u2019s very normal and natural for people to feel nervous. Now, thankfully, after years of working on my anxiety, I feel much more confident."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But there\u2019s one time every year that I get super nervous. There is a convention of professors of communication who teach at business schools. And whenever I have to present in front of these folks, I get super nervous. And, by the way, Jenny, if you ever want to see really bad presenting, you should watch a group of professors of communication present to each other. We don\u2019t do a very good job of it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But, yes, I still do get nervous in certain situations. But I\u2019ve learned techniques to manage that anxiety. And I know you\u2019re going to ask me some questions about those techniques, and I\u2019m happy to share with others so they can feel less nervous."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"And why is anxiety so pervasive? We know what we\u2019re going to say. Oftentimes we know who we\u2019re speaking to. Why do we get anxious?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So many of us who study this believe it\u2019s evolutionary. It\u2019s part of being human. It goes back to when our species was evolving. We would hang out in groups of about 150 people. And your relative status in that group meant a lot."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And when I\u2019m talking about status, I\u2019m not talking about who drives the fancy car or who gets more likes on their videos. I\u2019m talking about your position in a hierarchy where the higher the status you had, the more access you got to things like food and shelter and reproduction. And if you were low status, that meant your life was in jeopardy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So anything that puts your status at risk should make you nervous. And that\u2019s ingrained in us. And we see speaking anxiety in all cultures. It tends to develop when children become teenagers, which is when we become much more socially aware and part of a culture. So a lot of people believe this is ingrained in who we are, and we just have to learn to manage it."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"That\u2019s fascinating. I had no idea it went so far back in being human."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. It is part of our condition."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"So let\u2019s get into the nitty-gritty and talk about how we can actually manage this anxiety when we\u2019re speaking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. And there are lots of ways to do it. There are many academically verified techniques. When we look at managing anxiety, I like to break it up into two different buckets. There are the symptoms that we experience as well as the sources of anxiety."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So we need to focus on both to become more confident. The symptoms are what we experience. The sources are what make our anxiety even worse."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Mmm, interesting. So your thing is kind of holding a cold bottle of water. I\u2019ve seen you do it. I\u2019ve heard people refer to this. Can you tell me more about that?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So when I get nervous, the big thing that happens to me is I perspire and I blush. And this is a very normal symptomatic response to anxiety. When you get nervous, your heartbeat goes up, your body constricts so your blood pressure goes up. And this drives up your core body temperature. It\u2019s like you\u2019re working out, you\u2019re exercising."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So holding a cold bottle of water in the palm of your hand actually can cool you down. Your palms, just like your forehead when you have a fever, are thermo-regulators for your body. So holding something cold can reduce your core body temperature."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m sure on a cold day, Jenny, you\u2019ve seen this work in reverse. If you\u2019ve ever held warm coffee or tea, you\u2019ve felt how it warms you up. Holding a cold bottle of water can cool you down. So I do that religiously."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"There are other types of techniques we can use to manage our symptoms. So if you\u2019re somebody who shakes a lot, doing big, broad gestures or moving when you speak can give that adrenaline a place to go. If you\u2019re somebody who gets dry mouth, drinking something warm or sucking on a lozenge or chewing gum \u2014 before you speak, not while \u2014 can help reverse those symptoms."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So the bottom line is there are things we can do to manage the symptoms. And by far the most important is taking a deep breath. By taking a deep belly breath, like you\u2019re doing yoga or tai chi or qi gong, it really slows down your heart rate, which is the impetus and initiator of many of the anxiety symptoms that we find. So things we can do to manage our symptoms absolutely exist."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"I love those. They\u2019re really practical tools that I can use: deep breath, cold bottle of water, just really kind of centering in the moment. I\u2019m going to use the big-gesture thing, too."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Another source of anxiety that makes people really nervous is their fear of what might happen in the future. So my students are afraid they might not get a good grade. The entrepreneurs I coach, they\u2019re afraid that they might not get the funding or support that they need. You might be concerned that your idea isn\u2019t supported and acted upon."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Those are fears that come from a future state, a potential negative future outcome. So the way to short-circuit that is to become present-oriented. If you\u2019re in the moment, you can\u2019t be worried about the future, by definition."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So how do you get present-oriented? Many things you can do. I like to do something physical. Maybe walk around the building. I love to shake hands with people before I speak, because I have to engage with them. I can\u2019t be thinking about all these things that could go wrong if I\u2019m asking somebody how they\u2019re doing. You can do what athletes do. Listen to a song or a playlist. That can get you present-oriented. I often encourage my students to start at 100 and count backwards by 17s. You can\u2019t do that without being in the present moment."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And finally\u2013and this is a little silly, Jenny\u2013my favorite way of getting present-oriented is to say tongue twisters. You can\u2019t say a tongue twister right and not be in the present moment. So before I ever give a presentation or contribute to a meeting where I\u2019m really nervous, I\u2019ll be holding a bottle of water, standing in the corner saying a tongue twister. Nobody sees me do it, and it gets me in the right place to be able to communicate confidently."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Those things probably feel silly when you\u2019re doing them, but I imagine they\u2019re well worth it if it\u2019s going to help you get through a presentation confidently."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019re exactly right. Not only does it sometimes feel silly, but it also gives you a sense of agency. You feel like you can do something in the situation where you feel nervous. Many people just feel like they\u2019re swept away by their anxiety. And this actually gives you something to do that helps you feel better."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Cool. Well, there\u2019s something else I\u2019ve been wanting to ask your advice on, going back to this toast that I had to give at a friend\u2019s wedding. My biggest fear when I got up there and I had the microphone was that I was going to completely blank out, and I was going to forget everything I had prepared."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"So what do you say to that?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That is, by far, the number-one fear I hear from people when I do the work I do is I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to blank out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And blanking out can happen. If you really think about it, the likelihood of totally blanking out is pretty low. So just doing that rationalization can help."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"There are three things I want to suggest about blanking out. First, a great way to avoid blanking out is to take time to really map out your content. I\u2019m not saying word-for-word memorize. Memorizing actually can work against you. It can make you more nervous. But if you have a map, a structure, that can help."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now, if you\u2019re in the moment and you blank out, two bits of advice. First, just like if you were to lose your keys, go back to go forward. Even if we can\u2019t remember what we want to say next, we typically can remember what we just said. And simply by repeating what you just said, it will often get you back on track. And some people feel like, oh, that\u2019s going to be weird to repeat what I just said, but, in fact, your audience benefits from you repeating things."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So the first thing to do if you blank out in the moment is to repeat what you just said. The second thing: In advance of speaking, always have what I call a back-pocket question, a question you can pull out to ask your audience to get them engaged in something else so you can collect your thoughts."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So I\u2019m going to let you in on a little secret. And if any of my former students are listening, you\u2019re going to learn something that you saw play out in class, but you didn\u2019t know was a trick I was using."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"There are times when I am lecturing, where I\u2019ll forget what I need to say next. So I have a back-pocket question. I will simply stop when I blank out, and I\u2019ll ask my students to think about how what we just covered could be applied to their life."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And when I do that, my students actually just take a moment to think. Some of them have told me it\u2019s really helpful, because they\u2019re really applying this stuff. What\u2019s happening in the background is in my head, I\u2019m, like, oh, my goodness, what do I need to say next? I\u2019m buying myself some time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So all of us in our communication can think of a question or two that we could ask in most places in what we\u2019re speaking about to get our audience to think about something so we can buy ourselves time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So by simply knowing things you can do in advance and during blanking out, it actually reduces the likelihood you\u2019ll blank out, because we get so nervous about blanking out, it makes blanking out more likely. So having those things at the ready can really help."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"It\u2019s so great to hear that even though you\u2019re an expert in communication, you still blank out, and you have all these little techniques. It\u2019s not so black and white, whether you\u2019re good at speaking or not good at speaking. It\u2019s about using those techniques to really rise above."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019re absolutely right. I think everyone can learn to manage their anxiety. And it is so important to do. So many people have important things to contribute at their work and their personal lives, in public discourse. And if anxiety is getting in the way, we need to do something about it."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"So like you always do, I\u2019m going to ask you the same three questions at the end of this episode. And I\u2019m really curious to hear your answers \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Uh-oh."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"\u2014 because I\u2019ve heard you ask so many people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Uh-oh. All right. I\u2019m ready. Bring it."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"If you were to capture the best communication advice you\u2019ve ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide, what would it be?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So I mentioned this before on an earlier podcast, when Lauren Weinstein and I were talking. But this, I think, is really critical. \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And the reason this is so powerful is it contains so many important bits of advice. First, be concise. Be clear. Be focused. And in order to be concise and clear and focused, you have to know who you\u2019re speaking to. So you have to reflect on who\u2019s my audience."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So in that statement \u2014 and I heard that first from my mother years and years ago \u2014 \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build the clock.\u201d It really focuses us on the key elements of what I think it takes to be successful in your communication."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"And who is a communicator that you most admire and why?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This is so hard. I used to say any of the amazingly brave young students who survived the Parkland shooting in Florida. I was so in awe of their ability to communicate. And I still am."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But I recently heard an amazing TED talk on the topic of confidence by a young woman named Brittany Packnett. And her presentation just floored me, not just because the topic is near and dear to my heart regarding confidence, but her execution of the communication was phenomenal."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Did you notice how I snuck in a couple things there, Jenny? So I gave you two, not just one."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"I\u2019m going to have to look up that TED talk. And finally, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. So I did a lot of work looking into this. When my business partner and I formed our consulting practice about 10 years ago, we scoured the literature to try to find what are the essential ingredients to successful communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And we came down to three, and we call them the three Cs. The three Cs are being confident, being connected \u2014 that is, making your content relevant, being present with your audience \u2014 and then finally being compelling. There are lots of ways to say things, but if you can say things in a compelling way that touch people, that are vivid, that use emotion, it can really, really help."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it\u2019s about confidence, connection, and being compelling."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Awesome. Thank you so much. I\u2019ve learned a lot, and I\u2019m kind of ready to go out and give another toast or speech now with all these skills."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I hope you do. And thank you so much for asking these important questions. And you\u2019re a pretty darn good host. I got a lot I could learn from you. Thanks for sitting in the hosting chair."},{"author":"Jenny Luna","text":"Thanks,

You know, I was asked to give a toast at a friend\u2019s wedding recently."]},{"begin":"83.640","end":"84.440","lines":["Oh."]},{"begin":"84.440","end":"89.160","lines":["And I was so nervous up until the reception, I didn\u2019t even get to enjoy the event."]},{"begin":"89.160","end":"90.440","lines":["Oh, I\u2019m sorry."]},{"begin":"90.440","end":"104.800","lines":["And since we\u2019ve been working on this podcast, I\u2019m excited to think about how I can look at my anxiety, especially in just little situations like team meetings or one-on-one with my supervisor and how I can get rid of that anxiousness."]},{"begin":"104.800","end":"114.160","lines":["Well, I got bad news for you. I don\u2019t know that we can ever truly get rid of it. But certainly we can learn to manage it so that it doesn\u2019t manage us."]},{"begin":"114.160","end":"117.160","lines":["Awesome. Okay, well, I\u2019ve got questions for you, so let\u2019s jump in."]},{"begin":"117.160","end":"119.040","lines":["All right. I\u2019m ready."]},{"begin":"119.040","end":"126.160","lines":["You\u2019re an expert on helping people feel more confident and less anxious when they communicate. How did you get interested in this?"]},{"begin":"126.160","end":"141.000","lines":["You know, there are very few people I know who can point to one event in their life that put their life on a specific trajectory in terms of the work they do. But for me, one morning when I was 14 years old, it all comes down to that."]},{"begin":"141.000","end":"161.440","lines":["I was a freshman in high school. The very first day, Mr. Meredith, our English teacher, had all of us stand up and give a real quick speech about ourselves. Since my last name is Abrahams, I went first. And after I was done, he came up to me and said, \u201cMatt, you\u2019re really good at this speaking thing. You got to go to this speech competition this coming Saturday.\u201d"]},{"begin":"161.440","end":"182.280","lines":["So I woke up super early. I\u2019d spent a little bit of time putting a speech together. I show up. It\u2019s foggy. It\u2019s cold. The room is full of other students, parents of my friends who are supposed to judge this thing. The girl I like is sitting in the room. And I\u2019m about to give my speech. And the nerves were just coursing through my body, totally freaked out."]},{"begin":"182.280","end":"196.640","lines":["I am giving a presentation on karate, because I was told to do something that is important to me, and I was and still am interested in martial arts. I was so nervous, I forgot to put on my special karate pants. So you can tell where this is going, Jenny."]},{"begin":"196.640","end":"197.520","lines":["Oh, no."]},{"begin":"197.520","end":"221.400","lines":["The first 10 seconds of my 10-minute speech, I start with a karate kick to get people\u2019s attention. I ripped my pants from belt buckle to zipper. And in that moment, I learned the impact anxiety can have on people when they speak. And from that moment on, I\u2019ve dedicated my life to trying to understand what that anxiety is all about and how to help people feel better and more comfortable when they speak."]},{"begin":"221.400","end":"224.520","lines":["Oh. That is, like, a teen\u2019s worst nightmare."]},{"begin":"224.520","end":"229.960","lines":["It was pretty, pretty bad. I still wake up sometimes dreading that moment."]},{"begin":"229.960","end":"240.200","lines":["Oh, wow. Well, you\u2019ve written a book and your TEDx talk is called Speaking Up Without Freaking Out. So I have to ask you, Do you still freak out when you speak up?"]},{"begin":"240.200","end":"250.880","lines":["I wish I could say I don\u2019t, but, in fact, I do. It\u2019s very normal and natural for people to feel nervous. Now, thankfully, after years of working on my anxiety, I feel much more confident."]},{"begin":"250.880","end":"273.040","lines":["But there\u2019s one time every year that I get super nervous. There is a convention of professors of communication who teach at business schools. And whenever I have to present in front of these folks, I get super nervous. And, by the way, Jenny, if you ever want to see really bad presenting, you should watch a group of professors of communication present to each other. We don\u2019t do a very good job of it."]},{"begin":"273.040","end":"286.520","lines":["But, yes, I still do get nervous in certain situations. But I\u2019ve learned techniques to manage that anxiety. And I know you\u2019re going to ask me some questions about those techniques, and I\u2019m happy to share with others so they can feel less nervous."]},{"begin":"286.520","end":"294.400","lines":["And why is anxiety so pervasive? We know what we\u2019re going to say. Oftentimes we know who we\u2019re speaking to. Why do we get anxious?"]},{"begin":"294.400","end":"310.280","lines":["So many of us who study this believe it\u2019s evolutionary. It\u2019s part of being human. It goes back to when our species was evolving. We would hang out in groups of about 150 people. And your relative status in that group meant a lot."]},{"begin":"310.280","end":"330.600","lines":["And when I\u2019m talking about status, I\u2019m not talking about who drives the fancy car or who gets more likes on their videos. I\u2019m talking about your position in a hierarchy where the higher the status you had, the more access you got to things like food and shelter and reproduction. And if you were low status, that meant your life was in jeopardy."]},{"begin":"330.600","end":"352.360","lines":["So anything that puts your status at risk should make you nervous. And that\u2019s ingrained in us. And we see speaking anxiety in all cultures. It tends to develop when children become teenagers, which is when we become much more socially aware and part of a culture. So a lot of people believe this is ingrained in who we are, and we just have to learn to manage it."]},{"begin":"352.360","end":"356.800","lines":["That\u2019s fascinating. I had no idea it went so far back in being human."]},{"begin":"356.800","end":"359.680","lines":["Yeah. It is part of our condition."]},{"begin":"359.680","end":"366.480","lines":["So let\u2019s get into the nitty-gritty and talk about how we can actually manage this anxiety when we\u2019re speaking."]},{"begin":"366.480","end":"382.000","lines":["Yeah. And there are lots of ways to do it. There are many academically verified techniques. When we look at managing anxiety, I like to break it up into two different buckets. There are the symptoms that we experience as well as the sources of anxiety."]},{"begin":"382.000","end":"391.040","lines":["So we need to focus on both to become more confident. The symptoms are what we experience. The sources are what make our anxiety even worse."]},{"begin":"391.040","end":"402.400","lines":["Mmm, interesting. So your thing is kind of holding a cold bottle of water. I\u2019ve seen you do it. I\u2019ve heard people refer to this. Can you tell me more about that?"]},{"begin":"402.400","end":"422.440","lines":["So when I get nervous, the big thing that happens to me is I perspire and I blush. And this is a very normal symptomatic response to anxiety. When you get nervous, your heartbeat goes up, your body constricts so your blood pressure goes up. And this drives up your core body temperature. It\u2019s like you\u2019re working out, you\u2019re exercising."]},{"begin":"422.440","end":"435.840","lines":["So holding a cold bottle of water in the palm of your hand actually can cool you down. Your palms, just like your forehead when you have a fever, are thermo-regulators for your body. So holding something cold can reduce your core body temperature."]},{"begin":"435.840","end":"447.400","lines":["I\u2019m sure on a cold day, Jenny, you\u2019ve seen this work in reverse. If you\u2019ve ever held warm coffee or tea, you\u2019ve felt how it warms you up. Holding a cold bottle of water can cool you down. So I do that religiously."]},{"begin":"447.400","end":"470.320","lines":["There are other types of techniques we can use to manage our symptoms. So if you\u2019re somebody who shakes a lot, doing big, broad gestures or moving when you speak can give that adrenaline a place to go. If you\u2019re somebody who gets dry mouth, drinking something warm or sucking on a lozenge or chewing gum \u2014 before you speak, not while \u2014 can help reverse those symptoms."]},{"begin":"470.320","end":"495.160","lines":["So the bottom line is there are things we can do to manage the symptoms. And by far the most important is taking a deep breath. By taking a deep belly breath, like you\u2019re doing yoga or tai chi or qi gong, it really slows down your heart rate, which is the impetus and initiator of many of the anxiety symptoms that we find. So things we can do to manage our symptoms absolutely exist."]},{"begin":"495.160","end":"507.080","lines":["I love those. They\u2019re really practical tools that I can use: deep breath, cold bottle of water, just really kind of centering in the moment. I\u2019m going to use the big-gesture thing, too."]},{"begin":"507.080","end":"527.320","lines":["Another source of anxiety that makes people really nervous is their fear of what might happen in the future. So my students are afraid they might not get a good grade. The entrepreneurs I coach, they\u2019re afraid that they might not get the funding or support that they need. You might be concerned that your idea isn\u2019t supported and acted upon."]},{"begin":"527.320","end":"541.600","lines":["Those are fears that come from a future state, a potential negative future outcome. So the way to short-circuit that is to become present-oriented. If you\u2019re in the moment, you can\u2019t be worried about the future, by definition."]},{"begin":"541.600","end":"573.040","lines":["So how do you get present-oriented? Many things you can do. I like to do something physical. Maybe walk around the building. I love to shake hands with people before I speak, because I have to engage with them. I can\u2019t be thinking about all these things that could go wrong if I\u2019m asking somebody how they\u2019re doing. You can do what athletes do. Listen to a song or a playlist. That can get you present-oriented. I often encourage my students to start at 100 and count backwards by 17s. You can\u2019t do that without being in the present moment."]},{"begin":"573.040","end":"596.200","lines":["And finally\u2013and this is a little silly, Jenny\u2013my favorite way of getting present-oriented is to say tongue twisters. You can\u2019t say a tongue twister right and not be in the present moment. So before I ever give a presentation or contribute to a meeting where I\u2019m really nervous, I\u2019ll be holding a bottle of water, standing in the corner saying a tongue twister. Nobody sees me do it, and it gets me in the right place to be able to communicate confidently."]},{"begin":"596.200","end":"604.160","lines":["Those things probably feel silly when you\u2019re doing them, but I imagine they\u2019re well worth it if it\u2019s going to help you get through a presentation confidently."]},{"begin":"604.160","end":"621.040","lines":["You\u2019re exactly right. Not only does it sometimes feel silly, but it also gives you a sense of agency. You feel like you can do something in the situation where you feel nervous. Many people just feel like they\u2019re swept away by their anxiety. And this actually gives you something to do that helps you feel better."]},{"begin":"621.040","end":"636.560","lines":["Cool. Well, there\u2019s something else I\u2019ve been wanting to ask your advice on, going back to this toast that I had to give at a friend\u2019s wedding. My biggest fear when I got up there and I had the microphone was that I was going to completely blank out, and I was going to forget everything I had prepared."]},{"begin":"636.560","end":"638.840","lines":["So what do you say to that?"]},{"begin":"638.840","end":"644.560","lines":["That is, by far, the number-one fear I hear from people when I do the work I do is I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to blank out."]},{"begin":"644.560","end":"653.960","lines":["And blanking out can happen. If you really think about it, the likelihood of totally blanking out is pretty low. So just doing that rationalization can help."]},{"begin":"653.960","end":"671.920","lines":["There are three things I want to suggest about blanking out. First, a great way to avoid blanking out is to take time to really map out your content. I\u2019m not saying word-for-word memorize. Memorizing actually can work against you. It can make you more nervous. But if you have a map, a structure, that can help."]},{"begin":"671.920","end":"696.440","lines":["Now, if you\u2019re in the moment and you blank out, two bits of advice. First, just like if you were to lose your keys, go back to go forward. Even if we can\u2019t remember what we want to say next, we typically can remember what we just said. And simply by repeating what you just said, it will often get you back on track. And some people feel like, oh, that\u2019s going to be weird to repeat what I just said, but, in fact, your audience benefits from you repeating things."]},{"begin":"696.440","end":"713.920","lines":["So the first thing to do if you blank out in the moment is to repeat what you just said. The second thing: In advance of speaking, always have what I call a back-pocket question, a question you can pull out to ask your audience to get them engaged in something else so you can collect your thoughts."]},{"begin":"713.920","end":"722.600","lines":["So I\u2019m going to let you in on a little secret. And if any of my former students are listening, you\u2019re going to learn something that you saw play out in class, but you didn\u2019t know was a trick I was using."]},{"begin":"722.600","end":"738.440","lines":["There are times when I am lecturing, where I\u2019ll forget what I need to say next. So I have a back-pocket question. I will simply stop when I blank out, and I\u2019ll ask my students to think about how what we just covered could be applied to their life."]},{"begin":"738.440","end":"751.440","lines":["And when I do that, my students actually just take a moment to think. Some of them have told me it\u2019s really helpful, because they\u2019re really applying this stuff. What\u2019s happening in the background is in my head, I\u2019m, like, oh, my goodness, what do I need to say next? I\u2019m buying myself some time."]},{"begin":"751.440","end":"766.160","lines":["So all of us in our communication can think of a question or two that we could ask in most places in what we\u2019re speaking about to get our audience to think about something so we can buy ourselves time."]},{"begin":"766.160","end":"781.800","lines":["So by simply knowing things you can do in advance and during blanking out, it actually reduces the likelihood you\u2019ll blank out, because we get so nervous about blanking out, it makes blanking out more likely. So having those things at the ready can really help."]},{"begin":"781.800","end":"797.400","lines":["It\u2019s so great to hear that even though you\u2019re an expert in communication, you still blank out, and you have all these little techniques. It\u2019s not so black and white, whether you\u2019re good at speaking or not good at speaking. It\u2019s about using those techniques to really rise above."]},{"begin":"797.400","end":"814.040","lines":["You\u2019re absolutely right. I think everyone can learn to manage their anxiety. And it is so important to do. So many people have important things to contribute at their work and their personal lives, in public discourse. And if anxiety is getting in the way, we need to do something about it."]},{"begin":"814.040","end":"821.640","lines":["So like you always do, I\u2019m going to ask you the same three questions at the end of this episode. And I\u2019m really curious to hear your answers \u2014"]},{"begin":"821.640","end":"822.240","lines":["Uh-oh."]},{"begin":"822.240","end":"823.400","lines":["\u2014 because I\u2019ve heard you ask so many people."]},{"begin":"823.400","end":"825.760","lines":["Uh-oh. All right. I\u2019m ready. Bring it."]},{"begin":"825.760","end":"834.440","lines":["If you were to capture the best communication advice you\u2019ve ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"834.440","end":"845.600","lines":["So I mentioned this before on an earlier podcast, when Lauren Weinstein and I were talking. But this, I think, is really critical. \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock.\u201d"]},{"begin":"845.600","end":"862.360","lines":["And the reason this is so powerful is it contains so many important bits of advice. First, be concise. Be clear. Be focused. And in order to be concise and clear and focused, you have to know who you\u2019re speaking to. So you have to reflect on who\u2019s my audience."]},{"begin":"862.360","end":"876.640","lines":["So in that statement \u2014 and I heard that first from my mother years and years ago \u2014 \u201cTell me the time. Don\u2019t build the clock.\u201d It really focuses us on the key elements of what I think it takes to be successful in your communication."]},{"begin":"876.640","end":"880.440","lines":["And who is a communicator that you most admire and why?"]},{"begin":"880.440","end":"896.560","lines":["This is so hard. I used to say any of the amazingly brave young students who survived the Parkland shooting in Florida. I was so in awe of their ability to communicate. And I still am."]},{"begin":"896.560","end":"916.040","lines":["But I recently heard an amazing TED talk on the topic of confidence by a young woman named Brittany Packnett. And her presentation just floored me, not just because the topic is near and dear to my heart regarding confidence, but her execution of the communication was phenomenal."]},{"begin":"916.040","end":"921.560","lines":["Did you notice how I snuck in a couple things there, Jenny? So I gave you two, not just one."]},{"begin":"921.560","end":"931.360","lines":["I\u2019m going to have to look up that TED talk. And finally, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"931.360","end":"945.000","lines":["Yeah. So I did a lot of work looking into this. When my business partner and I formed our consulting practice about 10 years ago, we scoured the literature to try to find what are the essential ingredients to successful communication."]},{"begin":"945.000","end":"968.040","lines":["And we came down to three, and we call them the three Cs. The three Cs are being confident, being connected \u2014 that is, making your content relevant, being present with your audience \u2014 and then finally being compelling. There are lots of ways to say things, but if you can say things in a compelling way that touch people, that are vivid, that use emotion, it can really, really help."]},{"begin":"968.040","end":"976.800","lines":["So it\u2019s about confidence, connection, and being compelling."]},{"begin":"976.800","end":"991.560","lines":["Awesome. Thank you so much. I\u2019ve learned a lot, and I\u2019m kind of ready to go out and give another toast or speech now with all these skills."]},{"begin":"991.560","end":"1011.320","lines":["I hope you do. And thank you so much for asking these important questions. And you\u2019re a pretty darn good host. I got a lot I could learn from you. Thanks for sitting in the hosting chair."]},{"begin":"1011.320","end":"1018.000","lines":["Thanks, Matt."]}]}
