For example, we use gender when we refer to our cars, our tools, even our storms like hurricanes. Today we explore gender on people and things. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"Today I am super excited to be joined by Ashley Martin, who is an associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford GSB. Ashley\u2019s research focuses on gender equality and inclusion, and she teaches a course in managing groups and teams. Welcome, Ashley. I\u2019m super happy to get a chance to speak with you."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Thank you so much, Matt. I\u2019m really excited to be here."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"Awesome. Well, let\u2019s rock and roll, and I literally mean that. I\u2019d like to chat about how I first came to know your research. I read about a rock study you did that shed interesting light on gender and gender roles. Can you please share your rock study? What was that all about?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"So, in this study, we were trying to capture how important gender is when we think about what it means to be human. And so, usually the way people do this is they look at faces or they use neural imaging. And oftentimes this is because it\u2019s really hard to isolate social categories when we\u2019re thinking about human beings. They come with a variety of them. So, when looking at any given person, we can see their race, their age, their gender, their level of attractiveness. And so, it\u2019s really hard to isolate the importance of any given social category."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, what we did was we thought we would use the process of anthropomorphism. And for everyone listening, anthropomorphism, you do it all the time, I guarantee. It\u2019s essentially treating a nonhuman thing as if it was human, as if it has unique emotions or a personality. We do it all the time. We see faces in plugs on the wall. We treat our pets as if they\u2019re part of the family. We talk to our plants or our cars. And what this allows us to do is really create a human out of something that\u2019s not there and see which social categories go along with that."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, what we did in the lab with the rock was we had participants come in the lab and we gave them a river rock \u2014 so a 5 to 7 inch river rock \u2014 and a bunch of googly eyes, some pompoms, sparkles, paints, markers, an embarrassment of riches of materials, and we asked them to make a pet rock, to create a humanlike rock to make the rock come alive. And so, they were given about 15 minutes to decorate a humanlike rock."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, once they finished that task, we asked them the importance of different social categories in doing that task. So, how important was gender while you were creating a rock, how important was race or age or sexual orientation, a number of different social categories that are usually important when we look at a human being. And what we found was very interesting, in my opinion. Almost everyone used gender when they were anthropomorphizing their rock, and it was very easy to see."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"You can see it with the eyelashes, with rosy cheeks, with the beards, the long hair, the jewelry. It was just very apparent the gender of this rock. Well, other social categories were harder to tell. And what was also very interesting about that study was that we found that gender was also the most predictive social category in how humanlike that rock was seen to be. And so, that study really showed us how important gender is in humanization."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"That, to me, is just fascinating not only because of the results \u2014 and I think it\u2019s interesting that rock and role, spelled very differently, really make a difference. And I applaud your creativity in the research design. And how fun. I mean, it sounds like your lab looked like a kindergarten art center, but it really made some interesting difference."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I want to stay on the conversation of nonhuman things because I hear that you\u2019ve looked into the impact of assigning gender to technology, things like Siri and Alexa. But what did you find and what can we take away from your work on this assignment of gender to technology, especially in the world of AI and ChatGPT?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Technology is being increasingly anthropomorphized as technology is fulfilling more humanlike roles, more social roles if you will. We\u2019re seeing it viewed with more humanlike qualities. From chatbots to virtual assistants, technology is being created in humanlike ways. And with the study that I just talked about, we realize this interesting phenomenon is gender is really facilitating the process of seeing something as human. And so, how is that going to affect the way in which we interact with gendered versus nongendered technology."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And one reason it\u2019s important to explore the relationship is actually because gender stereotypes in technology are very harmful. So, when we imbue Siri and Alexa with a female name and a female voice, what we\u2019re doing is reifying these stereotypes and roles of women, that women are more helpful and they\u2019re kind and they\u2019re caring, which are actually quite problematic. But the results of Amelia and I\u2019s rock study, what it really showed us is actually gender is this humanizing force that allows people to interact with nonhuman things as if they\u2019re human."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, we looked at that very question in the study that you\u2019re talking about where we thought that gender might provide a way to feel more attached or connected to our anthropomorphized technology. And so, we looked at this in a number of ways."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"One was through Amazon reviews."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And we found that with robotic vacuums, for example, of when people anthropomorphized those robotic vacuums and gave them a gender, they saw them as more humanlike, and they used more affiliative language when they talked about it, so they used words like \u201cI loved this product,\u201d \u201cThis is my friend,\u201d they gave it a name, they really liked the product, and they gave it a higher rating. So, that was an interesting finding."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, we decided to test it more experimentally where we looked at voice assistants, autonomous vehicles. And what we found was even just using a pronoun, so describing a car a she versus a he versus not describing it with a pronoun at all, we find that people feel more attached to gendered technology in part because they see it as more humanlike."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, really that study unearthed this paradox of gender where gender\u2019s problematic \u2014 it\u2019s reifying some really problematic stereotypes \u2014 but it\u2019s also this humanizing force that allows us to see something as more human. And so, there\u2019s really a tension between amplifying these gender stereotypes and also promoting anthropomorphism."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I see this happen all the time where people give gendered associations with things that aren\u2019t real. I was in a company recently where the conference rooms were all named for women, and that\u2019s interesting. And we actually on this show when I interviewed ChatGPT, we put the typed responses into a voice simulator. And we had to choose what voice do we use, and we consciously chose a female voice because we thought it sounded less threatening than male voice. So, you\u2019re making me question decisions I make and decisions I see all the time, so thank you for that. It\u2019s very provocative."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"You did some work on the difference between identity aware and identity blind approaches to race and gender. Can you define what is meant by these two approaches, and what did you find, and what recommendations come from that research?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Yeah, I\u2019m really glad you brought up this research because it actually builds on the importance of gender. So, this is really outlining the problems with gender. And so, to answer your question about defining identity awareness and blindness, so the formal definition is these are ideologies around how to best approach differences in diverse settings."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"To break that down a little bit, there\u2019s really two approaches to navigating diversity. There\u2019s some nuance there, but really they fall into two categories. One is about embracing differences, amplifying differences, recognizing differences, and another is ignoring differences or deemphasizing differences, really focusing on what people have in common. And we\u2019ve seen this a lot in the race literature."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"If you\u2019ve heard of colorblindness and multiculturalism, these are, in essence, diversity ideologies. One is saying we should be aware of race differences, we should talk about them, and another is saying actually we shouldn\u2019t, we\u2019re all people, we\u2019re all humans, we\u2019re all Americans. We should just really ignore race in favor of a common identity."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, a lot of research \u2014 this is not my research \u2014 a lot of research, in fact, over a hundred papers, have looked at race diversity ideologies, and a lot of it has found that multiculturalism or this awareness approach is a better strategy. It leads people to feel more included. It allows people to recognize discrimination or unequal opportunities. You really can\u2019t recognize differences in opportunities if you\u2019re not talking about differences. It makes people feel less anxious. It just has a host of positive consequences."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, in my work, which was recently published, I looked at the implications of this for gender. So, looking at let\u2019s take the exact same approaches to difference that we\u2019re talking about for race and just apply them to gender. So, is it good to discuss, amplify, emphasize gender differences or minimalize them, deemphasize them in favor of similarities? And what was interesting is I found the exact opposite results for gender compared to race."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"So, I actually found that when you tell people to emphasize or amplify gender differences, it\u2019s actually increasing stereotyping, it is related to more bias, less support for diversity policies. So, it\u2019s having this divergent effect. The exact same approach to diversity is having a divergent effect for gender. And why this is happening is because the types of differences that are being evoked for race and gender are actually quite unique."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"When you tell people to be aware of race differences, they usually think of things like culture, cultural backgrounds, or they think about experiences, how people are treated, and opportunities, so inequality, discrimination. And these are really helpful differences to be mindful of, and so it leads to all these adaptive outcomes. For women, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening, that\u2019s not what people are thinking about. They\u2019re not really thinking about different experiences women face, different opportunities or hurdles that women have to overcome. They\u2019re thinking about stereotypes."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"So, they\u2019re thinking, yes, women have all these great qualities like what we were talking about with Siri and Alexa. They\u2019re empathetic and they\u2019re incredibly helpful and they\u2019re good mentors, and they think these are really positive things. Men are dominant and assertive, and sometimes we don\u2019t even like those qualities, but those are the qualities that we associate with leadership. And so, by highlighting these gender differences, we\u2019re actually reifying these stereotypes that end up undermining equality."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, you asked what can we do with this? How do organizations end up using this? What advice would I give? And I guess it would be two-fold. One is that I can\u2019t really support monolithic diversity strategies because what I\u2019m finding in my own work is that the exact same approach to diversity where people are told to embrace differences is leading to adaptive outcomes for racial minorities and maladaptive outcomes for women. And so, this is quite problematic. You don\u2019t really want a one size fits all diversity strategy."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And then the second would be to focus on the right types of differences. I think we have broad statements around embracing differences or being aware of differences. And what I\u2019m finding is that people aren\u2019t thinking about the same differences for every group."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, I think we want to be aware of differences like discrimination or inequality, and we don\u2019t want to amplify these stereotypes around leadership. And so, perhaps orienting people around which differences we should be discussing and talking about might provide a fruitful avenue for solving problems related to inequality."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s really powerful. What I hear you say is in the diversity, equity and inclusion, the DEI work that people do, including belonging as well, that we need to be more nuanced, that we need to separate out these different aspects versus treating it as one size fits all. And I know in companies I\u2019ve been in and companies I consult in, there\u2019s this go to the diversity training and it treats it all as one thing. And it sounds like it would be much wiser and more equitable in a more nuanced way. I hope everybody listening reflects on that, for sure."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I\u2019d like to turn our attention to some other research you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve looked specifically at hiring more women into senior leadership rocs. What does this do for organizations in general and well as for women within those organizations?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Thanks for bringing up the study. This is with my collaborators: Sandra Matz, Asher Lawson and Imrul Huda. And what we did in this study is we actually looked at organizational language through shareholder documents and investor calls, and we looked how that language changed after hiring a female CEO compared to not."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"So, what we found is that stereotypes reflected in language changes after hiring a woman. And women, after being hired into the CEO position, tend to be described in more agentic or leaderlike ways. And so, this very act of hiring a female CEO is actually changing a lot of different organizational language whether it be investor calls or shareholder documents. So, what I took away from this research is actually changing representation can change stereotypes, and that\u2019s reversing the intuition that we have when we go about solving diversity problems."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"When we think about DEI programs, implicit bias training, really the goal here is to change people, to change their own stereotypes, to change their own behavior so that we can create a culture that\u2019s more inclusive and end up hiring more women. And what this paper is showing is that actually hiring more women can change the very stereotypes that we\u2019re seeking to mitigate through a lot of these diversity strategies, and it leads to this virtuous cycle."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"So, it sounds to me as if doing both could be really helpful, hiring more women and also continuing to work on the stereotypes. And then all of a sudden you get this multiplier effect."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Absolutely. And that goes back to something that you just said, which is DEI programs are incredibly difficult. And if I\u2019ve learned anything, that everything is more complicated and more nuanced than I think I previously knew. And so, I applaud diversity programs and companies that are implementing them, because they\u2019re important, but certainly they are hard, and they are challenging, and they require a lot more nuance than I think that we\u2019re currently giving."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"So, that\u2019s advice to everyone. It\u2019s keep up with the work, but just do the work in a more nuanced, reflective way, and take advantage of your research and that of others, for sure."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I want to move away from your research and into your teaching. You teach a course on managing groups and teams. Can you share two key concepts you cover as well as the role that communication might play in successful team management?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Yes. I love this course. So, I think groups and teams are so important. They\u2019re really what makes organizations and the human species successful. We are really a successful species because we\u2019re able to work well in groups. So, this course is a pleasure to teach. We cover a lot of concepts. So, we talk about diversity and hierarchy and process. So, it\u2019s really tough to pick one of my favorite."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"I think one topic that covers a lot of different problems is the idea of process loss. So, process loss is really anything that undermines a team\u2019s performance or ability to succeed. And sometimes those problems fall into coordination, so people\u2019s ability to work together, sometimes motivation where people become not willing to put in the effort, and sometimes ability, so we don\u2019t structure teams in ways that allow them to use the talent within them."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And one of the solutions that we talk about is roles. So, it\u2019s really important in teams to have roles, to know who to turn to for what, to know who\u2019s in charge when so that you can effectively focus on your task at hand. And so, that\u2019s one thing that I think is really important and I try to cover in my class."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And it also leads to your second question here, which is we talk a lot about roles in communication, and that\u2019s very important. So, in order to effectively communicate, there are different roles you can have and you can use. And so, we talk about the four-player model, which is essentially breaking down actions of communications and teams."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, there were four possible acts that one can use in a team when they\u2019re communicating. One is a movement where someone initiatives something, they have an idea, they recommend something. So, that\u2019s move. And there\u2019s support where someone amplifies something that the mover has said, they support it, they reify the intention. There\u2019s also opposition where someone says, \u201cI disagree. I think we should take a step back.\u201d And then there\u2019s reflection where people reflect back what\u2019s going on as a team or some of the dynamics that are happening."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, in order for effective communication to occur, we often recommend that all of these actions are equally represented in the team. So, you need enough movement to have momentum towards a certain path, you need support to create cohesion in our team to make people feel like they like each other, you also need opposition so that you\u2019re not blindly moving down the wrong path, and you need reflection to create collective intelligence so that teams can understand how they\u2019re working together and do better on the next task."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"So, not only do those four acts need to be equally represented in a team dynamic or conversation, but they should also be equally represented in terms of an individual. So, you want to make sure that you\u2019re engaging in all four of these acts. If you get stuck in a role where let\u2019s say you\u2019re the opposer, you\u2019re always saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d you might just be seen as the curmudgeonly person who\u2019s disagreeable rather than the person who\u2019s bringing up actually a very good problem or something that people should pay attention to."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And so, in sum, I think the class highlights the importance of different roles, and those roles could be the leadership roles, it could be your role on a team and how you contribute, and they could also be the roles that you play in creating effective communication."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"You did my job of summarizing very well, thank you. You\u2019re supporting. One of the things that I was thinking of as you were articulating roles and in those different movements, I think it would be beneficial for everybody to reflect on a recent team interaction they had, and think about what role were you playing, what roles were others playing, where were you over indexed, you had too many people doing one thing, and where were you missing. And then do exactly the same thing with the communication that happened."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I often talk about \u2014 and listeners have heard me say this \u2014 that we need to reflect on the communication that we have in our lives in order to change it. Otherwise, we\u2019re doing that definition of insanity: same thing over and over again expecting different results. And you gave us some very interesting tools and ways of breaking that down, and thank you for that. I think that all of us could benefit from reflecting on the roles we had and the moves we and others make."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"Well, Ashley, before we end, I\u2019d love for you to answer the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"All right. Here we go. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Don\u2019t be afraid to use silence. I like this advice, it\u2019s actually thinking of it on the spot, but I think silence is a powerful tool. I think oftentimes when we\u2019re communicating, we\u2019re afraid of it, and we try to fill gaps and voids in conversation. But I also think that prevents us from listening, from being able to engage, and also to exude an executive presence. The most effective communicators I know are really the ones who are comfortable with silence. They let the room speak. They summarize what\u2019s going on and engage with what\u2019s going on because they\u2019re able to hold space for that."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"Did I wait long enough to prove the point? The power of silence is very real. It signals so many things. It signals comfort, it signals listening, it invites reflection. It\u2019s a powerful tool, and it\u2019s one, as you rightly mentioned, I believe, people don\u2019t focus on. Makes us feel very uncomfortable."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"Question number two: who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"I would say Deb Gruenfeld. She\u2019s my colleague here at the GSB, and I just love watching her communicate. She uses silence so well. She is a perfect example of someone who really is so powerful and doesn\u2019t need to talk all the time. When I came into the classroom and I started teaching MBAs, I did this thing where I would come up to the front of the class and I would clap and say, \u201cHey, listen up, I\u2019m here,\u201d and try to get their attention in that way. And I would think that I needed to talk, to be the one who\u2019s sharing information and teaching them something."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And then I watched Deb teach, and she just comes up to the front of the classroom and she\u2019s silent, and she waits for people to stop talking and engage with her. She was really able to hold space for other people to talk. She really listens. And there\u2019s such power in using those tools to communicate. So, I really admire the way she does it. I\u2019m still learning to do it as well as Deb \u2014 I\u2019m not even close \u2014 but I\u2019ve learned a lot from her about communication."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"So, Deb is a wonderful person and a fantastic teacher, and she was one of our early guests. So, anybody wanting to listen to the way in which Deb communicates, please go back and listen to that episode. It was all about power and nonverbal presence. It was fascinating."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"All right. Question number three: what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"The words I would use are listen, engage, and express."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"So, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about listening with silence. Tell me more about engage and express."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"I think engaging comes from listening, so you need to do that first. But really hearing what people are saying and engaging with those particular questions and those particular problems, I think sometimes \u2014 at least they used to \u2014 have setpoints that I wanted to communicate. And oftentimes I was missing what people actually cared about or what they actually wanted to know, and there was a better entry point for me to do that if I really took in what they were saying and tried to engage on that level. So, that\u2019s where that piece of advice comes from."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"And then express is going against that advice in some ways. It\u2019s engaging, but if there is something at the end of that that you still want to communicate or you still want to say that either violates the room or what people want to engage with, I think that\u2019s still important to communicate because there should be a message that you want to transmit and for people to hear and listen to and leave with."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"So, in essence, you needed to share your voice to share your opinion even if it\u2019s not what was expected. I like it. I\u2019m a big fan of trying to remember things. So, it\u2019s EEL. It\u2019s express, engage, and listen."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"I\u2019m glad you said that. I was hoping for three Es; it didn\u2019t happen, but you know."},{"author":"Matthew Abrahams","text":"I think it works. I think it works. Well, Ashley, it was a true pleasure having you here. I learned so much. I learned that some of the things that I did and my children did as kindergartners can actually enlighten us academically, that nuance is important when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, and really reflecting on our roles and the type of communication we have in teams is so important. Thank you so much, and I appreciate the teachings you provided us with."},{"author":"Ashley Martin","text":"Oh, thank you so much.

I\u2019d like to chat about how I first came to know your research. I read about a rock study you did that shed interesting light on gender and gender roles. Can you please share your rock study? What was that all about?"]},{"begin":"70.160","end":"103.720","lines":["So, in this study, we were trying to capture how important gender is when we think about what it means to be human. And so, usually the way people do this is they look at faces or they use neural imaging. And oftentimes this is because it\u2019s really hard to isolate social categories when we\u2019re thinking about human beings. They come with a variety of them. So, when looking at any given person, we can see their race, their age, their gender, their level of attractiveness. And so, it\u2019s really hard to isolate the importance of any given social category."]},{"begin":"103.720","end":"138.080","lines":["And so, what we did was we thought we would use the process of anthropomorphism. And for everyone listening, anthropomorphism, you do it all the time, I guarantee. It\u2019s essentially treating a nonhuman thing as if it was human, as if it has unique emotions or a personality. We do it all the time. We see faces in plugs on the wall. We treat our pets as if they\u2019re part of the family. We talk to our plants or our cars. And what this allows us to do is really create a human out of something that\u2019s not there and see which social categories go along with that."]},{"begin":"138.080","end":"166.160","lines":["And so, what we did in the lab with the rock was we had participants come in the lab and we gave them a river rock \u2014 so a 5 to 7 inch river rock \u2014 and a bunch of googly eyes, some pompoms, sparkles, paints, markers, an embarrassment of riches of materials, and we asked them to make a pet rock, to create a humanlike rock to make the rock come alive. And so, they were given about 15 minutes to decorate a humanlike rock."]},{"begin":"166.160","end":"194.200","lines":["And so, once they finished that task, we asked them the importance of different social categories in doing that task. So, how important was gender while you were creating a rock, how important was race or age or sexual orientation, a number of different social categories that are usually important when we look at a human being.

Almost everyone used gender when they were anthropomorphizing their rock, and it was very easy to see."]},{"begin":"194.200","end":"224.280","lines":["You can see it with the eyelashes, with rosy cheeks, with the beards, the long hair, the jewelry. It was just very apparent the gender of this rock. Well, other social categories were harder to tell.

And so, how is that going to affect the way in which we interact with gendered versus nongendered technology."]},{"begin":"296.800","end":"328.320","lines":["And one reason it\u2019s important to explore the relationship is actually because gender stereotypes in technology are very harmful. So, when we imbue Siri and Alexa with a female name and a female voice, what we\u2019re doing is reifying these stereotypes and roles of women, that women are more helpful and they\u2019re kind and they\u2019re caring, which are actually quite problematic. But the results of Amelia and I\u2019s rock study, what it really showed us is actually gender is this humanizing force that allows people to interact with nonhuman things as if they\u2019re human."]},{"begin":"328.320","end":"341.240","lines":["And so, we looked at that very question in the study that you\u2019re talking about where we thought that gender might provide a way to feel more attached or connected to our anthropomorphized technology. And so, we looked at this in a number of ways."]},{"begin":"341.240","end":"343.280","lines":["One was through Amazon reviews."]},{"begin":"343.280","end":"367.720","lines":["And we found that with robotic vacuums, for example, of when people anthropomorphized those robotic vacuums and gave them a gender, they saw them as more humanlike, and they used more affiliative language when they talked about it, so they used words like \u201cI loved this product,\u201d \u201cThis is my friend,\u201d they gave it a name, they really liked the product, and they gave it a higher rating. So, that was an interesting finding."]},{"begin":"367.720","end":"388.560","lines":["And so, we decided to test it more experimentally where we looked at voice assistants, autonomous vehicles. And what we found was even just using a pronoun, so describing a car a she versus a he versus not describing it with a pronoun at all, we find that people feel more attached to gendered technology in part because they see it as more humanlike."]},{"begin":"388.560","end":"409.760","lines":["And so, really that study unearthed this paradox of gender where gender\u2019s problematic \u2014 it\u2019s reifying some really problematic stereotypes \u2014 but it\u2019s also this humanizing force that allows us to see something as more human. And so, there\u2019s really a tension between amplifying these gender stereotypes and also promoting anthropomorphism."]},{"begin":"409.760","end":"444.000","lines":["I see this happen all the time where people give gendered associations with things that aren\u2019t real. I was in a company recently where the conference rooms were all named for women, and that\u2019s interesting. And we actually on this show when I interviewed ChatGPT, we put the typed responses into a voice simulator. And we had to choose what voice do we use, and we consciously chose a female voice because we thought it sounded less threatening than male voice. So, you\u2019re making me question decisions I make and decisions I see all the time, so thank you for that. It\u2019s very provocative."]},{"begin":"444.000","end":"458.760","lines":["You did some work on the difference between identity aware and identity blind approaches to race and gender. Can you define what is meant by these two approaches, and what did you find, and what recommendations come from that research?"]},{"begin":"458.760","end":"481.920","lines":["Yeah, I\u2019m really glad you brought up this research because it actually builds on the importance of gender. So, this is really outlining the problems with gender. And so, to answer your question about defining identity awareness and blindness, so the formal definition is these are ideologies around how to best approach differences in diverse settings."]},{"begin":"481.920","end":"506.680","lines":["To break that down a little bit, there\u2019s really two approaches to navigating diversity. There\u2019s some nuance there, but really they fall into two categories. One is about embracing differences, amplifying differences, recognizing differences, and another is ignoring differences or deemphasizing differences, really focusing on what people have in common. And we\u2019ve seen this a lot in the race literature."]},{"begin":"506.680","end":"525.080","lines":["If you\u2019ve heard of colorblindness and multiculturalism, these are, in essence, diversity ideologies. One is saying we should be aware of race differences, we should talk about them, and another is saying actually we shouldn\u2019t, we\u2019re all people, we\u2019re all humans, we\u2019re all Americans. We should just really ignore race in favor of a common identity."]},{"begin":"525.080","end":"559.360","lines":["And so, a lot of research \u2014 this is not my research \u2014 a lot of research, in fact, over a hundred papers, have looked at race diversity ideologies, and a lot of it has found that multiculturalism or this awareness approach is a better strategy. It leads people to feel more included. It allows people to recognize discrimination or unequal opportunities. You really can\u2019t recognize differences in opportunities if you\u2019re not talking about differences. It makes people feel less anxious. It just has a host of positive consequences."]},{"begin":"559.360","end":"586.240","lines":["And so, in my work, which was recently published, I looked at the implications of this for gender. So, looking at let\u2019s take the exact same approaches to difference that we\u2019re talking about for race and just apply them to gender. So, is it good to discuss, amplify, emphasize gender differences or minimalize them, deemphasize them in favor of similarities? And what was interesting is I found the exact opposite results for gender compared to race."]},{"begin":"586.240","end":"615.560","lines":["So, I actually found that when you tell people to emphasize or amplify gender differences, it\u2019s actually increasing stereotyping, it is related to more bias, less support for diversity policies. So, it\u2019s having this divergent effect. The exact same approach to diversity is having a divergent effect for gender. And why this is happening is because the types of differences that are being evoked for race and gender are actually quite unique."]},{"begin":"615.560","end":"647.720","lines":["When you tell people to be aware of race differences, they usually think of things like culture, cultural backgrounds, or they think about experiences, how people are treated, and opportunities, so inequality, discrimination. And these are really helpful differences to be mindful of, and so it leads to all these adaptive outcomes. For women, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening, that\u2019s not what people are thinking about. They\u2019re not really thinking about different experiences women face, different opportunities or hurdles that women have to overcome. They\u2019re thinking about stereotypes."]},{"begin":"647.720","end":"677.200","lines":["So, they\u2019re thinking, yes, women have all these great qualities like what we were talking about with Siri and Alexa. They\u2019re empathetic and they\u2019re incredibly helpful and they\u2019re good mentors, and they think these are really positive things. Men are dominant and assertive, and sometimes we don\u2019t even like those qualities, but those are the qualities that we associate with leadership. And so, by highlighting these gender differences, we\u2019re actually reifying these stereotypes that end up undermining equality."]},{"begin":"677.200","end":"709.600","lines":["And so, you asked what can we do with this? How do organizations end up using this? What advice would I give? And I guess it would be two-fold. One is that I can\u2019t really support monolithic diversity strategies because what I\u2019m finding in my own work is that the exact same approach to diversity where people are told to embrace differences is leading to adaptive outcomes for racial minorities and maladaptive outcomes for women. And so, this is quite problematic. You don\u2019t really want a one size fits all diversity strategy."]},{"begin":"709.600","end":"726.160","lines":["And then the second would be to focus on the right types of differences. I think we have broad statements around embracing differences or being aware of differences. And what I\u2019m finding is that people aren\u2019t thinking about the same differences for every group."]},{"begin":"726.160","end":"747.800","lines":["And so, I think we want to be aware of differences like discrimination or inequality, and we don\u2019t want to amplify these stereotypes around leadership. And so, perhaps orienting people around which differences we should be discussing and talking about might provide a fruitful avenue for solving problems related to inequality."]},{"begin":"747.800","end":"781.080","lines":["That\u2019s really powerful. What I hear you say is in the diversity, equity and inclusion, the DEI work that people do, including belonging as well, that we need to be more nuanced, that we need to separate out these different aspects versus treating it as one size fits all. And I know in companies I\u2019ve been in and companies I consult in, there\u2019s this go to the diversity training and it treats it all as one thing. And it sounds like it would be much wiser and more equitable in a more nuanced way. I hope everybody listening reflects on that, for sure."]},{"begin":"781.080","end":"796.120","lines":["I\u2019d like to turn our attention to some other research you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve looked specifically at hiring more women into senior leadership rocs. What does this do for organizations in general and well as for women within those organizations?"]},{"begin":"796.120","end":"815.480","lines":["Thanks for bringing up the study. This is with my collaborators: Sandra Matz, Asher Lawson and Imrul Huda. And what we did in this study is we actually looked at organizational language through shareholder documents and investor calls, and we looked how that language changed after hiring a female CEO compared to not."]},{"begin":"815.480","end":"851.760","lines":["So, what we found is that stereotypes reflected in language changes after hiring a woman. And women, after being hired into the CEO position, tend to be described in more agentic or leaderlike ways. And so, this very act of hiring a female CEO is actually changing a lot of different organizational language whether it be investor calls or shareholder documents. So, what I took away from this research is actually changing representation can change stereotypes, and that\u2019s reversing the intuition that we have when we go about solving diversity problems."]},{"begin":"851.760","end":"879.000","lines":["When we think about DEI programs, implicit bias training, really the goal here is to change people, to change their own stereotypes, to change their own behavior so that we can create a culture that\u2019s more inclusive and end up hiring more women. And what this paper is showing is that actually hiring more women can change the very stereotypes that we\u2019re seeking to mitigate through a lot of these diversity strategies, and it leads to this virtuous cycle."]},{"begin":"879.000","end":"889.640","lines":["So, it sounds to me as if doing both could be really helpful, hiring more women and also continuing to work on the stereotypes. And then all of a sudden you get this multiplier effect."]},{"begin":"889.640","end":"916.600","lines":["Absolutely. And that goes back to something that you just said, which is DEI programs are incredibly difficult. And if I\u2019ve learned anything, that everything is more complicated and more nuanced than I think I previously knew. And so, I applaud diversity programs and companies that are implementing them, because they\u2019re important, but certainly they are hard, and they are challenging, and they require a lot more nuance than I think that we\u2019re currently giving."]},{"begin":"916.600","end":"926.480","lines":["So, that\u2019s advice to everyone. It\u2019s keep up with the work, but just do the work in a more nuanced, reflective way, and take advantage of your research and that of others, for sure."]},{"begin":"926.480","end":"939.880","lines":["I want to move away from your research and into your teaching. You teach a course on managing groups and teams. Can you share two key concepts you cover as well as the role that communication might play in successful team management?"]},{"begin":"939.880","end":"963.640","lines":["Yes. I love this course. So, I think groups and teams are so important. They\u2019re really what makes organizations and the human species successful. We are really a successful species because we\u2019re able to work well in groups. So, this course is a pleasure to teach. We cover a lot of concepts. So, we talk about diversity and hierarchy and process. So, it\u2019s really tough to pick one of my favorite."]},{"begin":"963.640","end":"993.640","lines":["I think one topic that covers a lot of different problems is the idea of process loss. So, process loss is really anything that undermines a team\u2019s performance or ability to succeed. And sometimes those problems fall into coordination, so people\u2019s ability to work together, sometimes motivation where people become not willing to put in the effort, and sometimes ability, so we don\u2019t structure teams in ways that allow them to use the talent within them."]},{"begin":"993.640","end":"1014.400","lines":["And one of the solutions that we talk about is roles. So, it\u2019s really important in teams to have roles, to know who to turn to for what, to know who\u2019s in charge when so that you can effectively focus on your task at hand. And so, that\u2019s one thing that I think is really important and I try to cover in my class."]},{"begin":"1014.400","end":"1036.280","lines":["And it also leads to your second question here, which is we talk a lot about roles in communication, and that\u2019s very important. So, in order to effectively communicate, there are different roles you can have and you can use. And so, we talk about the four-player model, which is essentially breaking down actions of communications and teams."]},{"begin":"1036.280","end":"1072.040","lines":["And so, there were four possible acts that one can use in a team when they\u2019re communicating. One is a movement where someone initiatives something, they have an idea, they recommend something. So, that\u2019s move. And there\u2019s support where someone amplifies something that the mover has said, they support it, they reify the intention. There\u2019s also opposition where someone says, \u201cI disagree. I think we should take a step back.\u201d And then there\u2019s reflection where people reflect back what\u2019s going on as a team or some of the dynamics that are happening."]},{"begin":"1072.040","end":"1103.920","lines":["And so, in order for effective communication to occur, we often recommend that all of these actions are equally represented in the team. So, you need enough movement to have momentum towards a certain path, you need support to create cohesion in our team to make people feel like they like each other, you also need opposition so that you\u2019re not blindly moving down the wrong path, and you need reflection to create collective intelligence so that teams can understand how they\u2019re working together and do better on the next task."]},{"begin":"1103.920","end":"1135.520","lines":["So, not only do those four acts need to be equally represented in a team dynamic or conversation, but they should also be equally represented in terms of an individual. So, you want to make sure that you\u2019re engaging in all four of these acts. If you get stuck in a role where let\u2019s say you\u2019re the opposer, you\u2019re always saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d you might just be seen as the curmudgeonly person who\u2019s disagreeable rather than the person who\u2019s bringing up actually a very good problem or something that people should pay attention to."]},{"begin":"1135.520","end":"1151.440","lines":["And so, in sum, I think the class highlights the importance of different roles, and those roles could be the leadership roles, it could be your role on a team and how you contribute, and they could also be the roles that you play in creating effective communication."]},{"begin":"1151.440","end":"1180.840","lines":["You did my job of summarizing very well, thank you. You\u2019re supporting. One of the things that I was thinking of as you were articulating roles and in those different movements, I think it would be beneficial for everybody to reflect on a recent team interaction they had, and think about what role were you playing, what roles were others playing, where were you over indexed, you had too many people doing one thing, and where were you missing. And then do exactly the same thing with the communication that happened."]},{"begin":"1180.840","end":"1207.240","lines":["I often talk about \u2014 and listeners have heard me say this \u2014 that we need to reflect on the communication that we have in our lives in order to change it. Otherwise, we\u2019re doing that definition of insanity: same thing over and over again expecting different results. And you gave us some very interesting tools and ways of breaking that down, and thank you for that. I think that all of us could benefit from reflecting on the roles we had and the moves we and others make."]},{"begin":"1207.240","end":"1213.680","lines":["Well, Ashley, before we end, I\u2019d love for you to answer the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"1213.680","end":"1214.720","lines":["Absolutely."]},{"begin":"1214.720","end":"1226.440","lines":["All right. Here we go. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"1226.440","end":"1264.600","lines":["Don\u2019t be afraid to use silence. I like this advice, it\u2019s actually thinking of it on the spot, but I think silence is a powerful tool. I think oftentimes when we\u2019re communicating, we\u2019re afraid of it, and we try to fill gaps and voids in conversation. But I also think that prevents us from listening, from being able to engage, and also to exude an executive presence. The most effective communicators I know are really the ones who are comfortable with silence. They let the room speak. They summarize what\u2019s going on and engage with what\u2019s going on because they\u2019re able to hold space for that."]},{"begin":"1264.600","end":"1285.880","lines":["Did I wait long enough to prove the point? The power of silence is very real. It signals so many things. It signals comfort, it signals listening, it invites reflection. It\u2019s a powerful tool, and it\u2019s one, as you rightly mentioned, I believe, people don\u2019t focus on. Makes us feel very uncomfortable."]},{"begin":"1285.880","end":"1291.640","lines":["Question number two: who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1291.640","end":"1331.800","lines":["I would say Deb Gruenfeld. She\u2019s my colleague here at the GSB, and I just love watching her communicate. She uses silence so well. She is a perfect example of someone who really is so powerful and doesn\u2019t need to talk all the time. When I came into the classroom and I started teaching MBAs, I did this thing where I would come up to the front of the class and I would clap and say, \u201cHey, listen up, I\u2019m here,\u201d and try to get their attention in that way. And I would think that I needed to talk, to be the one who\u2019s sharing information and teaching them something."]},{"begin":"1331.800","end":"1359.600","lines":["And then I watched Deb teach, and she just comes up to the front of the classroom and she\u2019s silent, and she waits for people to stop talking and engage with her. She was really able to hold space for other people to talk. She really listens. And there\u2019s such power in using those tools to communicate. So, I really admire the way she does it. I\u2019m still learning to do it as well as Deb \u2014 I\u2019m not even close \u2014 but I\u2019ve learned a lot from her about communication."]},{"begin":"1359.600","end":"1375.680","lines":["So, Deb is a wonderful person and a fantastic teacher, and she was one of our early guests. So, anybody wanting to listen to the way in which Deb communicates, please go back and listen to that episode. It was all about power and nonverbal presence. It was fascinating."]},{"begin":"1375.680","end":"1383.560","lines":["All right. Question number three: what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1383.560","end":"1389.920","lines":["The words I would use are listen, engage, and express."]},{"begin":"1389.920","end":"1394.760","lines":["So, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about listening with silence. Tell me more about engage and express."]},{"begin":"1394.760","end":"1425.600","lines":["I think engaging comes from listening, so you need to do that first. But really hearing what people are saying and engaging with those particular questions and those particular problems, I think sometimes \u2014 at least they used to \u2014 have setpoints that I wanted to communicate. And oftentimes I was missing what people actually cared about or what they actually wanted to know, and there was a better entry point for me to do that if I really took in what they were saying and tried to engage on that level. So, that\u2019s where that piece of advice comes from."]},{"begin":"1425.600","end":"1448.960","lines":["And then express is going against that advice in some ways. It\u2019s engaging, but if there is something at the end of that that you still want to communicate or you still want to say that either violates the room or what people want to engage with, I think that\u2019s still important to communicate because there should be a message that you want to transmit and for people to hear and listen to and leave with."]},{"begin":"1448.960","end":"1463.280","lines":["So, in essence, you needed to share your voice to share your opinion even if it\u2019s not what was expected. I like it. I\u2019m a big fan of trying to remember things. So, it\u2019s EEL. It\u2019s express, engage, and listen."]},{"begin":"1463.280","end":"1467.040","lines":["I\u2019m glad you said that.

Well, Ashley, it was a true pleasure having you here. I learned so much. I learned that some of the things that I did and my children did as kindergartners can actually enlighten us academically, that nuance is important when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, and really reflecting on our roles and the type of communication we have in teams is so important.
