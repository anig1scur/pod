My name is Matt Abrahams and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today, I look forward to my conversation with David Brooks. David is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times, a writer for the Atlantic, and appears regularly on the PBS NewsHour. He\u2019s the best-selling author of several books, including The Road to Character, The Social Animal, and his latest book is How to Know a Person. Welcome, David. I\u2019m super excited for our chat today."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I\u2019m honored to be invited. Thank you for having me on."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. Are you ready to get started?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I am ready, willing, and able."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. Across your books and articles, you focus on the importance of connection and relationships. I\u2019m curious what drives your interest in this topic, and what role does communication play in fostering the connection you write about?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I wrote this book for two reasons. I wrote it partially for reasons of personal salvation. I grew up in one of those homes where we were not too emotionally open. We were not a kind of home where you said I love you and did all that hugging stuff. And so, I grew up a kind of an aloof personality type. And I became a writer, which is also a very solitary profession."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And so my joke is in high school, I wanted to date this woman named Bernice and she didn\u2019t want to date me. She wanted to date somebody else. And I remember thinking, what is she thinking? I rate way better than that guy. And so those were my values, but they were not the normal values of society. So, I just wanted to become, you know, if you hide yourself off from the emotional intimacies of life, you\u2019re hiding yourself off from life itself and you\u2019re not going to be very effective in your job."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"There was a study done by McKinsey where they asked CEOs, why do people leave your firm? And the CEO\u2019s number one answer was people leave our firm to make more money somewhere else. And then they asked the people who actually left, and their number one answer was, my manager didn\u2019t recognize me. And so human beings need recognition. They need to be seen, heard, and understood. There\u2019s nothing crueler than making somebody else feel invisible, feeling that you just don\u2019t get them."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And so if we\u2019re going to rebuild trust in our societies, if we\u2019re going to have decent politics in our societies. If we\u2019re going to have businesses where people trust each other and can work together, you have to get really good at being able to say, yeah, I know where you\u2019re coming to. I see the world a little from your point of view and you can trust me. And doing that is in part being open hearted. But partly it\u2019s a series of social skills. It\u2019s being a good listener, knowing how to argue well, knowing how to sit with someone who\u2019s depressed, knowing how to host a meeting where everybody feels included."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"These are just basic skills that can be taught, just the way carpentry can be taught, just the way sailing can be taught. And in the book, I just try to take people through the phases of getting to know another human being from the first time you meet them to when they\u2019re struggling from difficulty to what the deepest conversations of your life."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I appreciate you sharing your personal story for what motivated the book. And as those who listen to this podcast know, we\u2019re all about skills around communication to help people connect. And I love that you spend time itemizing those."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we get into some of the specific guidance and advice that you provide, I\u2019m curious if you wouldn\u2019t mind sharing some of the barriers to connection."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"What gets in the way and how can we remove some of those so we can truly see people and respect them?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"The first barrier is egotism. Most of us are too busy performing ourselves and thinking about ourselves so we can\u2019t really think about a person. The second barrier is anxiety. We have too much going on in our minds that we can\u2019t really think about the other. The third barrier is we can\u2019t see that we\u2019re so stuck in our own worldview, we can\u2019t see from her point of view. And then finally, I think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t ask questions and the essential skill of getting to know another human being is being a great conversationalist and especially asking great questions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to come back to one of the other barriers you talked about, this notion of worldview and then the other notion of our own ego. I really enjoyed learning about your view of empathy, which is something we talk a lot about on this podcast. You break the empathy down into a few components. Can you share those with us and provide us with some guidance on how to put them into action so we can be more empathetic?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"So, the first essence of developing good empathy is to understand you\u2019re wrong a lot of the time. And the second skill is mirroring. I\u2019m sitting with you and I\u2019m catching your emotions with my body. So, you\u2019re anxious or you\u2019re angry or you\u2019re sad. And I can feel it in my own body, I can just feel the emotion that\u2019s coming off you. And so that\u2019s called mirroring."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"The second is called mentalizing. And that\u2019s the ability to theorize what you\u2019re probably going through based on my own experience. So, it\u2019s your first day on the job. And I used to have a first day on the job and I know that you\u2019re filled with anxiety, you\u2019re filled with joy, oh, this is going to be an exciting place to work. You\u2019re sort of overwhelmed, maybe you have imposter syndrome. So, I\u2019ve been through that, and I can know what you\u2019re going through. And that\u2019s called mentalizing."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"The third stage of empathy is caring. And so, a con man is really good at knowing what other people are feeling, but we don\u2019t say they\u2019re empathetic because they don\u2019t care. And so, I need to be able to care effectively for you. And you can measure your own natural empathy skills by asking yourself some questions. Like, do people sometimes tell you go too far in driving home your point? Or do they, or do you feel comfortable showing up late to a meeting? If those are true of you, then you\u2019re probably have natural low empathy skills."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"On the other hand, are social conflicts very painful for you? And then you probably have natural high empathy skills. But we can all get better. We can all get better with training. And some of the ways to get better is to read literature. You get inside the minds of other people, if you have a novel going at all times, you\u2019re just getting good at getting inside the mind of other people. Drama is a great way; the most empathetic people have done some role playing. And so those are two very concrete ways you can improve your empathy skills."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And then the final one is just getting really good at recognizing your own emotions, comfortable in your own body. And so, people who have gone to theaters, read literature, thought about their relationships, they can just spot the emotions of the people around them and hence much higher social observation skills."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think it\u2019s really powerful to deconstruct empathy. This notion of mirroring, mentalizing, and caring are very helpful to understand these different dimensions. And I really appreciate sharing the ways that we can develop and recognize our own empathy by looking internally to see how we feel. But also trying to, as you said, get in the heads of others through literature, through watching and role playing, other interactions. These are things we can do to hone and develop empathy, which make us more available to connect with others. Next, what is involved from your perspective in terms of presence and content that makes for a true connected conversation?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"So, I asked conversation experts, this question, I got a whole bunch of tips I put in the book, I\u2019ll reel off a few of them."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"First regarding attention, treat attention as an on off switch, not a dimmer. So, when you\u2019re talking to somebody, it should be a hundred percent or zero percent. Don\u2019t try to 60 percent it and have 40 percent of your attention on your phone. Be a loud listener, I have a buddy when you\u2019re talking to him, it\u2019s like talking to a Pentecostal charismatic church, he\u2019s like, uh huh, yes, yeah, uh huh, amen, I preach, preach. I love talking to that guy. And some people are loud with their voices, some people are loud with their faces, they\u2019re emotionally reacting. And so, I love talking to those people."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Another tip is don\u2019t be a topper. If you tell me, you just had a horrible flight and you sat on the tarmac for two hours, my instinct is to say, Oh, I know exactly what you went through, I had a horrible flight a few months ago and I sat on the tarmac for four hours. And that sounds like I\u2019m trying to relate, but what I\u2019m really doing is saying, let\u2019s stop talking about you, let\u2019s talk about me, and my superior experiences. And so don\u2019t be a topper."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Another one is don\u2019t fear the pause. If I\u2019m talking at you and my comment is going to last 90 seconds, at what point have you stopped listening so you can think of what to say next? Probably about 45 seconds in. And so, if I\u2019m saying something important, let me talk, listen to me for my whole 90 seconds. Then hold up your hand and consider what I\u2019ve said, and then after eight seconds of thought, then you can respond, but don\u2019t fear the pause. These are some of the ways you can turn a beginning conversation into a really meaningful conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I also have had the pleasure of interviewing many conversational experts, and I really like the way you capture a lot of what they\u2019ve said in catchy phrases that are memorable. The loud listener is fantastic. We know that listening is critical but demonstrating that listening and engaging in that listening is great. And the notion that attention is 100 percent, or nothing rather than partial attention is so important. I see it in my students all the time that they\u2019re partially paying attention. And this notion of not topping, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of shifting and supporting responses in conversation. And supporting is so important in not topping off."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And even another one, the one I like is make them authors, not witnesses. So, when people are telling you a story about their life, they don\u2019t go into enough detail. And so, if you say, well, where was your boss sitting when she told you that, then suddenly they\u2019re going into detail."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I have a friend who\u2019s, his great skill is hiring people for his firms. And he has a method he calls, take me back. He says, when people talk about their lives, they don\u2019t start early enough. So, take me back to your childhood. And he hires for what he calls spirit of generosity. And so, he thinks we\u2019re all sort of who we were when we were in teenagers. And so, he says, take me back to high school. Who were you in high school? And how has that changed? And he says, you really get a sense of the persons, whether they have a spirit of generosity or whether they don\u2019t have a spirit of generosity."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You made me a little nervous thinking about who I am today versus who I was in high school, man. I don\u2019t know if I agree with your friend\u2019s perspective."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I don\u2019t either. I don\u2019t either, actually."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But no, I love that idea of asking questions to get more details and that\u2019s really important. So, David, let me ask you this way, take me back to a conversation you\u2019ve had, where you\u2019ve had the opportunity to be with an illuminator and a conversation where you\u2019ve been with a diminisher. I\u2019d love for you to help us understand those concepts in the context of conversation that you\u2019ve had."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Yeah. So, an illuminator is someone who makes you feel let up. They\u2019re curious about you, they ask a lot of questions. You just leave feeling that they really got you. And a diminisher is someone who doesn\u2019t ask questions, they\u2019re not curious about you. They just blather at you and you feel invisible. Am I even here? And so, the goal is to try to be more like an illuminator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Are there certain skills and behaviors that illuminators invoke to really help illuminate?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Yeah, I think a lot of it is, A, it\u2019s the focus of attention. B, it\u2019s the ability to be other centered. But C, maybe we could return to the art of asking questions. And so, I do think question is another moral act. Because when you\u2019re asking somebody a question, you\u2019re showing respect, you\u2019re showing curiosity, you\u2019re honoring them. And so, when you first know somebody, I like to ask questions that make them comfortable. And if I see they\u2019re proud of something, I\u2019ll ask them about that. If they\u2019re wearing a sports team jersey, I\u2019ll ask them about that. Or I often ask, where\u2019d you grow up? I travel a lot. So, I\u2019ve probably been to where they grew up and it\u2019s a good way to start a conversation. And then I\u2019ll sometimes say, where\u2019d you get your name? And that gets people talking about their ethnic heritage or their family background. And then as I get to know them better, you can ask slightly more personal questions. And so those are things like, tell me your favorite unimportant thing about you."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"But then as you get to know people, you can really have conversations that lift them out of the daily experience and get them to see themselves in new ways. And so those are questions like, and you have to have trust before you ask these questions, but it\u2019s like, if this five year is a chapter in your life, what\u2019s the chapter about? Or if we met a year from now, what would we be celebrating? Or what crossroads are you at? Most of us are at some transition moment in our lives. So what crossroads are you at right now? Or what talent do you have that you\u2019re not using? And these are all questions that get people to see themselves anew. And then suddenly you\u2019re having deeper conversations, the kind of conversations you\u2019re going to remember forever."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I was at a dinner party several months ago now, and I asked the group, how do your ancestors show up in your life? Like we\u2019re all formed by our ancestors, our ethnic heritage and our grandparents. And so that was a super fun conversation where we all just explored a topic together and learned about each other and ourselves."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m fascinated by the value of questions for discovery. What I hear in that is you have to think about the level of connection, trust, and respect you have before you ask certain questions. And that questions can really be gateways to discovery about ourselves and others that allow us to feel a sense of commonality and connection."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"David, I know you do a lot of public speaking and you\u2019ve certainly listened to a lot of public speakers. What advice do you have to be a better public speaker?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"If you want to know a couple of my rules on public speaking. One is you have to do a trust fall on the audience. Some people are too scared of the audience, and they don\u2019t do a trust fall. So, you have to fall on the audience, and if you show vulnerability before the audience, they will pick you up."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"The second rule of speaking is. The first five minutes when people sit down, the speech is just starting. Everybody\u2019s anxious. The speaker\u2019s anxious, but the audience is anxious because they don\u2019t know if the speaker\u2019s going to suck, and it\u2019ll be terrible. And so, if you can tell a few minutes of jokes in the top, everybody can relax, this is not going to suck, this guy knows what he\u2019s doing and then they will be relaxed for you."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And the final bit of advice, go on YouTube and watch a speech, any speech that is given by a guy named Bryan Stevenson. And Bryan Stevenson is famous for helping getting people out of jail, and he\u2019s led a wonderful morally focused life, I have great admiration. But just watch his speeches, you\u2019ll learn an important fact. There is no such thing as putting too many stories into a speech. His speeches are story, story, story, story, story, with very few points in between. But he gets the points across in the stories, so cram as many stories as you can."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And the way I do it is I look at how musicians do a rock concert. And I watch where they put the big songs in their repertoire that they put at the end, they put in the beginning. I\u2019m a big Bruce Springsteen guy, he\u2019s got a song called Badlands, which opens up the audience emotionally. And after you sing that song, it\u2019s kind of a call and response song, then you can really hit them with the big stuff because they\u2019ve been opened up emotionally. And so, story, story, story, and then hit them with the power and the power and the power at the end, and you\u2019ll be a great communicator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Bryan Stevenson is somebody that in my strategic communication class, we show his work and make the same point you do. That through story, you can move people and really communicate your points. The advice of a trust fall I really like. And not only can it be through humor, it can be through a disclosive story, some interactive activity you do with the audience, but very powerful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"In your op-ed writing, you often use stories among other devices to convey complex ideas and make your points more accessible. What advice would you give our listeners who find themselves needing to make their positions and arguments more memorable and relatable and persuasive, so that they can do a better job?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"There\u2019s a psychologist named Jerome Bruner who says there are two modes of thinking. There\u2019s paradigmatic mode and narrative mode, and paradigmatic mode is what most of us do at work. It\u2019s writing a strategy memo, it\u2019s writing a PowerPoint presentation, it\u2019s usually writing an op ed column or a legal brief, it\u2019s making an argument for something. And paradigmatic is a good way to think about things when you\u2019re making the case for some strategy."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Narrative mode is what you really need to understand another human being. You want them telling stories. And so, for example, when I, even as a political journalist, I no longer ask people, what do you believe? I ask people, how did you come to believe that? And that way, suddenly they\u2019re telling me a story of somebody who shaped their values. It\u2019s always best to go in chronological order. What happened? This happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that happened. And so that people naturally think and remember in narrative mode, not paradigmatic mode."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The advice to ask, how did you come to believe, is a phenomenal bit of advice to help people not just get stories from others, but to think about how to create their own stories that they tell for their information. And I thank you for that bit of advice."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"David, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask two questions of all of my guests that are the same and then I create a third question that\u2019s specific and unique to each person. So, are you up for answering these questions?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Let\u2019s go for it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"All right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So how did you come to believe that being a journalist was the right path for you?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"I read this book called Paddington the Bear at age seven, and I knew I wanted to become a writer. And I thought it was going to be a novelist, then I thought I wanted to be a playwright, and I was starting out trying to write fiction. I was a bartender for a year in Chicago. And then I got a job as a police reporter for the city news bureau of Chicago, which is a wire service. So, I was covering murders and crimes and rapes. And every day I came home with an amazing story. And so, I covered a lot of very stupid criminals, I covered one guy who was working at McDonald\u2019s, and he did an armed robbery at the work at the McDonald\u2019s he worked at. And so, they all looked at him and said, John, we know you don\u2019t rob your own McDonald\u2019s. And there was another group of guys who broke out of jail, got hungry and ate in a restaurant across the street from the jail and they ate in the window table, and so they were not the brightest. And so, it was just, I found that I could come home with a story, and I saw pieces of the world that I would never have seen otherwise. And so, I thought, well, journalism, that\u2019ll be fun. So, I did that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Question number two, who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"One of the ones is, frankly, Oprah. If you want to know how to be a good listener, watch an Oprah interview with a sound off. And what you\u2019ll see is her face reacting with every, like when people are saying something happy, she\u2019s like grunting little bits of approval. And when somebody is saying something sad, she gets this kind of silence that looks so forlorn. And so, she\u2019s just a great example of a listener."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oprah is definitely an amazing speaker and your advice to watch her with the sound turned off to see how she listens is great. I think we can all learn something by watching our own video and watching video of those that we respect with sound and without to learn."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My final question for you, David, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"First, you have to be singing out of your depths, not out of your shallows. And so, I\u2019d go to these concerts and sometimes I\u2019ll see a concert, I guess I\u2019ll mention a name, I went to a Sting concert not long ago. And the guy was just going through the motions, whereas Bruce Springsteen, to bring back my hero, he\u2019s never going through the motions. He\u2019s singing out of his depth, something he passionately cares about. And so, he might\u2019ve written the song in 1974, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s singing it for the first time. There\u2019s some things that come out of our depths and not out of our shallows."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"The second thing is it\u2019s just super helpful to be a little vulnerable. And so, I\u2019ll give you an example, a story. I was teaching, I teach at Yale for 20 years. And my, I held my office hours at a bar between 9, and 9PM and 1 in the morning. And one day, a woman who I\u2019d been courting was going to come to New Haven and tell me whether she was going to consent to marry me. And I didn\u2019t say all that to the students, I just said, I\u2019m going to have to cancel office hours. I just want you to know I\u2019m going through something."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And that night of the 24 students in the seminar, probably 18 sent me an email saying. Professor Brooks, I just want you to know I\u2019m thinking of you, uh, I\u2019m praying for you. And that whole, that little interchange, just that little hint of vulnerability, transformed the atmosphere in that class the whole term. Because suddenly I wasn\u2019t just Professor Brooks, I was just another schmo, trying to get through life, and so suddenly they could relate."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"And then the final thing I\u2019ll say is two of the writers I assigned to my students to learn how to write well are George Orwell and C. S. Lewis. And they were both English writers writing in the middle of the 20th century, but the key thing is they both wrote for radio. And so, they wrote, you had to be able to understand their sentences just hearing it, not reading it on a page. And so, they would never use a big word when a small word would do. They were just incredibly clear, and we want our writing to be incredibly clear. We think it\u2019s clear to us, but it\u2019s not clear. Writing and reading with that simplicity so they can overhear you if they just heard it on the radio and get it clear that\u2019s just super powerful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ve learned so many things from you in your answer to that. One, I should be holding my office hours in a bar. Second, that it\u2019s important to not only be passionate, as you mentioned, but to be vulnerable and to be very clear and focused in our language and reading out loud can be really helpful. When I read from my audio book, it was one of the most stressful, repetitive acts that I\u2019ve ever done."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"David, thank you so much, it was amazing to learn from you. You helped illuminate lots of important ideas. One of which that I\u2019m very much taking away is that we have to be humble in the presence of connecting with other people. We\u2019re not as good at listening as we think, we\u2019re not as empathetic as we think, and we can work to be better. And thank you for the specific bits of advice on what we can do. This has been incredibly useful and valuable. Thank you."},{"author":"David Brooks","text":"Thank you. I\u2019ve loved it.

I wrote it partially for reasons of personal salvation. I grew up in one of those homes where we were not too emotionally open. We were not a kind of home where you said I love you and did all that hugging stuff. And so, I grew up a kind of an aloof personality type. And I became a writer, which is also a very solitary profession."]},{"begin":"81.240","end":"104.680","lines":["And so my joke is in high school, I wanted to date this woman named Bernice and she didn\u2019t want to date me. She wanted to date somebody else. And I remember thinking, what is she thinking? I rate way better than that guy. And so those were my values, but they were not the normal values of society. So, I just wanted to become, you know, if you hide yourself off from the emotional intimacies of life, you\u2019re hiding yourself off from life itself and you\u2019re not going to be very effective in your job."]},{"begin":"104.680","end":"131.640","lines":["There was a study done by McKinsey where they asked CEOs, why do people leave your firm? And the CEO\u2019s number one answer was people leave our firm to make more money somewhere else. And then they asked the people who actually left, and their number one answer was, my manager didn\u2019t recognize me. And so human beings need recognition. They need to be seen, heard, and understood. There\u2019s nothing crueler than making somebody else feel invisible, feeling that you just don\u2019t get them."]},{"begin":"131.640","end":"162.240","lines":["And so if we\u2019re going to rebuild trust in our societies, if we\u2019re going to have decent politics in our societies.

I see the world a little from your point of view and you can trust me. And doing that is in part being open hearted. But partly it\u2019s a series of social skills.

Most of us are too busy performing ourselves and thinking about ourselves so we can\u2019t really think about a person. The second barrier is anxiety. We have too much going on in our minds that we can\u2019t really think about the other. The third barrier is we can\u2019t see that we\u2019re so stuck in our own worldview, we can\u2019t see from her point of view. And then finally, I think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t ask questions and the essential skill of getting to know another human being is being a great conversationalist and especially asking great questions."]},{"begin":"243.080","end":"268.600","lines":["I want to come back to one of the other barriers you talked about, this notion of worldview and then the other notion of our own ego. I really enjoyed learning about your view of empathy, which is something we talk a lot about on this podcast. You break the empathy down into a few components. Can you share those with us and provide us with some guidance on how to put them into action so we can be more empathetic?"]},{"begin":"268.600","end":"289.080","lines":["So, the first essence of developing good empathy is to understand you\u2019re wrong a lot of the time. And the second skill is mirroring. I\u2019m sitting with you and I\u2019m catching your emotions with my body. So, you\u2019re anxious or you\u2019re angry or you\u2019re sad. And I can feel it in my own body, I can just feel the emotion that\u2019s coming off you. And so that\u2019s called mirroring."]},{"begin":"289.080","end":"312.840","lines":["The second is called mentalizing. And that\u2019s the ability to theorize what you\u2019re probably going through based on my own experience. So, it\u2019s your first day on the job. And I used to have a first day on the job and I know that you\u2019re filled with anxiety, you\u2019re filled with joy, oh, this is going to be an exciting place to work. You\u2019re sort of overwhelmed, maybe you have imposter syndrome. So, I\u2019ve been through that, and I can know what you\u2019re going through. And that\u2019s called mentalizing."]},{"begin":"312.840","end":"342.960","lines":["The third stage of empathy is caring. And so, a con man is really good at knowing what other people are feeling, but we don\u2019t say they\u2019re empathetic because they don\u2019t care. And so, I need to be able to care effectively for you. And you can measure your own natural empathy skills by asking yourself some questions. Like, do people sometimes tell you go too far in driving home your point? Or do they, or do you feel comfortable showing up late to a meeting? If those are true of you, then you\u2019re probably have natural low empathy skills."]},{"begin":"342.960","end":"371.160","lines":["On the other hand, are social conflicts very painful for you? And then you probably have natural high empathy skills. But we can all get better. We can all get better with training. And some of the ways to get better is to read literature. You get inside the minds of other people, if you have a novel going at all times, you\u2019re just getting good at getting inside the mind of other people. Drama is a great way; the most empathetic people have done some role playing. And so those are two very concrete ways you can improve your empathy skills."]},{"begin":"371.160","end":"387.960","lines":["And then the final one is just getting really good at recognizing your own emotions, comfortable in your own body. And so, people who have gone to theaters, read literature, thought about their relationships, they can just spot the emotions of the people around them and hence much higher social observation skills."]},{"begin":"387.960","end":"432.360","lines":["I think it\u2019s really powerful to deconstruct empathy. This notion of mirroring, mentalizing, and caring are very helpful to understand these different dimensions. And I really appreciate sharing the ways that we can develop and recognize our own empathy by looking internally to see how we feel. But also trying to, as you said, get in the heads of others through literature, through watching and role playing, other interactions. These are things we can do to hone and develop empathy, which make us more available to connect with others. Next, what is involved from your perspective in terms of presence and content that makes for a true connected conversation?"]},{"begin":"432.360","end":"437.800","lines":["So, I asked conversation experts, this question, I got a whole bunch of tips I put in the book, I\u2019ll reel off a few of them."]},{"begin":"437.800","end":"469.440","lines":["First regarding attention, treat attention as an on off switch, not a dimmer. So, when you\u2019re talking to somebody, it should be a hundred percent or zero percent. Don\u2019t try to 60 percent it and have 40 percent of your attention on your phone. Be a loud listener, I have a buddy when you\u2019re talking to him, it\u2019s like talking to a Pentecostal charismatic church, he\u2019s like, uh huh, yes, yeah, uh huh, amen, I preach, preach. I love talking to that guy. And some people are loud with their voices, some people are loud with their faces, they\u2019re emotionally reacting. And so, I love talking to those people."]},{"begin":"469.440","end":"493.960","lines":["Another tip is don\u2019t be a topper. If you tell me, you just had a horrible flight and you sat on the tarmac for two hours, my instinct is to say, Oh, I know exactly what you went through, I had a horrible flight a few months ago and I sat on the tarmac for four hours. And that sounds like I\u2019m trying to relate, but what I\u2019m really doing is saying, let\u2019s stop talking about you, let\u2019s talk about me, and my superior experiences. And so don\u2019t be a topper."]},{"begin":"493.960","end":"526.800","lines":["Another one is don\u2019t fear the pause. If I\u2019m talking at you and my comment is going to last 90 seconds, at what point have you stopped listening so you can think of what to say next? Probably about 45 seconds in. And so, if I\u2019m saying something important, let me talk, listen to me for my whole 90 seconds. Then hold up your hand and consider what I\u2019ve said, and then after eight seconds of thought, then you can respond, but don\u2019t fear the pause. These are some of the ways you can turn a beginning conversation into a really meaningful conversation."]},{"begin":"526.800","end":"566.880","lines":["I also have had the pleasure of interviewing many conversational experts, and I really like the way you capture a lot of what they\u2019ve said in catchy phrases that are memorable. The loud listener is fantastic. We know that listening is critical but demonstrating that listening and engaging in that listening is great. And the notion that attention is 100 percent, or nothing rather than partial attention is so important. I see it in my students all the time that they\u2019re partially paying attention. And this notion of not topping, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of shifting and supporting responses in conversation.

B, it\u2019s the ability to be other centered. But C, maybe we could return to the art of asking questions. And so, I do think question is another moral act. Because when you\u2019re asking somebody a question, you\u2019re showing respect, you\u2019re showing curiosity, you\u2019re honoring them. And so, when you first know somebody, I like to ask questions that make them comfortable. And if I see they\u2019re proud of something, I\u2019ll ask them about that. If they\u2019re wearing a sports team jersey, I\u2019ll ask them about that. Or I often ask, where\u2019d you grow up? I travel a lot. So, I\u2019ve probably been to where they grew up and it\u2019s a good way to start a conversation. And then I\u2019ll sometimes say, where\u2019d you get your name? And that gets people talking about their ethnic heritage or their family background. And then as I get to know them better, you can ask slightly more personal questions.

Or if we met a year from now, what would we be celebrating? Or what crossroads are you at? Most of us are at some transition moment in our lives. So what crossroads are you at right now? Or what talent do you have that you\u2019re not using? And these are all questions that get people to see themselves anew.

One is you have to do a trust fall on the audience. Some people are too scared of the audience, and they don\u2019t do a trust fall.

And Bryan Stevenson is famous for helping getting people out of jail, and he\u2019s led a wonderful morally focused life, I have great admiration. But just watch his speeches, you\u2019ll learn an important fact. There is no such thing as putting too many stories into a speech. His speeches are story, story, story, story, story, with very few points in between.

And after you sing that song, it\u2019s kind of a call and response song, then you can really hit them with the big stuff because they\u2019ve been opened up emotionally.

And then I got a job as a police reporter for the city news bureau of Chicago, which is a wire service. So, I was covering murders and crimes and rapes. And every day I came home with an amazing story. And so, I covered a lot of very stupid criminals, I covered one guy who was working at McDonald\u2019s, and he did an armed robbery at the work at the McDonald\u2019s he worked at. And so, they all looked at him and said, John, we know you don\u2019t rob your own McDonald\u2019s. And there was another group of guys who broke out of jail, got hungry and ate in a restaurant across the street from the jail and they ate in the window table, and so they were not the brightest.

And the guy was just going through the motions, whereas Bruce Springsteen, to bring back my hero, he\u2019s never going through the motions. He\u2019s singing out of his depth, something he passionately cares about. And so, he might\u2019ve written the song in 1974, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s singing it for the first time.

And one day, a woman who I\u2019d been courting was going to come to New Haven and tell me whether she was going to consent to marry me.

And so, they wrote, you had to be able to understand their sentences just hearing it, not reading it on a page. And so, they would never use a big word when a small word would do. They were just incredibly clear, and we want our writing to be incredibly clear. We think it\u2019s clear to us, but it\u2019s not clear.
