My name is Matt Abrahams and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast. Today I look forward to speaking with Geoffrey Cohen. Geoff holds many appointments at Stanford. He is a professor of organizational studies in education and business at the Graduate School of Education. He\u2019s a professor of psychology and a lecturer in management. Geoff research focuses on applying research-based interventions to pressing social problems. He recently released a book called Belonging the Science of Creating Connection in Bridging Divides. Welcome, Geoff. Thanks for being here. I am really excited for our conversation."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Thank you, Matt, for having me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. Can you define what you mean by belonging?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Hmm. Well, it\u2019s a great question. I could go on at length, but let me give a quick answer. Belonging is the sense of being included and accepted by a larger group. It\u2019s that feeling we get when we feel like we\u2019re part of a larger whole that accepts us for who we are in the ideal state. So it\u2019s both a state, and a process, a noun and a verb."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And it seems like in both of those, both the noun and verb version, that there are lots of benefits that it confers on us. What are some of those? How does belonging help us?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Well, as human beings, we are fundamentally social creatures, and we\u2019ve evolved to kind of have a social orientation because we need each other to survive and to thrive. Otherwise, we\u2019re just highly vulnerable to predation and disease out there in the wild. And so the human species has evolved to go through life together, and that\u2019s actually what the word belonging means: to go together."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"And there\u2019s all kinds of benefits to joining together, right? We can solve common problems together. We can do together what as individuals we could only imagine doing. We\u2019re capable of great projects and products, but also in addition, down to our very biology, we crave connection when we don\u2019t have it, when we feel disconnected from the rest of humanity. This what\u2019s called a state of loneliness. It actually does biological damage. It\u2019s one of the most toxic environmental, social environmental factors out there to not have that sense of connection with other people does great biological damage and seems to be one of the major contributors to disease and mortality and early death."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"So I would say that the benefits to belonging are that we can together do more than we can as individuals, but also biologically, psychologically, that sense of connection is so woven into our DNA that if we don\u2019t have it, we suffer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Belonging and feeling connected sound like they\u2019re absolutely critical to just being human. And it sounds like from a benefit side, there are productivity benefits, but there are also psychological, relational benefits. And certainly there are biological challenges if you\u2019re lonely and not connected or feeling a sense of belonging. And I can only imagine that there are lots of mental consequences."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It strikes me that belonging can come in two different varieties, at least. There\u2019s a \u201cbig B\u201d belonging where we feel connected to others at a deep emotional and fundamental way as we do with our lifelong friends and family, but also a \u201clittle b\u201d belonging where we feel connection in a more superficial like way. For example, followers we have on social media that we\u2019ve never met, or someone who shares a birthday with us, or even somebody who likes the same sports teams as we do. Does a \u201clittle b\u201d belonging, help us in the same way as Big B belonging does."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Big B belonging is better."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I like the alliteration."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Big B belonging is better. I, you know, one of, in the Harvard study, for example, one of the big predictors of longevity are quality social connections, quality social relationships. It\u2019s as important, I think it\u2019s about the effect size is about choice, the effect size of having healthy diet or exercising, having good social connections, that sense of being accepted for who you are, that kind of authentic sense of connection that is, I think, very hard to get online through these very superficial \u201csmall b\u201d connections that we have online. That sense of being accepted for who we are, that authentic connection is really, really important. But also that sense of being of service to others, being someone who matters, who\u2019s important to other people to give, is to create love."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Those deep connections are so good for our health and well-being. So much so, that even if you do these little studies, my friend Sonja Lyubomirsky and Steve Cole and Barb Fredrickson have done these little studies where they just randomly assign people to create these more deep, deeper, or meaningful connections by doing acts of kindness throughout a couple weeks. So they instruct people to either do something good for yourself that you enjoy or do something that\u2019s helpful to other people, an act of kindness. Then they look at biological markers of inflammation and they find that inflammation is much lower among those people who engage in these acts of kindness of service to others. That\u2019s not the kind of thing we get online. I mean, I\u2019m not denying that that\u2019s possible, and I\u2019m not denying that people who have faced a lot of exclusion and who can\u2019t find their niche can find some sense of home online. That definitely happens. But I think too often the social media kind of relationships that we have are not high quality. They\u2019re voyeuristic often and performative often, and that doesn\u2019t have the same kinds of benefits for wellbeing and personal strength."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it sounds to me that that stockpiling followers and friends online might not be the best strategy. Having a few close, really intimate friends, if you will, is important. You\u2019ve already begun to, to shed some light into this, Geoff, and I\u2019d like to push you a little bit more, but what are some strategies and tactics we can use to build and enhance our sense of belonging and our personal relationships? And, and what role does communication play in in that?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"I\u2019ve already mentioned one of them, and that is giving. Being of service is one way to create a powerful sense of connection. There\u2019s research, for instance, on teenagers, adolescents and what benefits their sense of connection and helps their health and wellbeing. And one answer turns out to be volunteerism. Getting involved in volunteer activities where you\u2019re serving some pro-social service, pro-social cause bigger than yourself, that is very beneficial. That\u2019s one strategy is to engage in activities in which you are giving to others and being of service to others. And it\u2019s not something that I think comes naturally to us today in our era. We are often in committing these sort of what are known as affective forecasting errors. What we think is good for, for us in our connections isn\u2019t necessarily actually good for us in our connections. We think that often pursuing our own status and self-interest will bring us health and happiness."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"And it turns out that that\u2019s not nearly as impactful as doing good for others."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"In terms of communication, I think communication styles are, are really important for maintaining our relationships, being able to communicate in an effective way, such that we not only express our personal interests and preferences and desires, but are respectful of others. That\u2019s so important."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Just to give one example, I know that sounds like a platitude in the abstract, but just to give one example, one of my former students, Michael Schwalbe, did a, did a great study looking at the political divide, and he wanted to make that go smoother, such that liberals and conservatives could talk better with each other and more respectfully. And he found that most of the time that didn\u2019t go well. People were kind of resistant to the points of view of the other party, but he found that one little communication strategy had a big effect."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"And that was to use two words before you expressed your point of view or your position on a policy. And those two words were: I think. \u201cI think this person is better.\u201d This is from my point of view, this is my position. And he found that just using these sort of linguistic markers that create a sort of subjective space for someone else\u2019s point of view that say, \u201cHey, this is a sort of common space where we\u2019re trying to figure out together the best way to look at this issue.\u201d That that actually opened up the other side to learning more about people\u2019s own position, made the other side less likely to denigrate the person speaking and just created more curiosity and common ground. So that\u2019s just one example of how our communication can foster these kinds of connections, even in difficult conversations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like this notion of being in service of others, doing volunteering as a way to help you feel connected. I love linguistics and just using, \u201cI think\u201d makes you sound less definitive and it makes you sound more open to other points of view. And so I, I appreciate that as good advice and I think I should employ that more frequently."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So how can we, as colleagues and managers create more inclusive and welcoming communities to foster belonging? I believe you have a term you call situation crafting. And how would that play into this?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Situation Crafting refers to the art and the science of creating situations that are conducive to a sense of belonging and that bring out people\u2019s personal and collective best. And it\u2019s based on this insight from social psychology about the power of situations. So oftentimes when we\u2019re looking out there in the world, trying to figure out the causes of behavior, we blame people, we overestimate the importance of things like ability and character, these sort of internal traits. And we underestimate the importance of the situation. Like people may have some circumstance that we don\u2019t know about that\u2019s affecting how they\u2019re dealing. A lot of times students, for instance, act out in class because they\u2019re feeling uncertain about their belonging in school, uncertain about how they\u2019re seen. And it\u2019s not so much that they are troublemakers, but rather the situation of school creates this feeling of alienation in them that leads them to behave in these ways that are, that are just not, not healthy for themselves and, and for the, and for the school."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"So by changing the way we act, what we say, what we do, we can change situations for the better often, sometimes even in profound ways. For instance, Greg Walton and I did a little study where we were looking at how to create more belonging among students, college students, making the transition into college, which is often a time of huge belonging uncertainty where people are uncertain about whether they belong and whether they can find a home. And all we did, I\u2019m going to sort of simplify, is to share with those students the stories of senior students at their school. And these stories conveyed to them, \u201cyou know, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to college myself, and over time things got better.\u201d And what we found that was that over the course of two years, that that little experience closed the achievement gap between students of color and their white peers. By half students of color are often the ones who are experiencing stronger belonging uncertainty in college."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You also brought up as a great point of where communication comes in. Helping people craft stories that they can then share with others is, is important. And creating an environment where it\u2019s okay to share vulnerability can help as well. And I can imagine organizations could set up opportunities to get together like affiliation groups, et cetera, to invite people to come connect. So if there\u2019s a group of people at work who like to exercise, they could go for a run together. Or if they\u2019re people interested in learning about a new topic. As managers and colleagues, we can invite people in to feel that sense of belonging. Is that a reasonable thing to do?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"I think so. And I think our theories of what makes people happy don\u2019t often include that. And our theories of what makes workers and employees productive often don\u2019t include those little opportunities for seemingly meaningless connection. But it\u2019s not really meaningless. I would often find as a young professor that I could feel intense belonging, uncertainty when I was starting out. I really felt, you know, with all the silverbacks there at the university I wasn\u2019t sure if I belonged. And then, yet, I\u2019d be going to the copy room and bump into a student in my class and we\u2019d have a, a little conversation about the class or a reading and some I felt feel better, I\u2019d feel better, I\u2019d even feel more energized."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"And I think that\u2019s what these little, what social psychologists call passive contacts do. You meet at the water cooler when you join a little club to do something together like exercise or enjoy a hobby together. These things that we don\u2019t really have theories, good theories for explaining why they make people healthier, why they make people more productive, they actually really do matter. So I think you\u2019re absolutely right, and I think managers and leaders can create those opportunities for connection. And they can also just through inquiring about people\u2019s interests and values, asking good questions, \u201cI just want to get to know you better\u201d also create that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you for that. I think everybody can tick off that list of things they can do at work as managers, as colleagues, to really help people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to flip the coin a little bit here. When Robert Cialdini was a guest, we talked about ways people can use our deep connections with others and our sense of belonging and need to belong as a way to manipulate or to influence or persuade us. Which leads me to wonder: is there a dark side to belonging that we should be concerned about?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"You know, this issue comes up a lot. Belonging is a psychological need. We have a need to belong, which can be channeled into either good outcomes or bad. And I think too often it\u2019s exploited for bad outcomes. That need to belong, if we\u2019re not getting it, if we\u2019re not fulfilling our need to belong through work or through mainstream institutions or through our family, we become vulnerable to the appeals of hate groups, extremist groups. We become vulnerable to the views of our political tribes, just conforming to them out of a need to belong. I think what this means is that if we exist in a society where people aren\u2019t getting those sort of constructive channels for belonging at work, at home through their family and their schools, then they become vulnerable to these other much more destructive forces. And that\u2019s a big problem."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we started the podcast, we talked about, we played the name game since we had some overlap at Stanford. And I studied with Phil Zimbardo and he had a class on the psychology of mind control. And one aspect of that was around cults and how cults prey on people who feel disconnected and they provide opportunities for connection. And when I started teaching persuasion and influence on my own years later, I started a cult in my class to demonstrate this. And we started the Church of Chocolate Obsession \u201cCocoa,\u201d and I was Brother Kara. We read from the Holy Truffle. I mean, it was this whole thing. But the point was to show to students how very quickly in the matter of a 20 minute class activity, we were able to create a sense of belonging to something that was completely ludicrous. Hershey kisses and Godiva bars. But the point is that sense of belonging is strong and can be manipulated. And I think you highlighted the downside potentially of it."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Yeah. It\u2019s easy to be manipulated."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Geoff, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. Here we go. Question one: If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Listen to people\u2019s hearts, not heads."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay. Listen to their hearts, not heads. So talk to me about listening to people\u2019s hearts. What does that mean and what does that look like?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Oftentimes when we get in these conflicts with people who engage in behavior that we find objectionable, the underlying causes are emotional issues. They\u2019re emotional issues and what people are saying their points of view, their opinions don\u2019t, you know, but they\u2019re often reflections of these underlying emotional issues and concerns such as not quite feeling like one belongs. And some of the examples that I gave to you earlier, such as a student in school who acts out, that might seem like, that might seem like the kid just has really bad attitudes, these, or beliefs about how they should be in school, something in their head, but actually it\u2019s something in their heart. They\u2019re not quite feeling like they fit in in school. And so a good teacher, a good educator, listens to that and understands that, you know, just like me, I can just like myself, I can act in regrettable ways when I\u2019m not quite feeling at home. And so that\u2019s what I think listening to people\u2019s hearts means."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like the way you phrase that. I mean, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s operationalized empathy, right? It\u2019s really tuning in to what you\u2019re seeing and experiencing, not just what you\u2019re hearing. So thank you. Question number two: Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Marshall Rosenberg"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tell me more."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"A psychologist who passed away, and he was actually the originator of that quote, which I distill down to seven words. He was like a Jedi master of listening, and he would say he would have these very difficult conversations with people from a wide, not only with different political beliefs, but people who are highly prejudiced bigots. And you just try to talk to them and listen. And people are like, \u201chow could you do this?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cyou know, I have just learned that I really can maintain my love for people and enjoy life a lot better if I listen to what\u2019s in their hearts. Not so much, not pay so much attention to what\u2019s in their heads.\u201d"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"So he has this technique of nonviolent communication in which you begin. If you have some problem with someone, you begin with an emotion. You know, \u201cI feel disrespected, I feel upset, I feel angry when, when you do this,\u201d when for instance, you leave the dishes in the sink and you don\u2019t clean up because I have a high need, psychological need to be respected. Too often we don\u2019t begin with our emotions. Instead we just try to control the other person. And this method of nonviolent communication is something that really stuck with me, in which you just begin with what you\u2019re feeling and you explain how what you\u2019re feeling derives from the psychological need. And it\u2019s then that you make an ask for a change in behavior. So he\u2019s one person that really stuck with me as a master communicator and listener."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And that\u2019s exactly what I was going to point out. I asked the question about a communicator and you went to somebody who, who starts communication by listening. And that\u2019s often forgotten, right? We often think about the words people speak or write or sing. And in fact, listening is, is a super powerful if not more powerful way to communicate. At first, let me ask you question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"As you said, listening, doing what social psychologists call perspective getting, which is asking good questions and listening to the answers. And then communicating your point of view respectfully using some of these linguistic markers that indicate this is my first-person point of view. So I think that those three ingredients are really crucial. Listening to the other person, listening to what\u2019s in the heart, not so much what\u2019s in the head, asking questions that dig a little bit deeper so that you get people\u2019s perspective rather than assume it. And then after that\u2019s done, providing your point of view in this sort of respectful way that makes it clear that this is your first-person point of view."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really find that process helpful. Listen, inquire and then share from your own perspective your response and taken together that is a good recipe and series of steps that we could all benefit from. So, Jeff, this has been a fantastic conversation. This notion of connecting and belonging are critical. Communication plays a central role in that. And your best practices and specific references to research and ways that we can work to foster belonging and connection are really important. Thank you for your time and thank you for your advice."},{"author":"Geoffrey Cohen","text":"Thank you Matt, for a wonderful conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve been listening to another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast, a production of Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Can you define what you mean by belonging?"]},{"begin":"67.200","end":"92.880","lines":["Hmm. Well, it\u2019s a great question. I could go on at length, but let me give a quick answer. Belonging is the sense of being included and accepted by a larger group. It\u2019s that feeling we get when we feel like we\u2019re part of a larger whole that accepts us for who we are in the ideal state. So it\u2019s both a state, and a process, a noun and a verb."]},{"begin":"92.880","end":"102.520","lines":["And it seems like in both of those, both the noun and verb version, that there are lots of benefits that it confers on us. What are some of those? How does belonging help us?"]},{"begin":"102.520","end":"128.520","lines":["Well, as human beings, we are fundamentally social creatures, and we\u2019ve evolved to kind of have a social orientation because we need each other to survive and to thrive. Otherwise, we\u2019re just highly vulnerable to predation and disease out there in the wild. And so the human species has evolved to go through life together, and that\u2019s actually what the word belonging means: to go together."]},{"begin":"128.520","end":"173.040","lines":["And there\u2019s all kinds of benefits to joining together, right? We can solve common problems together. We can do together what as individuals we could only imagine doing. We\u2019re capable of great projects and products, but also in addition, down to our very biology, we crave connection when we don\u2019t have it, when we feel disconnected from the rest of humanity. This what\u2019s called a state of loneliness. It actually does biological damage. It\u2019s one of the most toxic environmental, social environmental factors out there to not have that sense of connection with other people does great biological damage and seems to be one of the major contributors to disease and mortality and early death."]},{"begin":"173.040","end":"188.160","lines":["So I would say that the benefits to belonging are that we can together do more than we can as individuals, but also biologically, psychologically, that sense of connection is so woven into our DNA that if we don\u2019t have it, we suffer."]},{"begin":"188.160","end":"213.640","lines":["Belonging and feeling connected sound like they\u2019re absolutely critical to just being human. And it sounds like from a benefit side, there are productivity benefits, but there are also psychological, relational benefits. And certainly there are biological challenges if you\u2019re lonely and not connected or feeling a sense of belonging. And I can only imagine that there are lots of mental consequences."]},{"begin":"213.640","end":"246.440","lines":["It strikes me that belonging can come in two different varieties, at least. There\u2019s a \u201cbig B\u201d belonging where we feel connected to others at a deep emotional and fundamental way as we do with our lifelong friends and family, but also a \u201clittle b\u201d belonging where we feel connection in a more superficial like way. For example, followers we have on social media that we\u2019ve never met, or someone who shares a birthday with us, or even somebody who likes the same sports teams as we do. Does a \u201clittle b\u201d belonging, help us in the same way as Big B belonging does."]},{"begin":"246.440","end":"249.560","lines":["Big B belonging is better."]},{"begin":"249.560","end":"251.040","lines":["I like the alliteration."]},{"begin":"251.040","end":"299.360","lines":["Big B belonging is better. I, you know, one of, in the Harvard study, for example, one of the big predictors of longevity are quality social connections, quality social relationships. It\u2019s as important, I think it\u2019s about the effect size is about choice, the effect size of having healthy diet or exercising, having good social connections, that sense of being accepted for who you are, that kind of authentic sense of connection that is, I think, very hard to get online through these very superficial \u201csmall b\u201d connections that we have online. That sense of being accepted for who we are, that authentic connection is really, really important. But also that sense of being of service to others, being someone who matters, who\u2019s important to other people to give, is to create love."]},{"begin":"299.360","end":"365.040","lines":["Those deep connections are so good for our health and well-being. So much so, that even if you do these little studies, my friend Sonja Lyubomirsky and Steve Cole and Barb Fredrickson have done these little studies where they just randomly assign people to create these more deep, deeper, or meaningful connections by doing acts of kindness throughout a couple weeks. So they instruct people to either do something good for yourself that you enjoy or do something that\u2019s helpful to other people, an act of kindness. Then they look at biological markers of inflammation and they find that inflammation is much lower among those people who engage in these acts of kindness of service to others. That\u2019s not the kind of thing we get online. I mean, I\u2019m not denying that that\u2019s possible, and I\u2019m not denying that people who have faced a lot of exclusion and who can\u2019t find their niche can find some sense of home online. That definitely happens. But I think too often the social media kind of relationships that we have are not high quality. They\u2019re voyeuristic often and performative often, and that doesn\u2019t have the same kinds of benefits for wellbeing and personal strength."]},{"begin":"365.040","end":"391.680","lines":["So it sounds to me that that stockpiling followers and friends online might not be the best strategy. Having a few close, really intimate friends, if you will, is important. You\u2019ve already begun to, to shed some light into this, Geoff, and I\u2019d like to push you a little bit more, but what are some strategies and tactics we can use to build and enhance our sense of belonging and our personal relationships? And, and what role does communication play in in that?"]},{"begin":"391.680","end":"452.720","lines":["I\u2019ve already mentioned one of them, and that is giving. Being of service is one way to create a powerful sense of connection. There\u2019s research, for instance, on teenagers, adolescents and what benefits their sense of connection and helps their health and wellbeing. And one answer turns out to be volunteerism. Getting involved in volunteer activities where you\u2019re serving some pro-social service, pro-social cause bigger than yourself, that is very beneficial. That\u2019s one strategy is to engage in activities in which you are giving to others and being of service to others. And it\u2019s not something that I think comes naturally to us today in our era. We are often in committing these sort of what are known as affective forecasting errors. What we think is good for, for us in our connections isn\u2019t necessarily actually good for us in our connections. We think that often pursuing our own status and self-interest will bring us health and happiness."]},{"begin":"452.720","end":"458.560","lines":["And it turns out that that\u2019s not nearly as impactful as doing good for others."]},{"begin":"458.560","end":"479.160","lines":["In terms of communication, I think communication styles are, are really important for maintaining our relationships, being able to communicate in an effective way, such that we not only express our personal interests and preferences and desires, but are respectful of others. That\u2019s so important."]},{"begin":"479.160","end":"505.920","lines":["Just to give one example, I know that sounds like a platitude in the abstract, but just to give one example, one of my former students, Michael Schwalbe, did a, did a great study looking at the political divide, and he wanted to make that go smoother, such that liberals and conservatives could talk better with each other and more respectfully. And he found that most of the time that didn\u2019t go well. People were kind of resistant to the points of view of the other party, but he found that one little communication strategy had a big effect."]},{"begin":"505.920","end":"556.680","lines":["And that was to use two words before you expressed your point of view or your position on a policy. And those two words were: I think. \u201cI think this person is better.\u201d This is from my point of view, this is my position. And he found that just using these sort of linguistic markers that create a sort of subjective space for someone else\u2019s point of view that say, \u201cHey, this is a sort of common space where we\u2019re trying to figure out together the best way to look at this issue.\u201d That that actually opened up the other side to learning more about people\u2019s own position, made the other side less likely to denigrate the person speaking and just created more curiosity and common ground. So that\u2019s just one example of how our communication can foster these kinds of connections, even in difficult conversations."]},{"begin":"556.680","end":"582.160","lines":["I really like this notion of being in service of others, doing volunteering as a way to help you feel connected. I love linguistics and just using, \u201cI think\u201d makes you sound less definitive and it makes you sound more open to other points of view. And so I, I appreciate that as good advice and I think I should employ that more frequently."]},{"begin":"582.160","end":"595.280","lines":["So how can we, as colleagues and managers create more inclusive and welcoming communities to foster belonging? I believe you have a term you call situation crafting. And how would that play into this?"]},{"begin":"595.280","end":"659.640","lines":["Situation Crafting refers to the art and the science of creating situations that are conducive to a sense of belonging and that bring out people\u2019s personal and collective best. And it\u2019s based on this insight from social psychology about the power of situations. So oftentimes when we\u2019re looking out there in the world, trying to figure out the causes of behavior, we blame people, we overestimate the importance of things like ability and character, these sort of internal traits. And we underestimate the importance of the situation. Like people may have some circumstance that we don\u2019t know about that\u2019s affecting how they\u2019re dealing. A lot of times students, for instance, act out in class because they\u2019re feeling uncertain about their belonging in school, uncertain about how they\u2019re seen. And it\u2019s not so much that they are troublemakers, but rather the situation of school creates this feeling of alienation in them that leads them to behave in these ways that are, that are just not, not healthy for themselves and, and for the, and for the school."]},{"begin":"659.640","end":"720.560","lines":["So by changing the way we act, what we say, what we do, we can change situations for the better often, sometimes even in profound ways. For instance, Greg Walton and I did a little study where we were looking at how to create more belonging among students, college students, making the transition into college, which is often a time of huge belonging uncertainty where people are uncertain about whether they belong and whether they can find a home. And all we did, I\u2019m going to sort of simplify, is to share with those students the stories of senior students at their school. And these stories conveyed to them, \u201cyou know, I had a lot of trouble adjusting to college myself, and over time things got better.\u201d And what we found that was that over the course of two years, that that little experience closed the achievement gap between students of color and their white peers. By half students of color are often the ones who are experiencing stronger belonging uncertainty in college."]},{"begin":"720.560","end":"760.400","lines":["You also brought up as a great point of where communication comes in. Helping people craft stories that they can then share with others is, is important. And creating an environment where it\u2019s okay to share vulnerability can help as well. And I can imagine organizations could set up opportunities to get together like affiliation groups, et cetera, to invite people to come connect. So if there\u2019s a group of people at work who like to exercise, they could go for a run together. Or if they\u2019re people interested in learning about a new topic. As managers and colleagues, we can invite people in to feel that sense of belonging. Is that a reasonable thing to do?"]},{"begin":"760.400","end":"806.240","lines":["I think so. And I think our theories of what makes people happy don\u2019t often include that. And our theories of what makes workers and employees productive often don\u2019t include those little opportunities for seemingly meaningless connection. But it\u2019s not really meaningless. I would often find as a young professor that I could feel intense belonging, uncertainty when I was starting out. I really felt, you know, with all the silverbacks there at the university I wasn\u2019t sure if I belonged. And then, yet, I\u2019d be going to the copy room and bump into a student in my class and we\u2019d have a, a little conversation about the class or a reading and some I felt feel better, I\u2019d feel better, I\u2019d even feel more energized."]},{"begin":"806.240","end":"843.400","lines":["And I think that\u2019s what these little, what social psychologists call passive contacts do. You meet at the water cooler when you join a little club to do something together like exercise or enjoy a hobby together. These things that we don\u2019t really have theories, good theories for explaining why they make people healthier, why they make people more productive, they actually really do matter. So I think you\u2019re absolutely right, and I think managers and leaders can create those opportunities for connection. And they can also just through inquiring about people\u2019s interests and values, asking good questions, \u201cI just want to get to know you better\u201d also create that."]},{"begin":"843.400","end":"852.200","lines":["Thank you for that. I think everybody can tick off that list of things they can do at work as managers, as colleagues, to really help people."]},{"begin":"852.200","end":"872.760","lines":["I want to flip the coin a little bit here. When Robert Cialdini was a guest, we talked about ways people can use our deep connections with others and our sense of belonging and need to belong as a way to manipulate or to influence or persuade us. Which leads me to wonder: is there a dark side to belonging that we should be concerned about?"]},{"begin":"872.760","end":"926.840","lines":["You know, this issue comes up a lot. Belonging is a psychological need. We have a need to belong, which can be channeled into either good outcomes or bad. And I think too often it\u2019s exploited for bad outcomes. That need to belong, if we\u2019re not getting it, if we\u2019re not fulfilling our need to belong through work or through mainstream institutions or through our family, we become vulnerable to the appeals of hate groups, extremist groups. We become vulnerable to the views of our political tribes, just conforming to them out of a need to belong. I think what this means is that if we exist in a society where people aren\u2019t getting those sort of constructive channels for belonging at work, at home through their family and their schools, then they become vulnerable to these other much more destructive forces. And that\u2019s a big problem."]},{"begin":"926.840","end":"982.720","lines":["Before we started the podcast, we talked about, we played the name game since we had some overlap at Stanford. And I studied with Phil Zimbardo and he had a class on the psychology of mind control. And one aspect of that was around cults and how cults prey on people who feel disconnected and they provide opportunities for connection. And when I started teaching persuasion and influence on my own years later, I started a cult in my class to demonstrate this. And we started the Church of Chocolate Obsession \u201cCocoa,\u201d and I was Brother Kara. We read from the Holy Truffle. I mean, it was this whole thing. But the point was to show to students how very quickly in the matter of a 20 minute class activity, we were able to create a sense of belonging to something that was completely ludicrous. Hershey kisses and Godiva bars. But the point is that sense of belonging is strong and can be manipulated. And I think you highlighted the downside potentially of it."]},{"begin":"982.720","end":"985.280","lines":["Yeah. It\u2019s easy to be manipulated."]},{"begin":"985.280","end":"991.440","lines":["So Geoff, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"991.440","end":"992.240","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"992.240","end":"1004.560","lines":["Excellent. Here we go. Question one: If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"1004.560","end":"1007.920","lines":["Listen to people\u2019s hearts, not heads."]},{"begin":"1007.920","end":"1015.720","lines":["Okay. Listen to their hearts, not heads. So talk to me about listening to people\u2019s hearts. What does that mean and what does that look like?"]},{"begin":"1015.720","end":"1080.960","lines":["Oftentimes when we get in these conflicts with people who engage in behavior that we find objectionable, the underlying causes are emotional issues. They\u2019re emotional issues and what people are saying their points of view, their opinions don\u2019t, you know, but they\u2019re often reflections of these underlying emotional issues and concerns such as not quite feeling like one belongs. And some of the examples that I gave to you earlier, such as a student in school who acts out, that might seem like, that might seem like the kid just has really bad attitudes, these, or beliefs about how they should be in school, something in their head, but actually it\u2019s something in their heart. They\u2019re not quite feeling like they fit in in school. And so a good teacher, a good educator, listens to that and understands that, you know, just like me, I can just like myself, I can act in regrettable ways when I\u2019m not quite feeling at home. And so that\u2019s what I think listening to people\u2019s hearts means."]},{"begin":"1080.960","end":"1100.760","lines":["I really like the way you phrase that. I mean, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s operationalized empathy, right? It\u2019s really tuning in to what you\u2019re seeing and experiencing, not just what you\u2019re hearing. So thank you. Question number two: Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1100.760","end":"1101.920","lines":["Marshall Rosenberg"]},{"begin":"1101.920","end":"1103.520","lines":["Tell me more."]},{"begin":"1103.520","end":"1142.760","lines":["A psychologist who passed away, and he was actually the originator of that quote, which I distill down to seven words. He was like a Jedi master of listening, and he would say he would have these very difficult conversations with people from a wide, not only with different political beliefs, but people who are highly prejudiced bigots. And you just try to talk to them and listen. And people are like, \u201chow could you do this?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cyou know, I have just learned that I really can maintain my love for people and enjoy life a lot better if I listen to what\u2019s in their hearts. Not so much, not pay so much attention to what\u2019s in their heads.\u201d"]},{"begin":"1142.760","end":"1197.040","lines":["So he has this technique of nonviolent communication in which you begin. If you have some problem with someone, you begin with an emotion. You know, \u201cI feel disrespected, I feel upset, I feel angry when, when you do this,\u201d when for instance, you leave the dishes in the sink and you don\u2019t clean up because I have a high need, psychological need to be respected. Too often we don\u2019t begin with our emotions. Instead we just try to control the other person. And this method of nonviolent communication is something that really stuck with me, in which you just begin with what you\u2019re feeling and you explain how what you\u2019re feeling derives from the psychological need. And it\u2019s then that you make an ask for a change in behavior. So he\u2019s one person that really stuck with me as a master communicator and listener."]},{"begin":"1197.040","end":"1226.000","lines":["And that\u2019s exactly what I was going to point out. I asked the question about a communicator and you went to somebody who, who starts communication by listening. And that\u2019s often forgotten, right? We often think about the words people speak or write or sing. And in fact, listening is, is a super powerful if not more powerful way to communicate. At first, let me ask you question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1226.000","end":"1273.160","lines":["As you said, listening, doing what social psychologists call perspective getting, which is asking good questions and listening to the answers. And then communicating your point of view respectfully using some of these linguistic markers that indicate this is my first-person point of view. So I think that those three ingredients are really crucial. Listening to the other person, listening to what\u2019s in the heart, not so much what\u2019s in the head, asking questions that dig a little bit deeper so that you get people\u2019s perspective rather than assume it. And then after that\u2019s done, providing your point of view in this sort of respectful way that makes it clear that this is your first-person point of view."]},{"begin":"1273.160","end":"1313.280","lines":["I really find that process helpful. Listen, inquire and then share from your own perspective your response and taken together that is a good recipe and series of steps that we could all benefit from. So, Jeff, this has been a fantastic conversation. This notion of connecting and belonging are critical. Communication plays a central role in that. And your best practices and specific references to research and ways that we can work to foster belonging and connection are really important.
