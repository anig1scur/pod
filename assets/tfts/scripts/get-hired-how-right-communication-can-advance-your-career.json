According to Seaman, getting opportunities isn't just about experience or connections, but how we frame and present our personal and professional narratives. With a standard resume, he says, \u201cYou're making them connect the dots. And people are not good at that.\u201d Instead, he recommends crafting a story that explains where you've been, where you are, and where you hope to go. \u201cConnect the dots for them,\u201d he says, \u201cso they're not viewing you as a person who has bounced around. They're thinking, \u2018This person has had a cohesive career.'\u201d"],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"When it comes to our careers, we need to be very strategic and thoughtful. And it starts with our presence, through the job interview, well beyond. My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am super excited today to be joined by Andrew Seaman. Andrew is the Senior Managing Editor for Jobs and Career Development at LinkedIn. Andrew oversees a team of journalists and editors at LinkedIn who are focused on helping people navigate work and life. Through his Get Hired podcast and newsletter, Andrew has helped thousands of people get jobs and advance in their careers. Andrew and I first met when he kindly hosted me on his podcast. Since then, we\u2019ve found lots of areas in common and we\u2019ve found ways to collaborate."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Andrew. It\u2019s great to be with you in person once again."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:00:55]: Yeah, thank you for hosting me. It\u2019s great to be here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:00:57]: Unlike our typical Think Fast, Talk Smart podcast episodes where I get to ask the questions, Andrew and I are going to share both asking and answering duties today. We hope to share some immediately useful practical and tactical advice to help our combined listeners in their careers. We\u2019ve identified a number of topics and we\u2019ll be discussing them with each other and with you. So let\u2019s get started, Andrew. I\u2019d like to talk a bit about online presence. How important is our online presence and how can we maximize our LinkedIn profile and presence through posting on LinkedIn?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"Online presence is your first interview. So what I always tell people is post what you\u2019re reading about your profession, post what you\u2019re passionate about, and add to that conversation because it\u2019s a way for people to get to know you before they actually meet you. And it\u2019s a way for them to keep up with you too. So I think it\u2019s hugely important and I encourage it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:01:52]: I think that\u2019s really important to think about curating your profile and social presence based on the fact that people might be looking at that way before they meet you. And beyond LinkedIn, I\u2019m sure different industries and different organizations have groups that they can be posting to."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Do you have a recommendation for how frequently one should post? The types of things? Do we reveal information about our hobbies and interests beyond work? What do you think in that regard?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:02:17]: There are a lot of people who I think share too much. One thing that I always tell people, and they\u2019re surprised when I tell them this, is that I like to quilt and sew. And I know that sounds really strange, but it\u2019s very meditative for me. But I don\u2019t want to be known as a quilter. I don\u2019t want to make it a hobby where I\u2019m posting on Instagram or things like that. So I don\u2019t really talk about it. I don\u2019t post about it that much, you know, it\u2019s just because that\u2019s for me. So I recommend people posting regularly, but almost as a challenge to yourself."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So think about it like at least three times a week. And look at what other people in your industry are talking about or maybe areas that you\u2019re passionate about. So, you know, we\u2019re here at Stanford. And everyone\u2019s on a bicycle. So if you care about sort of creating bikeable cities or something like that, that might not be your profession, but if you\u2019re passionate about it, you could post about that too."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"And that way when people see you and see your profile, they know, okay, this person is a rounded individual. That they have their instructional knowledge where they\u2019re a professor or, you know, maybe they\u2019re an engineer or something, but then they also have this other thing that they\u2019re passionate about and they get to see you for who you are completely."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So you know, a few times a week, make it a mix of what you care about, whether it\u2019s profession or not. And then also, you know, a lot of times now when I look at someone\u2019s profile, I skip their experience section and I just look at their activity. Because it tells me more what\u2019s on their mind now than what they did five years ago at a different company."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:03:41]: The listeners know I\u2019m a big martial artist and I kept that quiet for a long time. And when I started sharing it more frequently on social media, it actually helped me connect with a whole bunch of people in a very different way. And it started a lot of interesting conversations. So I think you have to make a decision about how much you want to reveal about yourself."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One last question on this online presence, what\u2019s your take on commenting on other people\u2019s posts versus just posting yourself? Is there a difference when you as a hiring manager, from your position, make recommendations around that?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:04:11]: What I tell people is, are you adding value to the conversation? I think it was my math teacher, and I don\u2019t know why he had this sign in his room, like, seventh grade, like, algebra teacher, and he had a sign that had Charlie Brown on it, and it said, are you listening or are you waiting to talk? I was usually always waiting to talk, but one thing that I just always thought is like, am I actually moving this conversation forward?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So when I read comments and it\u2019s like, yes, plus one, that doesn\u2019t really do anything for me, but if someone says, you know what, I agree with this but, and they can add something really substantial or a good caveat, I think that\u2019s really where the value comes in. So when you\u2019re going to comment something, just think, is this actually adding to the conversation?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"I do recommend commenting because some people, they find it scary to post and usually it\u2019s almost like putting a comment is a little bit of a lighter lift and a little bit less scary. So if you don\u2019t want to post right now, try commenting, but make sure you\u2019re actually moving the conversation forward."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:05:07]: I think that\u2019s great advice in all communication, is to just move things forward, which I think we should do now."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So, I wanted to ask you about interview presence because I know a lot of people, they go into an interview, and they show up and they\u2019re the deer in headlights. What do you think is important and best practice for interview presence, whether it be in person or virtual?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:05:29]: Yeah, so presence in terms of how you show up for an interview matters a lot. People are forming opinions of you even before you log into the Zoom or walk into the room. And so you really have to think about what is it I want to display. So what\u2019s the timeliness of my responses? What information am I sharing? Am I doing it properly? I once as a hiring manager, I shared this story with you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Somebody sent me their cover letter and they said they were detail oriented and they spelled detail wrong, right? I\u2019m forming impressions about them before they ever walk in the door. So your presence matters and it\u2019s everything that happens from the moment you connect and contact the company all the way through the whole interaction."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:06:10] I\u2019ll give you another example. When I was a hiring manager. I sat in a place where I actually could look out a window and there was somebody who was coming to interview with me, and he was clearly running late. He came into the parking lot, cut somebody off to get a space, runs in, was very rude to the receptionist, and then comes and does an amazing interview with me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, who was that person? Was it the person who interviewed with me perfectly, or was it the person who treated people rudely? The person did not end up getting the job. But his presence was known way before he walked into the room. So we have to think about who we want to project ourselves as and we have to be consistent throughout all of our interactions with the company."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now I\u2019m certainly not saying be disingenuous and not be who you truly are. But we have to think about it. Most of us just think that I\u2019m being interviewed when I\u2019m in the moment of being interviewed and it happens way before that."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:06:59]: And something that I\u2019m curious about too is, I think if you have a bad interview answer, you can sometimes recover, but I\u2019m not sure you can recover from a bad impression. And do you think there\u2019s a way to salvage that?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:07:11]: Yeah, I think it\u2019s challenging, but I think it\u2019s possible and appropriate at times to say in a follow up, interaction that, you know, I wasn\u2019t at my best last time. Here\u2019s what I would\u2019ve liked to think about or have said. I also think it\u2019s important after you have an interview, \u2018cause not every question do you hit and nail the answer the way you want. I think in a, in a follow-up, thank you email, you can do some damage control or correcting, as needed. But we need to be thinking about our presence. I mean, the question you asked is predicated on being aware enough to know that things didn\u2019t hit. And a lot of people are just so glad that the interview\u2019s over that they don\u2019t really think about what they might want to correct, and then think about the best way to do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:07:48] I\u2019d love to ask you, Andrew, about interviewing from the interviewer\u2019s perspective. Many of our listeners are in a position of hiring people. What kind of insight and advice do you have for those who are doing the interviewing? Because interviewing is actually a skill. You do it very well on your podcast. What are some advice you give to those who are the interviewer?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:08:06]: Hiring managers are rarely taught how to interview people. So it\u2019s one of those things where I don\u2019t give them a pass, because if you are a hiring manager, I think you need to have some skill in talking to people to vet them and see if they\u2019re a good fit. But I understand that a lot of companies don\u2019t even really train people. They might say, oh, here\u2019s a video to watch beforehand. But for interviewers, I think the main thing is that there\u2019s really no excuse to go into a meeting unprepared because it is a very life altering decision for the person who you\u2019re having a conversation with."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So go in there at least with, I think, three things that you want to assess that person on. And the first is obviously just getting to know them. You know, how do they interact with the environment? How do they interact with you? What has been their experience? Why do you want this job? Why do you want to work at this employer? So go in there with a game plan and try to figure out if this person can do the job, can they do it well. And then the other thing is, to make sure it is a conversation. Because I think a lot of hiring managers, they try and explain what the job is. It may be something from the job description that they\u2019ve already read. So make sure there\u2019s a back and forth, otherwise you\u2019re just wasting everyone\u2019s time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:09:22]: Yeah, that\u2019s critical to do some pre thinking about what is it you want to assess. I think there\u2019s some other things to be thinking about as an interviewer. One is, if this is the ideal candidate, the interview can serve as the beginning of your onboarding, right? You have the opportunity to set expectations and goals and norms. You can also be sensing where this person will fit, and who and how they will best learn to ramp them up to be most effective most quickly. So really seeing it as something that can serve a purpose beyond assessing is this a qualified candidate, I think makes a lot of sense."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And, you know, listening I think is the critical part as an interviewer. Listening to what is said, listening to what is not said. I always try, when I\u2019m interviewing, to be thinking about what\u2019s a good follow up question to give me more insight and to demonstrate that I really heard what the person was saying. Sometimes what I would do as an interviewer, and I\u2019d love to get your opinion on this, I often will challenge an interviewee to help me connect their answer to how they think that will play out in the job. Because a lot of people just give me information and I\u2019m looking, how does that information relate to the job. And it gives me a good assessment of if they\u2019ve done their homework."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"What do you think is appropriate as an interviewer to, to be a little challenging, to push on some of those answers? Is that appropriate? Not appropriate? What do you think?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:10:34]: I think it\u2019s appropriate to push as much as you need to assess their abilities. And what I\u2019m looking for when I talk to people is, how they\u2019re drawing from what they have done to apply to what they are doing now. I don\u2019t expect them to have all the answers, but I expect them to say, oh, I did X and that can get me to Y. But from an interviewer\u2019s perspective, yeah, I think you should be able to push. And also, I think you can warm the water a little bit by giving them an example. By saying, in the past I worked at this company, and when I came here, I did this."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"So it\u2019s almost like you are showing them the blueprint for answering the question, and it makes it a little bit more fair. So that way, in case that person, maybe it\u2019s not their strong suit, maybe you are catching them off guard, it gives them the level playing field to other people. One thing I\u2019m very also conscious of is when you\u2019re interviewing people is we all learn differently, we all act differently. And I don\u2019t want someone\u2019s necessarily social anxiety or their quirks or anything like that to necessarily stop from a good candidate getting through the process. So that\u2019s something that I always think about."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"And I wanted to ask you, from the flip side, what is your suggestion for Interviewees? Because I think a lot of times interviewees go in, and obviously they may be faced with an unskilled interviewer. What is your advice for really nailing an interview?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:12:01]: Yeah, I spent a lot of time thinking about this and in fact we did some work together where I shared some of this. So to me, it\u2019s a process. So the first thing you really need to be thinking about is what is the role and what does the company really need?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So you have to start by understanding that. And doing the research and reflection that\u2019s required. I think it\u2019s critical then to identify themes that you want to represent about yourself in the interview that are relevant and appropriate for what you\u2019ve learned about the needs of the company and their expectations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:12:31] So a theme might be, I\u2019m incredibly reliable or I\u2019m very technically competent in this one programming skill or this other technology or science. And with each theme, stockpile specific examples. And examples can be things like anecdotes or stories. They can be statistics, perhaps acknowledgments, maybe you won an award, or a boss said something positive to you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So with each theme, I\u2019m thinking in advance, what might be some things that I could say when the time is appropriate that represent those. So we\u2019re always trying to think about how can I show this information rather than just tell it? So I do that work in advance, and that\u2019s stockpiling that you can do. And then when you\u2019re in the moment, and somebody asks you a question, think about, as soon as you hear the question, say, that\u2019s a question where I\u2019d really like to demonstrate this theme."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Or these two themes. And then it becomes an activity of assembly rather than generating ideas in the moment. Think of it almost like a recipe. I\u2019m a lousy cook. But if I have a recipe and I have the ingredients ready, there\u2019s a chance that I might put together a pretty decent meal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. I think one specific recipe that works really well is a structure. And those who listen in on this know that I\u2019m a big fan of structure. It\u2019s a structure that involves three steps. A, D, D. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance. So when a question comes in, I answer the question, I give a concrete example, and then I explain why it\u2019s relevant to the job."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So what might be fun for the listeners, Andrew, is if you take on the role of interviewer, and I\u2019ll be an interviewee, and let\u2019s imagine that you are interviewing me to be a podcast host. What might be a reasonable question that you would ask, that\u2019s not just a yes, no answer, or some numeric answer, to see if I would make a good podcast host?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:14:15]: One of the questions I would ask is, sometimes schedules get shift around, and things pop up unexpectedly, so how would you prepare for an interview when you haven\u2019t had enough time?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ve had this happen a lot to me, so the ability to be spontaneous is critical and it\u2019s a skill that I have been working on and developing over my whole career. I have been called into many circumstances as a teacher, and as a coach, and as a parent even, where things have had to change in the moment, and I\u2019ve been able to adjust and adapt. There was a time where I showed up for my class, and the room had flooded that night, and nobody knew. I opened up the door and there\u2019s water all over the place and my students were outside. So we adjusted and adapt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We moved to a different space, I had people in different groups, and I changed the lesson. So I feel very comfortable in my ability to adjust and adapt. And if you were to hire me, I certainly would bring those skills to bear in the interviews I did, in the way in which we did the programming that we had."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:15:10] So in that answer, what I tried to do is say, yes, I\u2019m somebody who\u2019s flexible. And then gave some specific examples so you can see what that might look like. You could probably imagine the flooded room and me moving students around. And then at the end, I tried to connect the dots. We often assume that if I give you information, that you can connect those dots, but it\u2019s not always the case."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:15:29] My very first psychology professor started the very first class he had and said this, and it rings true to this day. The funny thing about common sense is it\u2019s not so common. And we think, oh, they\u2019ll just connect the dots. If I explain this one story, you really have to say what it means. So to me, it\u2019s answer the question, detailed example, describe the relevance. And if you can remember that, you will truly add value to what it is you\u2019re saying."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"I really do like your thematic approach to that, and especially creating that sort of connection with your answer is so crucial. And actually, in resumes, everyone used to put an objective. And I always tell people, I said, that\u2019s useless. Your objective is to get a job. But people have started adding summaries, and they\u2019ll just basically regurgitate a little bit what\u2019s on their resume. But what I tell people is your resume is sort of a canvas, and you\u2019re making them connect the dots for you. And people are not good at that."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:16:22] But with a summary, what you can do right at the top, is set the tone for how they\u2019re going to read that. So if you say, I\u2019m a project manager that brings experience from several different fields. You\u2019re starting to connect that dot for them. So they\u2019re not viewing you as a person who has bounced around from several industries. They\u2019re thinking, oh, this person has had a cohesive career. So I really like that approach."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:16:42]: I think that\u2019s relevant to all communication. The way we frame it and set it is the way people hear it. And that\u2019s important. There\u2019s one other strength of the ADD method or any structure is it helps package the information up so people can remember it. And in turn, share what you said with a better degree of accuracy. So for example, when I\u2019m interviewing with you, you probably in that moment aren\u2019t going to say you\u2019re hired. You probably have to go turn around, talk to others, represent me, versus the other people that others have interviewed, and then have a discussion. So if I package it up well, you can probably share that information in a better way."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We\u2019ve talked about what interviewers can do. We\u2019ve talked about what an interviewee can do. What do you think about the follow up? So if I am interviewing for a job, what should I do to follow up? What\u2019s appropriate? You know, do I wait a day? Do I wait a week? People are afraid of being ghosted. What\u2019s your recommendation for follow up?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:17:34]: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question because it\u2019s probably the most terrifying part of the interview. Actually, it\u2019s, it\u2019s waiting to hear how things went. What I tell job seekers is, sometimes you will not hear anything because companies are very protective. They don\u2019t want to open themselves to lawsuits, so they don\u2019t want to give any sort of feedback. So what I often tell people is that the follow up actually starts in the interview itself. Because you want to leave a door open, so that way you can come back in. So really try and build a strong connection during the interview, so that way you\u2019re not leaving the possibility that the door is closed and you\u2019re not going to get back in."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:18:11] So, you know, if you are interviewing with someone, make sure you connect with them on LinkedIn. Make sure that you ask them for general advice. Just because it\u2019s an interview for a job doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t say, you know, I saw on your wall that, you know, you went to school in Philadelphia. Do you have any suggestions for a restaurant there? And maybe they say, oh, it was a long time ago. And you can say, well, there\u2019s got to be a good spot somewhere. And then they might say, you know, X, Y, or Z. Or maybe there\u2019s a book on their shelf. And you said, I\u2019ve been meaning to read that, do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? And that way you\u2019re forming more of a connection."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:18:47] I think thank you notes are a great tool because you can say, oh, thank you so much for telling me about that book. I found it, and I read it, and I thought it was so fantastic. So it\u2019s almost just keeping that conversation going. You don\u2019t want to be annoying about it, but you want to keep that conversation flowing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:19:05]: I am very old school with this as well. I do think a follow up thank you is appropriate. I really like your idea of starting that process in the actual interview itself. If nothing else, you know, some hiring managers, I remember when I was a hiring manager, we were growing very rapidly. I was interviewing lots and lots of people. Something like that would remind me of who the person was. So I think it\u2019s very important. And it also, in the thank you note, beyond reminding people about who you are, it allows you to reinforce certain points or perhaps, change things up a little bit. You might say, and ever since our conversation, I\u2019ve really been thinking about this, and here\u2019s where I\u2019ve landed. So you can really add some emphasis."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"Excellent."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:19:43]: I want to step back, and we\u2019ve talked about interviewing, we\u2019ve talked about presence, but I want to take a broader view, which is really about careers. What advice do you have on how to leverage online communities and tools to help us with our career growth, where we see our trajectory?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:19:58]: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. And I think, what I suggest people do, is they think of their careers as sort of concentric circles. And you have the people that you\u2019re closest to at work, you have then the larger workforce that you\u2019re part of, and then you have your profession. And I always think it\u2019s important to have people within all of those spheres, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who can help you grow."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:20:25] So the immediate group of people, they\u2019re going to be able to tell you what\u2019s happening on the ground. The larger circle will help you, um, learn a little bit about what\u2019s happening throughout the company. And then that wider circle is going to tell you what\u2019s happening in the industry as a whole. And I think having those connections with people really help you navigate all of those different areas. So if you\u2019re having trouble maybe with your manager, maybe one of your close co-workers can help you, or maybe someone else in that. But the idea is almost like you want a spiderweb that goes from the center. And that way if things maybe fall apart at your company, if there are layoffs, you want that web to be able to support you. So look for professional organizations. There are a lot of groups online, there\u2019s LinkedIn groups, there\u2019s Slack channels. So that\u2019s why I always say networking is the rocket fuel for a career, even if you don\u2019t want to call it networking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:21:14]: Right. I think encouraging people, and some people aren\u2019t comfortable doing that networking, but really thinking about, that\u2019s part of your job. And it\u2019s beneficial to the companies as well for its employees to have strong networks, because it can help funnel in new employees. If there has to be a reduction in force, those folks can get taken care of perhaps through those networks. So I think that\u2019s important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:21:33] One thing I\u2019ll add to this is. If you\u2019re looking to change careers or to see the next step in your career, using tools like LinkedIn and others, you can find people who have gotten to the place you want or the company you want. You can look at how did they get there. What kind of things did they do. What kind of groups are they part of. And you can begin to model your trajectory after some of these people, and certainly you could get connections that you might not have had so you can have those conversations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Speaking of conversations, this has been a lot of fun. I\u2019ve never done this sort of back and forth thing, and I enjoyed it, so thank you. Before we end, I\u2019d like to end the way I do, at least on my podcast. I have three questions I\u2019d like to ask. One I\u2019m making special just for you, Andrew, and the other two I ask everybody."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So we\u2019ve talked about interviewing. I\u2019m curious, what is one response you use to the interview question of, do you have any questions for me? It\u2019s often the last question that gets asked. How do you answer that?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:22:26]: I think it really depends on the situation. If I\u2019m feeling a little bit confident in a job situation, or a career situation, I will usually try and go for the throat and say, based on what I told you, what is the thing that will keep me from either getting this job, or what is the thing that maybe will trip me up for a promotion?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:22:47] And I\u2019m just trying to let the person know, first of all, I understand that I have a weakness, because we all do, and that I also know that there\u2019s a possibility that I\u2019m not going to get this. And I think, again, you have to read the room, because not everyone\u2019s going to appreciate that question, but it can be a very direct question that people, I think, respect."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:23:10]: Absolutely. I like that. And I think it\u2019s a good question to ask if things are right, if the situation is right. The question I always like to ask is, if you were in my position, what\u2019s the one thing you wish you would have asked? And I have found this to be a very enlightening question. So when somebody says, do you have any questions for me? I say, yes. When you were in this position, what do you wish you would have asked before you got hired at this company? And I\u2019ve gotten amazingly insightful questions. Like, oh, our benefits program stinks. Or I really wish I would have known about these two people and how it\u2019s challenging. So it\u2019s really interesting."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So I think the bottom line is, be strategic in how you answer that question, and you should have an answer to that question. Question number two, Andrew, who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"[00:23:51]: I again, come from a very nerdy journalism background. So I\u2019m always going to go back to Walter Cronkite. He was a very flawed person, but at the same time, I very much respected the work he put into who he was. And he had so much weight to him. And a lot of that was cultivated by CBS, which is the company he worked for. But I very much respected the fact that he took his job in journalism so seriously and that he understood the weight of who he was."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. And he was well respected for having a steady hand and a steady voice during some unsteady times. Question number three, final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"Being genuine, being truthful, and also humor. I think there are some professors here that have written a book on the importance of humor in business."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:24:48]: Absolutely. Authenticity is important. Being truthful is really important. You\u2019re referring to the work of Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas, who\u2019ve been guests on the show. Their book, Humor, Seriously, is all about how to leverage humor in a work environment, so it\u2019s appropriate."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"At the end of the day, Andrew, first, thank you for this. And second, I heard several themes throughout what you talked about. It\u2019s about being authentic, it\u2019s about being present and connected. And it\u2019s about making sure that you\u2019re responding to what\u2019s needed in the moment. And it is your obligation in your career and in your interviews to take an active role and to be very strategic in it. And I think that advice is really helpful. And thank you for this experiment that we did today."},{"author":"Andrew Seaman","text":"Yeah. Thank you so much for having me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:25:31]: Thank you for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast.

We hope to share some immediately useful practical and tactical advice to help our combined listeners in their careers. We\u2019ve identified a number of topics and we\u2019ll be discussing them with each other and with you. So let\u2019s get started, Andrew. I\u2019d like to talk a bit about online presence. How important is our online presence and how can we maximize our LinkedIn profile and presence through posting on LinkedIn?"]},{"begin":"91.400","end":"112.200","lines":["Online presence is your first interview. So what I always tell people is post what you\u2019re reading about your profession, post what you\u2019re passionate about, and add to that conversation because it\u2019s a way for people to get to know you before they actually meet you. And it\u2019s a way for them to keep up with you too. So I think it\u2019s hugely important and I encourage it."]},{"begin":"112.200","end":"127.880","lines":["[00:01:52]: I think that\u2019s really important to think about curating your profile and social presence based on the fact that people might be looking at that way before they meet you.

The types of things? Do we reveal information about our hobbies and interests beyond work?

One thing that I always tell people, and they\u2019re surprised when I tell them this, is that I like to quilt and sew. And I know that sounds really strange, but it\u2019s very meditative for me. But I don\u2019t want to be known as a quilter. I don\u2019t want to make it a hobby where I\u2019m posting on Instagram or things like that. So I don\u2019t really talk about it. I don\u2019t post about it that much, you know, it\u2019s just because that\u2019s for me. So I recommend people posting regularly, but almost as a challenge to yourself."]},{"begin":"166.000","end":"186.840","lines":["So think about it like at least three times a week. And look at what other people in your industry are talking about or maybe areas that you\u2019re passionate about. So, you know, we\u2019re here at Stanford. And everyone\u2019s on a bicycle. So if you care about sort of creating bikeable cities or something like that, that might not be your profession, but if you\u2019re passionate about it, you could post about that too."]},{"begin":"186.840","end":"205.280","lines":["And that way when people see you and see your profile, they know, okay, this person is a rounded individual. That they have their instructional knowledge where they\u2019re a professor or, you know, maybe they\u2019re an engineer or something, but then they also have this other thing that they\u2019re passionate about and they get to see you for who you are completely."]},{"begin":"205.280","end":"221.400","lines":["So you know, a few times a week, make it a mix of what you care about, whether it\u2019s profession or not. And then also, you know, a lot of times now when I look at someone\u2019s profile, I skip their experience section and I just look at their activity.

So I think you have to make a decision about how much you want to reveal about yourself."]},{"begin":"239.440","end":"251.240","lines":["One last question on this online presence, what\u2019s your take on commenting on other people\u2019s posts versus just posting yourself? Is there a difference when you as a hiring manager, from your position, make recommendations around that?"]},{"begin":"251.240","end":"273.440","lines":["[00:04:11]: What I tell people is, are you adding value to the conversation? I think it was my math teacher, and I don\u2019t know why he had this sign in his room, like, seventh grade, like, algebra teacher, and he had a sign that had Charlie Brown on it, and it said, are you listening or are you waiting to talk? I was usually always waiting to talk, but one thing that I just always thought is like, am I actually moving this conversation forward?"]},{"begin":"273.440","end":"292.880","lines":["So when I read comments and it\u2019s like, yes, plus one, that doesn\u2019t really do anything for me, but if someone says, you know what, I agree with this but, and they can add something really substantial or a good caveat, I think that\u2019s really where the value comes in. So when you\u2019re going to comment something, just think, is this actually adding to the conversation?"]},{"begin":"292.880","end":"306.920","lines":["I do recommend commenting because some people, they find it scary to post and usually it\u2019s almost like putting a comment is a little bit of a lighter lift and a little bit less scary. So if you don\u2019t want to post right now, try commenting, but make sure you\u2019re actually moving the conversation forward."]},{"begin":"306.920","end":"312.880","lines":["[00:05:07]: I think that\u2019s great advice in all communication, is to just move things forward, which I think we should do now."]},{"begin":"312.880","end":"329.280","lines":["So, I wanted to ask you about interview presence because I know a lot of people, they go into an interview, and they show up and they\u2019re the deer in headlights. What do you think is important and best practice for interview presence, whether it be in person or virtual?"]},{"begin":"329.280","end":"352.280","lines":["[00:05:29]: Yeah, so presence in terms of how you show up for an interview matters a lot. People are forming opinions of you even before you log into the Zoom or walk into the room. And so you really have to think about what is it I want to display. So what\u2019s the timeliness of my responses? What information am I sharing? Am I doing it properly? I once as a hiring manager, I shared this story with you."]},{"begin":"352.280","end":"370.160","lines":["Somebody sent me their cover letter and they said they were detail oriented and they spelled detail wrong, right? I\u2019m forming impressions about them before they ever walk in the door. So your presence matters and it\u2019s everything that happens from the moment you connect and contact the company all the way through the whole interaction."]},{"begin":"370.160","end":"388.480","lines":["[00:06:10] I\u2019ll give you another example. When I was a hiring manager. I sat in a place where I actually could look out a window and there was somebody who was coming to interview with me, and he was clearly running late. He came into the parking lot, cut somebody off to get a space, runs in, was very rude to the receptionist, and then comes and does an amazing interview with me."]},{"begin":"388.480","end":"409.240","lines":["Well, who was that person? Was it the person who interviewed with me perfectly, or was it the person who treated people rudely? The person did not end up getting the job.

So we have to think about who we want to project ourselves as and we have to be consistent throughout all of our interactions with the company."]},{"begin":"409.240","end":"419.320","lines":["Now I\u2019m certainly not saying be disingenuous and not be who you truly are.

Here\u2019s what I would\u2019ve liked to think about or have said. I also think it\u2019s important after you have an interview, \u2018cause not every question do you hit and nail the answer the way you want. I think in a, in a follow-up, thank you email, you can do some damage control or correcting, as needed. But we need to be thinking about our presence. I mean, the question you asked is predicated on being aware enough to know that things didn\u2019t hit. And a lot of people are just so glad that the interview\u2019s over that they don\u2019t really think about what they might want to correct, and then think about the best way to do it."]},{"begin":"468.400","end":"486.520","lines":["[00:07:48] I\u2019d love to ask you, Andrew, about interviewing from the interviewer\u2019s perspective.

You do it very well on your podcast. What are some advice you give to those who are the interviewer?"]},{"begin":"486.520","end":"518.960","lines":["[00:08:06]: Hiring managers are rarely taught how to interview people. So it\u2019s one of those things where I don\u2019t give them a pass, because if you are a hiring manager, I think you need to have some skill in talking to people to vet them and see if they\u2019re a good fit. But I understand that a lot of companies don\u2019t even really train people. They might say, oh, here\u2019s a video to watch beforehand. But for interviewers, I think the main thing is that there\u2019s really no excuse to go into a meeting unprepared because it is a very life altering decision for the person who you\u2019re having a conversation with."]},{"begin":"518.960","end":"562.240","lines":["So go in there at least with, I think, three things that you want to assess that person on. And the first is obviously just getting to know them. You know, how do they interact with the environment? How do they interact with you? What has been their experience? Why do you want this job? Why do you want to work at this employer? So go in there with a game plan and try to figure out if this person can do the job, can they do it well. And then the other thing is, to make sure it is a conversation. Because I think a lot of hiring managers, they try and explain what the job is. It may be something from the job description that they\u2019ve already read. So make sure there\u2019s a back and forth, otherwise you\u2019re just wasting everyone\u2019s time."]},{"begin":"562.240","end":"592.920","lines":["[00:09:22]: Yeah, that\u2019s critical to do some pre thinking about what is it you want to assess. I think there\u2019s some other things to be thinking about as an interviewer. One is, if this is the ideal candidate, the interview can serve as the beginning of your onboarding, right? You have the opportunity to set expectations and goals and norms. You can also be sensing where this person will fit, and who and how they will best learn to ramp them up to be most effective most quickly. So really seeing it as something that can serve a purpose beyond assessing is this a qualified candidate, I think makes a lot of sense."]},{"begin":"592.920","end":"625.720","lines":["And, you know, listening I think is the critical part as an interviewer. Listening to what is said, listening to what is not said. I always try, when I\u2019m interviewing, to be thinking about what\u2019s a good follow up question to give me more insight and to demonstrate that I really heard what the person was saying. Sometimes what I would do as an interviewer, and I\u2019d love to get your opinion on this, I often will challenge an interviewee to help me connect their answer to how they think that will play out in the job. Because a lot of people just give me information and I\u2019m looking, how does that information relate to the job. And it gives me a good assessment of if they\u2019ve done their homework."]},{"begin":"625.720","end":"634.120","lines":["What do you think is appropriate as an interviewer to, to be a little challenging, to push on some of those answers? Is that appropriate? Not appropriate? What do you think?"]},{"begin":"634.120","end":"668.080","lines":["[00:10:34]: I think it\u2019s appropriate to push as much as you need to assess their abilities. And what I\u2019m looking for when I talk to people is, how they\u2019re drawing from what they have done to apply to what they are doing now. I don\u2019t expect them to have all the answers, but I expect them to say, oh, I did X and that can get me to Y. But from an interviewer\u2019s perspective, yeah, I think you should be able to push. And also, I think you can warm the water a little bit by giving them an example. By saying, in the past I worked at this company, and when I came here, I did this."]},{"begin":"668.080","end":"705.080","lines":["So it\u2019s almost like you are showing them the blueprint for answering the question, and it makes it a little bit more fair. So that way, in case that person, maybe it\u2019s not their strong suit, maybe you are catching them off guard, it gives them the level playing field to other people. One thing I\u2019m very also conscious of is when you\u2019re interviewing people is we all learn differently, we all act differently. And I don\u2019t want someone\u2019s necessarily social anxiety or their quirks or anything like that to necessarily stop from a good candidate getting through the process. So that\u2019s something that I always think about."]},{"begin":"705.080","end":"720.400","lines":["And I wanted to ask you, from the flip side, what is your suggestion for Interviewees? Because I think a lot of times interviewees go in, and obviously they may be faced with an unskilled interviewer. What is your advice for really nailing an interview?"]},{"begin":"720.400","end":"734.680","lines":["[00:12:01]: Yeah, I spent a lot of time thinking about this and in fact we did some work together where I shared some of this. So to me, it\u2019s a process. So the first thing you really need to be thinking about is what is the role and what does the company really need?"]},{"begin":"734.680","end":"750.920","lines":["So you have to start by understanding that. And doing the research and reflection that\u2019s required. I think it\u2019s critical then to identify themes that you want to represent about yourself in the interview that are relevant and appropriate for what you\u2019ve learned about the needs of the company and their expectations."]},{"begin":"750.920","end":"773.320","lines":["[00:12:31] So a theme might be, I\u2019m incredibly reliable or I\u2019m very technically competent in this one programming skill or this other technology or science. And with each theme, stockpile specific examples. And examples can be things like anecdotes or stories. They can be statistics, perhaps acknowledgments, maybe you won an award, or a boss said something positive to you."]},{"begin":"773.320","end":"800.280","lines":["So with each theme, I\u2019m thinking in advance, what might be some things that I could say when the time is appropriate that represent those. So we\u2019re always trying to think about how can I show this information rather than just tell it? So I do that work in advance, and that\u2019s stockpiling that you can do. And then when you\u2019re in the moment, and somebody asks you a question, think about, as soon as you hear the question, say, that\u2019s a question where I\u2019d really like to demonstrate this theme."]},{"begin":"800.280","end":"838.120","lines":["Or these two themes. And then it becomes an activity of assembly rather than generating ideas in the moment. Think of it almost like a recipe. I\u2019m a lousy cook. But if I have a recipe and I have the ingredients ready, there\u2019s a chance that I might put together a pretty decent meal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. I think one specific recipe that works really well is a structure. And those who listen in on this know that I\u2019m a big fan of structure. It\u2019s a structure that involves three steps. A, D, D. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance. So when a question comes in, I answer the question, I give a concrete example, and then I explain why it\u2019s relevant to the job."]},{"begin":"838.120","end":"855.560","lines":["So what might be fun for the listeners, Andrew, is if you take on the role of interviewer, and I\u2019ll be an interviewee, and let\u2019s imagine that you are interviewing me to be a podcast host. What might be a reasonable question that you would ask, that\u2019s not just a yes, no answer, or some numeric answer, to see if I would make a good podcast host?"]},{"begin":"855.560","end":"866.120","lines":["[00:14:15]: One of the questions I would ask is, sometimes schedules get shift around, and things pop up unexpectedly, so how would you prepare for an interview when you haven\u2019t had enough time?"]},{"begin":"866.120","end":"894.640","lines":["I\u2019ve had this happen a lot to me, so the ability to be spontaneous is critical and it\u2019s a skill that I have been working on and developing over my whole career. I have been called into many circumstances as a teacher, and as a coach, and as a parent even, where things have had to change in the moment, and I\u2019ve been able to adjust and adapt. There was a time where I showed up for my class, and the room had flooded that night, and nobody knew. I opened up the door and there\u2019s water all over the place and my students were outside. So we adjusted and adapt."]},{"begin":"894.640","end":"909.560","lines":["We moved to a different space, I had people in different groups, and I changed the lesson. So I feel very comfortable in my ability to adjust and adapt. And if you were to hire me, I certainly would bring those skills to bear in the interviews I did, in the way in which we did the programming that we had."]},{"begin":"909.560","end":"929.320","lines":["[00:15:10] So in that answer, what I tried to do is say, yes, I\u2019m somebody who\u2019s flexible. And then gave some specific examples so you can see what that might look like. You could probably imagine the flooded room and me moving students around. And then at the end, I tried to connect the dots. We often assume that if I give you information, that you can connect those dots, but it\u2019s not always the case."]},{"begin":"929.320","end":"953.520","lines":["[00:15:29] My very first psychology professor started the very first class he had and said this, and it rings true to this day. The funny thing about common sense is it\u2019s not so common. And we think, oh, they\u2019ll just connect the dots. If I explain this one story, you really have to say what it means. So to me, it\u2019s answer the question, detailed example, describe the relevance. And if you can remember that, you will truly add value to what it is you\u2019re saying."]},{"begin":"953.520","end":"981.520","lines":["I really do like your thematic approach to that, and especially creating that sort of connection with your answer is so crucial. And actually, in resumes, everyone used to put an objective. And I always tell people, I said, that\u2019s useless. Your objective is to get a job. But people have started adding summaries, and they\u2019ll just basically regurgitate a little bit what\u2019s on their resume. But what I tell people is your resume is sort of a canvas, and you\u2019re making them connect the dots for you. And people are not good at that."]},{"begin":"981.520","end":"1002.600","lines":["[00:16:22] But with a summary, what you can do right at the top, is set the tone for how they\u2019re going to read that. So if you say, I\u2019m a project manager that brings experience from several different fields. You\u2019re starting to connect that dot for them. So they\u2019re not viewing you as a person who has bounced around from several industries. They\u2019re thinking, oh, this person has had a cohesive career. So I really like that approach."]},{"begin":"1002.600","end":"1037.400","lines":["[00:16:42]: I think that\u2019s relevant to all communication. The way we frame it and set it is the way people hear it. And that\u2019s important. There\u2019s one other strength of the ADD method or any structure is it helps package the information up so people can remember it. And in turn, share what you said with a better degree of accuracy. So for example, when I\u2019m interviewing with you, you probably in that moment aren\u2019t going to say you\u2019re hired. You probably have to go turn around, talk to others, represent me, versus the other people that others have interviewed, and then have a discussion. So if I package it up well, you can probably share that information in a better way."]},{"begin":"1037.400","end":"1052.840","lines":["We\u2019ve talked about what interviewers can do. We\u2019ve talked about what an interviewee can do. What do you think about the follow up? So if I am interviewing for a job, what should I do to follow up? What\u2019s appropriate? You know, do I wait a day? Do I wait a week? People are afraid of being ghosted. What\u2019s your recommendation for follow up?"]},{"begin":"1052.840","end":"1090.560","lines":["[00:17:34]: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question because it\u2019s probably the most terrifying part of the interview. Actually, it\u2019s, it\u2019s waiting to hear how things went. What I tell job seekers is, sometimes you will not hear anything because companies are very protective. They don\u2019t want to open themselves to lawsuits, so they don\u2019t want to give any sort of feedback. So what I often tell people is that the follow up actually starts in the interview itself. Because you want to leave a door open, so that way you can come back in. So really try and build a strong connection during the interview, so that way you\u2019re not leaving the possibility that the door is closed and you\u2019re not going to get back in."]},{"begin":"1090.560","end":"1125.480","lines":["[00:18:11] So, you know, if you are interviewing with someone, make sure you connect with them on LinkedIn. Make sure that you ask them for general advice. Just because it\u2019s an interview for a job doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t say, you know, I saw on your wall that, you know, you went to school in Philadelphia. Do you have any suggestions for a restaurant there? And maybe they say, oh, it was a long time ago. And you can say, well, there\u2019s got to be a good spot somewhere. And then they might say, you know, X, Y, or Z. Or maybe there\u2019s a book on their shelf. And you said, I\u2019ve been meaning to read that, do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? And that way you\u2019re forming more of a connection."]},{"begin":"1125.480","end":"1145.040","lines":["[00:18:47] I think thank you notes are a great tool because you can say, oh, thank you so much for telling me about that book. I found it, and I read it, and I thought it was so fantastic. So it\u2019s almost just keeping that conversation going. You don\u2019t want to be annoying about it, but you want to keep that conversation flowing."]},{"begin":"1145.040","end":"1182.160","lines":["[00:19:05]: I am very old school with this as well. I do think a follow up thank you is appropriate. I really like your idea of starting that process in the actual interview itself. If nothing else, you know, some hiring managers, I remember when I was a hiring manager, we were growing very rapidly. I was interviewing lots and lots of people. Something like that would remind me of who the person was. So I think it\u2019s very important. And it also, in the thank you note, beyond reminding people about who you are, it allows you to reinforce certain points or perhaps, change things up a little bit. You might say, and ever since our conversation, I\u2019ve really been thinking about this, and here\u2019s where I\u2019ve landed. So you can really add some emphasis."]},{"begin":"1182.160","end":"1182.760","lines":["Excellent."]},{"begin":"1182.760","end":"1198.120","lines":["[00:19:43]: I want to step back, and we\u2019ve talked about interviewing, we\u2019ve talked about presence, but I want to take a broader view, which is really about careers. What advice do you have on how to leverage online communities and tools to help us with our career growth, where we see our trajectory?"]},{"begin":"1198.120","end":"1223.680","lines":["[00:19:58]: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. And I think, what I suggest people do, is they think of their careers as sort of concentric circles. And you have the people that you\u2019re closest to at work, you have then the larger workforce that you\u2019re part of, and then you have your profession. And I always think it\u2019s important to have people within all of those spheres, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who can help you grow."]},{"begin":"1223.680","end":"1273.960","lines":["[00:20:25] So the immediate group of people, they\u2019re going to be able to tell you what\u2019s happening on the ground. The larger circle will help you, um, learn a little bit about what\u2019s happening throughout the company. And then that wider circle is going to tell you what\u2019s happening in the industry as a whole. And I think having those connections with people really help you navigate all of those different areas. So if you\u2019re having trouble maybe with your manager, maybe one of your close co-workers can help you, or maybe someone else in that. But the idea is almost like you want a spiderweb that goes from the center. And that way if things maybe fall apart at your company, if there are layoffs, you want that web to be able to support you. So look for professional organizations. There are a lot of groups online, there\u2019s LinkedIn groups, there\u2019s Slack channels. So that\u2019s why I always say networking is the rocket fuel for a career, even if you don\u2019t want to call it networking."]},{"begin":"1273.960","end":"1293.280","lines":["[00:21:14]: Right. I think encouraging people, and some people aren\u2019t comfortable doing that networking, but really thinking about, that\u2019s part of your job. And it\u2019s beneficial to the companies as well for its employees to have strong networks, because it can help funnel in new employees. If there has to be a reduction in force, those folks can get taken care of perhaps through those networks. So I think that\u2019s important."]},{"begin":"1293.280","end":"1319.000","lines":["[00:21:33] One thing I\u2019ll add to this is. If you\u2019re looking to change careers or to see the next step in your career, using tools like LinkedIn and others, you can find people who have gotten to the place you want or the company you want. You can look at how did they get there. What kind of things did they do. What kind of groups are they part of. And you can begin to model your trajectory after some of these people, and certainly you could get connections that you might not have had so you can have those conversations."]},{"begin":"1319.000","end":"1334.200","lines":["Speaking of conversations, this has been a lot of fun. I\u2019ve never done this sort of back and forth thing, and I enjoyed it, so thank you. Before we end, I\u2019d like to end the way I do, at least on my podcast. I have three questions I\u2019d like to ask. One I\u2019m making special just for you, Andrew, and the other two I ask everybody."]},{"begin":"1334.200","end":"1346.480","lines":["So we\u2019ve talked about interviewing. I\u2019m curious, what is one response you use to the interview question of, do you have any questions for me? It\u2019s often the last question that gets asked. How do you answer that?"]},{"begin":"1346.480","end":"1367.080","lines":["[00:22:26]: I think it really depends on the situation. If I\u2019m feeling a little bit confident in a job situation, or a career situation, I will usually try and go for the throat and say, based on what I told you, what is the thing that will keep me from either getting this job, or what is the thing that maybe will trip me up for a promotion?"]},{"begin":"1367.080","end":"1389.640","lines":["[00:22:47] And I\u2019m just trying to let the person know, first of all, I understand that I have a weakness, because we all do, and that I also know that there\u2019s a possibility that I\u2019m not going to get this. And I think, again, you have to read the room, because not everyone\u2019s going to appreciate that question, but it can be a very direct question that people, I think, respect."]},{"begin":"1389.640","end":"1420.320","lines":["[00:23:10]: Absolutely. I like that. And I think it\u2019s a good question to ask if things are right, if the situation is right. The question I always like to ask is, if you were in my position, what\u2019s the one thing you wish you would have asked? And I have found this to be a very enlightening question. So when somebody says, do you have any questions for me? I say, yes. When you were in this position, what do you wish you would have asked before you got hired at this company? And I\u2019ve gotten amazingly insightful questions. Like, oh, our benefits program stinks. Or I really wish I would have known about these two people and how it\u2019s challenging. So it\u2019s really interesting."]},{"begin":"1420.320","end":"1431.120","lines":["So I think the bottom line is, be strategic in how you answer that question, and you should have an answer to that question.
