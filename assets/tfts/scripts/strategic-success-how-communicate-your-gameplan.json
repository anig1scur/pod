Many of us focus on our day-to-day work on just the tasks we need to complete and executing them well. Taking time to reflect on strategy in our organizations and our own life can help us be successful. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am very excited to speak with Jesper S\u00f8rensen. Jesper is a professor of organizational behavior at the GSB along with being the senior associate dean of academic affairs. Jesper specializes in dynamics of organizational and strategic change. He teaches strategic leadership, crafting and leading strategy. And along with fellow professor Glenn Carroll, Jesper wrote Making Great Strategy: Arguing for Organization Advantage."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Jesper. Thanks for being here. I\u2019m super excited for our conversation."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Thanks for having me, Matt. It\u2019s really an honor to be on your podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, thank you. Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. You\u2019ve been studying and teaching strategy for over 25 years. Can you share with us how you define strategy? And explain how it\u2019s different from planning."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Sure. The tagline here at the GSB: Change lives. Change organizations Change the world. What I always like to tell students is if you want to change the world, you have to build great organizations, because large scale change always happens through organizations. And if you\u2019re going to build a great organization, you have to have the resources to sustain that organization."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And strategy is really about explaining how you secure that organization\u2019s economic prosperity. And if you\u2019re a public company, that means how do you maximize profits, perhaps. But even if you\u2019re a nonprofit, you have to have a strategy that is somehow to logic by which you get enough resources to be able to survive and do what it is you want to do."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Now that\u2019s different from planning. I think planning is really about the order of operations. Because the sequence of things that you\u2019re going to do, once you know why it is that you have a reason to do something and what the outcome is going to be. And so, I think strategy is, that sense, much more complicated, because in order to get the resources that you need, you have to engage with other actors. So, you have to engage with your customers and suppliers and so on and so forth, and you don\u2019t have control over them. Planning is about the things that you can control, but strategy is really much more complicated in that sense."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So, it sounds like planning is much more tactical. Once you have the strategy, you then invoke the plans to enact that strategy."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You shared that one of the prime directives for leaders is to focus on building a strategy. What are some of the mistakes or misconceptions you found over the years that leaders have about strategy or its role in their organization?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, I think the biggest misconception that a lot of managers in organizations have and leaders is that strategy is not their job. So, I think in a lot of organizations we have this image of strategy being dictated at the top, that the CEO is going to articulate here\u2019s what the strategy is. It\u2019s like a football coach sending the play in from the sideline and then we\u2019re all just going to go and execute."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, you\u2019ll meet tons of managers who will say, \u201cI don\u2019t do strategy. I\u2019m just about execution.\u201d But of course, strategy is really about how you\u2019re going to best allocate your time and your resources. That\u2019s ultimately what it\u2019s about. And so, if you have any responsibility in the organization, you\u2019re doing strategy. And so, you need to be able to engage with the strategy."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And I think one of the things that happens is that we disempower ourselves if we think about strategy as that. The related misconception is then that people think of strategy as like a set it once a year or once every five years kind of thing, and then we\u2019re just going to go execute on that plan. But if you think that strategy is set \u2014 No battle plan survives contact with the enemy. Right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, as soon as you start to do things, things start to change. And so, it\u2019s not just about drafting this beautiful architectural blueprint and then handing it off for somebody to go build it, because you got to adapt to a changing landscape."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So, I\u2019m hearing you say that strategy is something that everybody owns within an organization \u2014 it\u2019s not just comes down from on high \u2014 and that it has to adapt and change. I have been part of several organizations where when people say \u201cWe\u2019re going to strategically plan,\u201d everybody\u2019s eyes roll and they think, oh, we\u2019re just going to put another document on the shelf or it\u2019s just going to sit on some website somewhere. And what I\u2019m hearing you say is that it\u2019s living and you have to evolve it and everybody\u2019s involved in it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Which leads me to the next question, which is in your book and teaching, you and Glenn Carroll make a very convincing claim that organizations should craft strategy arguments. Can you share what you mean by a strategy argument? What are they and how can they help?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"What Glenn and I are trying to do in that book is basically help people think about strategy not as just a set of analytical frameworks, which is what we teach many times in business schools."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"If you think about the classic way of teaching strategy in a business school, it\u2019s Porter five forces or differentiation versus low cost. And those are all really important. But when you\u2019re doing strategy on a day-to-day basis, you have to understand like how is this working. So, it\u2019s an explanation, and that\u2019s how I do think it\u2019s related to communication. It\u2019s an explanation for how you think you\u2019re going to succeed. And that\u2019s an argument, and an argument is simply a set of assumptions that lead to a conclusion. Right? That force a conclusion."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, what a strategy argument is, it\u2019s a statement about what are the investments and the activities that we are going to undertake that\u2019s going to lead us to be able to create and capture economic value. And if we can do those things, if we can understand the connection between those investments and those activities and how we create economic value and how we capture economic value, then we can start to have sophisticated conversations about what is it that\u2019s working, what is it that\u2019s not working. And it gives us a model through which we can see the world."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The thing I feel is so powerful about this notion of strategy as an argument is, one, it involves how you think about it. Because when we craft arguments, we think about things like who are we speaking to, what\u2019s the context. And it implies that this is a conversation that has to be had. Again, it\u2019s not some dictation that comes down from somebody. So, I find that really powerful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And it also implies in an argument that there is debate and discussion and change and evolution, and I think that\u2019s really, really important. And it fits very nicely with what \u2014 As you know, I teach strategic communication. And while I talk a lot about the importance of communicating strategically, I\u2019m really curious to have you share your thoughts on how communication is important in strategy."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, I think there\u2019s two different parts to that. And one, just to key off of what you just said, I do think \u2014 And in the book, Glenn and I, we devote an entire chapter top basically thinking about how can you argue constructively as a group in an organization."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Oftentimes what we say when we teach, if we teach MBA students or executives, we say, \u201cYou should go and you should argue more in your organizations.\u201d And then a lot of people are then like, \u201cWhoa, no way. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Because what they\u2019re hearing is fight."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And we\u2019re not saying you should go fight more. Because a fight is kind of like you\u2019re throwing assertions at each other and you\u2019re just waiting for somebody to give in, so it\u2019s like a street fight. But there are ways to structure debates and arguments so that they are constructive. And part of that is about having the ability to listen to somebody else and hear what it is that they\u2019re trying to say and hear what their logic is."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"I think most people believe things for a reason, like they have a reason for believing it. You might disagree both with their conclusion and with some of their reasons, but you can\u2019t engage constructively in a debate unless you hear them on that dimension. And so, really it\u2019s about how do you structure engagements with each other to create that space."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"I think the other part of communicating strategically that\u2019s really important is when we think about delegation. So, what we know is that if you want to build a great organization, you\u2019re not going to be able to do that yourself. You can\u2019t make all the decisions, much as you might want to. And so, we all know that we have to be able to delegate and we have to be able to empower people."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And we have lots of books that tell us delegation is wonderful, and even the word empowerment sounds so wonderful. But of course, the truth is most leaders wake up at 3:00 in the morning petrified because they\u2019ve delegated a task to somebody else. And what they petrified, what are they scared about? They\u2019re scared that their subordinate is going to make the wrong decision. And at 3:00 in the morning, what is the wrong decision? It\u2019s not the decision I would have made."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, there\u2019s this tension. Like on the one hand, you don\u2019t want to make all the decisions. And yet, you want to make all the decisions. Or at least you want somebody who might be closer to the information to make a better decision because they have more information, but you want them to think about it the way you think about it."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And then the question is how do you get people to think about things the way you think about things. That\u2019s through communication. So, that\u2019s about really explaining why you think we win, why you think we are a successful organization, why you think these sets of actions are the things that we need to do in order to accomplish our goals. And so, that\u2019s where I do think really clear communication is going to be essential to effective strategic leadership."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The fact that you are invoking the power of listening and being willing to engage in conflict, but productive conflict, so we can get to a collaborative place with our strategy is a very different way of thinking about strategy in general. And I think that\u2019s really powerful for all of us to think about. And clearly, being able to articulate your strategy, packaging it and communicating it in a way that not only motivates people, but also helps makes better decisions is absolutely critical, for sure."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Right. I mean, there\u2019s this element of strategy that we have a \u2014 I think most of our stereotype of what strategy is, is very top down."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, then you would think communication is just broadcasting. But of course, we also know that lots of great strategies are discovered, and they\u2019re discovered because the leaders were able to listen to their frontline workers or their frontline managers tell them here\u2019s something that\u2019s even better than what we\u2019re doing now."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, of course, strategy is really both. It\u2019s both top down and bottom up. And so, you have to be able to both be able to articulate what it is that you want to say and where you think we should be going, but then also be able to listen and hear where you might be wrong. Because I think the other part that we really emphasize is in an argument, well, how do you make an argument? You make assumptions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And assumptions are testable. They\u2019re going to be proven wrong or they\u2019re going to be proven right. And you have to be open to the possibility that the assumption you made yesterday has turned out to be wrong today, and that you therefore need to revise your theory. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to go back and give up, but it means that you have to update your understanding of the world."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We\u2019ve talked a lot about testing assumptions and how to really challenge yourself to be open to what the reality is instead of staying fixed on what you thought it was, and thank you for reemphasizing that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I have to tell you, when I was doing research for our conversation, I had a big smile on my face when I saw that in your class and in your thinking about strategic communication and communicating about strategy, you talk a lot about how important storytelling is. And I\u2019m curious if you can help us understand what makes a good story about strategy."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, if you think about strategy as an argument, then I think a natural criterion suggests itself, and that criterion is logic. So, a good strategy story on the one hand has a clear narrative to it and you can follow the steps and so on and so forth, but it should also be internally coherent. And that is the realm of logic."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And philosophers and logicians have spent centuries thinking about how do we assess arguments in terms of whether or not \u2014 like, whatever assumptions you\u2019re making, do the assumptions that you do make lead to the conclusion that you think it does? And that is, I think, incredibly important in assessing strategy stories. And where it\u2019s particularly important is when you\u2019re doing strategy for the future, like when you\u2019re trying to say, \u201cHere\u2019s where we want to be in five years, here\u2019s my narrative.\u201d"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Well, think about it. You\u2019re telling a story about something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. And so, how do you know whether that\u2019s a good story? You can say, \u201cWell, it resonates with me. It inspires me,\u201d and those are important and useful criteria. But of course, they could also be foolishness. So, you want to also be able to say, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t know whether all these assumptions are going to be true, and I can\u2019t know until I act. But at least I want to know whether if they are true, will they lead to the outcome that I think they will lead to.\u201d"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"In the book, Glenn and I get into a somewhat technical set of chapters on thinking about what is logical validity and soundness and so on and so forth, which I think a lot of people who are doing strategy are like, where did that come from, and I had stopped thinking about that in eighth grade or something like that. But I do think that holding on to those ideas is like \u2014 The way we should assess each other\u2019s arguments in the first instance is by the extent to which they\u2019re internally coherent."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. And one of the things I strongly advocate whenever you\u2019re creating content, stories, et cetera, that there is a logical coherence, things follow, and that there are premises that you could support."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious to get another dimension of story that I wonder your thoughts on, which is once you have a strategy, you have to propagate it in an organization. And sometimes I think the most effective way to do that is not putting it on posters or little notecards people have. It\u2019s the stories that leaders tell. Do you have experience on that or thoughts on how once we have the strategy, how do we actually communicate it and use story to actually motivate people to align to that strategy?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"First of all, I totally agree with the premise of your question. I do think that communication of these stories is really important. And I would add relentless communication."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"I think one aspect of that is it\u2019s very easy to approach management and leadership as an exercise in giving orders. And I think that\u2019s fine. I think there\u2019s an element to it that\u2019s about giving delegation and giving orders. But maybe give people a little bit of grace in the sense of saying here\u2019s why. Like here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. And just let people into your mind and your logic, because then they\u2019re going to do a better job. I just think that\u2019s the most important thing."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, I think the most you can just be aware of the need to always be communicating what your reasoning is and what your logic is, the better off you\u2019ll be."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I absolutely agree. And if people can internalize your logic, they can then be able to not only know what they need to do and feel confident that it\u2019s the right thing, they can then communicate it to others. So, it becomes a way of propagating that information."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And they can more productively disagree with you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Because then they can say, \u201cOh, but wait a second. You thought that this was going to be true, and it\u2019s not. So now, Boss, we got to do something differently.\u201d It\u2019s not disrespectful or anything like that. It\u2019s just like the world wasn\u2019t the way you thought it was, and I can help you do a better job."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right, and it allows for that immediate feedback so you can make those adjustments, for sure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone. You okay with that?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Yep."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. Here we go. If you were to capture the best communication advice you\u2019ve ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would that be?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"The five to seven words would be: a classroom is a theater. So, I had the pleasure of working \u2014 a number of times, actually \u2014 with a teaching coach named Barbara Lane Brown. And she was a former actor and theater director. And she really helped me think about how when you\u2019re teaching a class, which is obviously a very strong form of communication, you\u2019re putting on a play. And you have to think about it the same way."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, when you\u2019re first starting out, for example, you tend to just, \u201cOkay, let me just start talking,\u201d as opposed to taking command of the room. The play doesn\u2019t start by somebody just wandering out on stage and deciding to start talking. Right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, a good play doesn\u2019t."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"A good play doesn\u2019t. And a good theater performance has different characters. And so, thinking about yourself as an individual and the different characters that you might deploy in the same class, and thinking about engagement with the audience and how you move and all those other kinds of things. It was really powerful for me. It changed the way I taught, and definitely for the better."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I have to say that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised and a bit shocked. I see you as somebody who is \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re a fantastic teacher, and you\u2019re very logical and methodical. And I love that I now see behind the curtain, literally and figuratively, that you think about it as a play. And I think all of us should think about the theater of our communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now I don\u2019t mean we have to be actors, but think about the way the environment\u2019s set up. How are you starting, as you mentioned. How do you end? How do you build excitement? And all of those are things that we can learn from acting. And thank you. That\u2019s fantastic."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"So, having listened to your podcast, I, of course, knew you were going to ask this question. And I\u2019m, in general, terrible at answering questions like who\u2019s your favorite X."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m sorry."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, I was stumped. No, no, no, that\u2019s fine. So, I texted my kids \u2014 my kids are all grown \u2014 and I said how should I answer this question? And one of my sons said, \u201cBill Belichick,\u201d because I\u2019m a big New England Patriots fan. And my other son said, \u201cThe Swedish Chef,\u201d because [we hate] the Muppets. And then my daughter said, \u201cEmmett,\u201d who is our dog, one of our dogs."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And I thought about it. Because what Emmett the dog does, he has this amazing ability to get me up with nonverbal communication at 5:30 in the morning. Like his just ability. So I, too, thought, well, what unifies all those? Because the thing about Bill Belichick, most people would not think of him as a great communicator because he very intentionally, actually, I think is not communicating, doesn\u2019t want to say anything."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, I actually thought while I was trying to make sense of that of like why would they all say that as a response to what they thought I would be. And I think it actually has something to do with nonverbal communication."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And so, then I thought about it some more. And I actually think one of the musicians that I really have always enjoyed and loved is a jazz pianist named Keith Jarrett who has this amazing style of performance. And again, entirely nonverbal. But if you think about the way great musicians use pacing and rhythm and the ability to create drama without ever saying anything."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Because I think what I find hard about this question \u2014 it\u2019s a great question \u2014 but what I find hard about it is it\u2019s so hard to separate the message from the communication style. So, that\u2019s where I think the music helps me think about, okay, I don\u2019t really know what the message is, but I know how it moves me in different kinds of ways."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, first, I am glad that I had an opportunity to bring your family together. I was very curious how you were going to have a football coach, a Muppet, and a pet lead to something. But you\u2019re right, nonverbal communication is critical. And you were one of the very few people to answer this question focused on nonverbals. Most people speak about people who communicate and speak in a certain way."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Question number three: what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"My first ingredient is not going to surprise, given what we have just been talking about. But I think the first ingredient is clarify your logic. So, be really clear about what your argument is. And that saying that clear thinking is what leads to clear writing or clear speaking is really key."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And when I\u2019m oftentimes giving feedback on papers to students or whatever, it\u2019s usually about the writing is a mess until they get to the point where they\u2019re actually clear about what they\u2019re trying to say. Which is oftentimes hard, so that\u2019s not a criticism, but it\u2019s just like that\u2019s the process. And related to that is writing is rewriting. You have to keep doing it. What you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re revising your argument as you go along."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Second ingredient, I think, is imagine what the audience might hear, not just what you say. I think we focus very much on getting the words right, but not enough on what the audience\u2019s perspective is going to be and how they\u2019re going to interpret the words. And I think one of the ways that I got better as a case class teacher was to be able to anticipate better how students were going to interpret a question, like all the different ways they could interpret it. And that, I think, is really key."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"And then I think the last ingredient, I would say, is be all parts of yourself. Which goes back to this idea of the classroom as a theater and you actually have within you many different characters that you deploy at different times: the stern person and the joking person. And that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of using all of them at the appropriate moments in any given communication task."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like that notion of bringing your whole self and giving yourself permission to be who you are when you communicate. That\u2019s very powerful. I feel a lot of us put on this communication person instead of who we are. And that notion of really thinking about the impact of your words on your audience and planning for some of that in advance I think speaks very nicely to your strategic thinking. And clearly logic is critical. We\u2019ve all heard people who just ramble and we wonder why and what makes sense."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, Jesper, thank you so much for joining us. You made quite a convincing strategic argument for the value of strategy. And further, you help0ed us understand what makes for good strategy and good communication as well. Thank you."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Jesper S\u00f8rensen","text":"[Music plays]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

And if you\u2019re a public company, that means how do you maximize profits, perhaps.

I think planning is really about the order of operations. Because the sequence of things that you\u2019re going to do, once you know why it is that you have a reason to do something and what the outcome is going to be. And so, I think strategy is, that sense, much more complicated, because in order to get the resources that you need, you have to engage with other actors. So, you have to engage with your customers and suppliers and so on and so forth, and you don\u2019t have control over them. Planning is about the things that you can control, but strategy is really much more complicated in that sense."]},{"begin":"169.080","end":"176.080","lines":["So, it sounds like planning is much more tactical.

So, I think in a lot of organizations we have this image of strategy being dictated at the top, that the CEO is going to articulate here\u2019s what the strategy is. It\u2019s like a football coach sending the play in from the sideline and then we\u2019re all just going to go and execute."]},{"begin":"218.480","end":"219.320","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"219.320","end":"242.320","lines":["And so, you\u2019ll meet tons of managers who will say, \u201cI don\u2019t do strategy. I\u2019m just about execution.\u201d But of course, strategy is really about how you\u2019re going to best allocate your time and your resources. That\u2019s ultimately what it\u2019s about. And so, if you have any responsibility in the organization, you\u2019re doing strategy. And so, you need to be able to engage with the strategy."]},{"begin":"242.320","end":"268.360","lines":["And I think one of the things that happens is that we disempower ourselves if we think about strategy as that. The related misconception is then that people think of strategy as like a set it once a year or once every five years kind of thing, and then we\u2019re just going to go execute on that plan.

I have been part of several organizations where when people say \u201cWe\u2019re going to strategically plan,\u201d everybody\u2019s eyes roll and they think, oh, we\u2019re just going to put another document on the shelf or it\u2019s just going to sit on some website somewhere.

So, it\u2019s an explanation, and that\u2019s how I do think it\u2019s related to communication. It\u2019s an explanation for how you think you\u2019re going to succeed. And that\u2019s an argument, and an argument is simply a set of assumptions that lead to a conclusion. Right? That force a conclusion."]},{"begin":"364.840","end":"400.320","lines":["And so, what a strategy argument is, it\u2019s a statement about what are the investments and the activities that we are going to undertake that\u2019s going to lead us to be able to create and capture economic value. And if we can do those things, if we can understand the connection between those investments and those activities and how we create economic value and how we capture economic value, then we can start to have sophisticated conversations about what is it that\u2019s working, what is it that\u2019s not working. And it gives us a model through which we can see the world."]},{"begin":"400.320","end":"426.280","lines":["The thing I feel is so powerful about this notion of strategy as an argument is, one, it involves how you think about it. Because when we craft arguments, we think about things like who are we speaking to, what\u2019s the context. And it implies that this is a conversation that has to be had. Again, it\u2019s not some dictation that comes down from somebody. So, I find that really powerful."]},{"begin":"426.280","end":"451.840","lines":["And it also implies in an argument that there is debate and discussion and change and evolution, and I think that\u2019s really, really important. And it fits very nicely with what \u2014 As you know, I teach strategic communication. And while I talk a lot about the importance of communicating strategically, I\u2019m really curious to have you share your thoughts on how communication is important in strategy."]},{"begin":"451.840","end":"465.560","lines":["So, I think there\u2019s two different parts to that. And one, just to key off of what you just said, I do think \u2014 And in the book, Glenn and I, we devote an entire chapter top basically thinking about how can you argue constructively as a group in an organization."]},{"begin":"465.560","end":"480.200","lines":["Oftentimes what we say when we teach, if we teach MBA students or executives, we say, \u201cYou should go and you should argue more in your organizations.\u201d And then a lot of people are then like, \u201cWhoa, no way. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Because what they\u2019re hearing is fight."]},{"begin":"480.200","end":"506.760","lines":["And we\u2019re not saying you should go fight more. Because a fight is kind of like you\u2019re throwing assertions at each other and you\u2019re just waiting for somebody to give in, so it\u2019s like a street fight. But there are ways to structure debates and arguments so that they are constructive. And part of that is about having the ability to listen to somebody else and hear what it is that they\u2019re trying to say and hear what their logic is."]},{"begin":"506.760","end":"528.800","lines":["I think most people believe things for a reason, like they have a reason for believing it. You might disagree both with their conclusion and with some of their reasons, but you can\u2019t engage constructively in a debate unless you hear them on that dimension. And so, really it\u2019s about how do you structure engagements with each other to create that space."]},{"begin":"528.800","end":"549.440","lines":["I think the other part of communicating strategically that\u2019s really important is when we think about delegation. So, what we know is that if you want to build a great organization, you\u2019re not going to be able to do that yourself. You can\u2019t make all the decisions, much as you might want to. And so, we all know that we have to be able to delegate and we have to be able to empower people."]},{"begin":"549.440","end":"580.960","lines":["And we have lots of books that tell us delegation is wonderful, and even the word empowerment sounds so wonderful. But of course, the truth is most leaders wake up at 3:00 in the morning petrified because they\u2019ve delegated a task to somebody else. And what they petrified, what are they scared about? They\u2019re scared that their subordinate is going to make the wrong decision. And at 3:00 in the morning, what is the wrong decision? It\u2019s not the decision I would have made."]},{"begin":"580.960","end":"601.160","lines":["So, there\u2019s this tension. Like on the one hand, you don\u2019t want to make all the decisions.

Or at least you want somebody who might be closer to the information to make a better decision because they have more information, but you want them to think about it the way you think about it."]},{"begin":"601.160","end":"627.920","lines":["And then the question is how do you get people to think about things the way you think about things. That\u2019s through communication. So, that\u2019s about really explaining why you think we win, why you think we are a successful organization, why you think these sets of actions are the things that we need to do in order to accomplish our goals. And so, that\u2019s where I do think really clear communication is going to be essential to effective strategic leadership."]},{"begin":"627.920","end":"658.880","lines":["The fact that you are invoking the power of listening and being willing to engage in conflict, but productive conflict, so we can get to a collaborative place with our strategy is a very different way of thinking about strategy in general. And I think that\u2019s really powerful for all of us to think about. And clearly, being able to articulate your strategy, packaging it and communicating it in a way that not only motivates people, but also helps makes better decisions is absolutely critical, for sure."]},{"begin":"658.880","end":"665.680","lines":["Right. I mean, there\u2019s this element of strategy that we have a \u2014 I think most of our stereotype of what strategy is, is very top down."]},{"begin":"665.680","end":"666.160","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"666.160","end":"683.000","lines":["And so, then you would think communication is just broadcasting.

It\u2019s both top down and bottom up. And so, you have to be able to both be able to articulate what it is that you want to say and where you think we should be going, but then also be able to listen and hear where you might be wrong.

You make assumptions."]},{"begin":"705.160","end":"705.800","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"705.800","end":"724.920","lines":["And assumptions are testable. They\u2019re going to be proven wrong or they\u2019re going to be proven right.

And where it\u2019s particularly important is when you\u2019re doing strategy for the future, like when you\u2019re trying to say, \u201cHere\u2019s where we want to be in five years, here\u2019s my narrative.\u201d"]},{"begin":"813.640","end":"845.160","lines":["Well, think about it.
