Many of us are held back by our fears and concerns about what might happen. Today, we\u2019ll explore having a bias for action and being direct in immediate with our audiences. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today I am super excited to chat with Dan Pink. Dan is the author of five New York Times bestsellers, including his latest, The Power of Regret, How Looking Backward Moves Us Forward. Early in his career, Dan served as a political speech writer, including being chief speech writer to Vice President Al Gore. Welcome, Dan. I am so looking forward to our conversation."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Matt, it is great to be here. A longtime listener, first time guest."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you. There\u2019s so many things that I want to talk about. I just want to jump right in. Many of our listeners find themselves preparing presentations and structuring speeches. Earlier in your career, you served as a speech writer, and I\u2019m curious, what two or three lessons can you share for how to prepare and deliver a great talk?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Well, I mean, political speech writing and political speech giving, I think it can be different from giving a sales presentation or giving a lecture at a university. However, I do think that there are some principles of that realm that we can extract for other realms. So one of them would be audience first. All right? You gotta think about the audience. What do they know? What don\u2019t they know? What do they care about? What don\u2019t they care about? And one of the things that we did, if it allow me a small tangent here, is back when I was working for, as a chief speech writer for Vice President Al Gore, is that when he went out into America, you know, outside of Washington to do things, we would always work massively to find what we called How the hells? Okay how the hell\u2019s, and how the hell would be something like this?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"It\u2019s like he would get up there and say, \u2018Oh man, you know,\u2019 (I\u2019m making this up. You\u2019re in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.) It\u2019s like, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m a little bit late, but I wanted to have a second cinnamon roll at McGillicuddy\u2019s.\u2019 And the reactions to the crowd would be, \u2018how the hell does he know about McGillicuddy\u2019s?\u2019 Everybody in Sheboygan knows about McGillicuddy\u2019s. So, but the idea of thinking of the audience first, I think is a really important principle. Another one would be, which I\u2019m violating right now, is say less. There has never been a speech, certainly political speech, where people at the end of it said, gosh, I wish he or she would\u2019ve talked longer. Say less"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"I remember one time seeing these in the White House. These speeches circulate. There was a speech, not ours that was circulating, and it was a draft of a speech. It was Clinton\u2019s speech where the draft of the speech literally said, \u2018and my plan has 14 pillars.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, this is not going to stand up with 14 pillars. That\u2019s about 11 pillars too many."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"And then the final one is especially for political, but I think it\u2019s true for other realms, is that ultimately you have to think about the purpose. The purpose of the speech is to galvanize action. It\u2019s not to show how smart you are, it\u2019s not to sort of give your own wizardry about your mastery of a topic, especially in political speeches. You want them to do something, you want them to go and vote. You want them to go cater for a higher minimum wage. You want them to try to stop the other side from doing X, Y, or Z. And so when you think about these things, audience first say less, and ultimately you want the audience to act. I think those are helpful lessons for any communicator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely, they are, and they have been echoed in many different ways across this podcast. But having a clear goal, knowing what it is you want, being very concise and connecting your content in a way that\u2019s relevant and meaningful. And I love the \u2018how the hell\u2019 point. And I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s a great thing for people to think about. It\u2019s, it a little specific details that demonstrate you\u2019ve spent time thinking about and appreciating who you\u2019re speaking to can go a long way. I, I really appreciate that."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"I mean this mostly in, in the realm of corporate communication, which includes speech giving, but includes sort of the way, in many ways, the ways that companies interact with their employees and interact with their customers. To me, the embodiment of how to do it wrong is the phrase we apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused you. Now that phrase, which all of us have seen has been said by faceless corporations, but has never been said by a human being. Human beings don\u2019t talk that way. You and I happen to be conversing right now via the magic of the internet. We are not in the same physical space, but suppose that we were in the same physical space, we were in the same studio, and I am a clumsy guy. I guarantee I will knock over the microphone at some point during this conversation."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"So let\u2019s say you and I were together and I had a cup of coffee, and because I talk with my hands because I\u2019m clumsy, maybe I spill the co I spill coffee on you, right? You\u2019re wearing a nice gray sweater. I spill my dark black coffee on your beautiful gray sweater. What would I say under those circumstances? I would not say, \u2018oh, Matt, I\u2019m sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused you.\u2019 What, what would you, I would say, \u2018oh my God, Matt, I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t believe I did that. I\u2019m so sorry. What can I do to make it right?\u2019 And so I think that the more we just forget the performative side of saying, oh, this is how official language is, this is how companies talk, this is how a smart person\u2019s supposed to talk. And we just talk like we talk. I actually think that it\u2019s more compelling what you\u2019re doing, especially with, let\u2019s go back to speeches. I think a lot of written communication as well. What you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re not trying to sound like somebody else. You\u2019re trying simply to sound like a better version of yourself. That\u2019s the key. When I was in college, I was a linguistics major. So if you and one of the few things that you learn in linguistics is the ability to go very meta very quickly. And I can go very meta very quickly on you. When we think about this just in terms of the human species: human beings have been conversing as you and I are, human beings have been conversing for 200,000 years, right?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"It is not anything we learned. We didn\u2019t learn how to converse. It is who we are. It\u2019s part of our evolution as a species. And we\u2019ve been doing it for 200,000 years. We have been writing, you know, written communication for only 5,000 years. Like a fraction of that time written communication is an invention. It is not something we do naturally. And then if you think about the distribution of written information, the printing press, that\u2019s only 500 years-ish old. And so we\u2019re learning how to do this kind of written communication, this formal communication. And for whatever weird reason, we have diverged from what we already do as an evolutionary ability. And so the more you can, I guess, let\u2019s be practical here. The goal has to be to sound like a better version of yourself, not to sound official, not to sound like somebody else, but to sound like a slightly more organized, more coherent version of yourself."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Clearly when we communicate, we want to avoid distancing ourselves from the people we\u2019re talking about. You know, in my field, we talk a lot of what you said resonates in and is captured by this idea of immediacy. You want to connect and you want to be immediate, and you use language that is inviting to people. I recently coached a very senior leader at a tech company, and he was giving a presentation for 3000, 5,000 people. And he started by saying, knowledge workers must, and I stopped him. I said, who\u2019s in the audience? He said, knowledge workers. And I said, so why don\u2019t you just say you all right? I mean, we need to communicate and use language that invites people in and doesn\u2019t distance ourselves. I do think many of us think that to sound smarter, we have to use big words and formal Exactly. Ways of speaking. And what I\u2019m hearing you say is, being a better version of yourself is not using big words, it\u2019s just connecting and really thinking about your point and how it can resonate. Is that right?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Yes. Being a clearer version of yourself, not having this kind of fantastical notion of what official speak is or what smart speak is. And the thing is, it\u2019s like we have in our brains, literally the programming that allows us to do that. That is, like, to me, it takes more cognitive effort for a company to come up with this ridiculous, we\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused you. Rather than saying, \u2018oh my God, we\u2019re so sorry, we messed up.\u2019"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. I love the mantra. Speak like a human. And I think all of us can take the time to practice and run our communications by other people and, and have as, as the first threshold. Did it make sense? And does it sound conversational."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"In your writing and speaking, you\u2019ve studied a lot about persuasion and selling. You talk about focusing on problem finding, not problem solving. Can you define these two concepts and explain how to leverage problem finding in being persuasive in selling?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"So problem solving is addressing a clearly stated issue that already exists and likely has a solution. Problem finding is actually surfacing when people don\u2019t know that it exists right now. Why is one now more important than the other? This is a big deal because problem solving is becoming a commodity. And this is particularly true, this is true throughout white collar work, but it\u2019s particularly true in sales. If I am in the market for, I\u2019m looking around my office here. If I\u2019m in the o, if I\u2019m in the market for a vacuum cleaner and uh, oh my God, my floor is dirty, I need a vacuum cleaner, and you\u2019re a vacuum cleaner salesperson, I don\u2019t really need you very much. I know what I need. I need a vacuum cleaner. I can go online, I can find the best price I can, I can find the best model for that, for that vacuum cleaner."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"You\u2019re not very useful to me. I don\u2019t need you. Right? Your ability to solve that problem and get Dan a vacuum cleaner is meaningless. However, where are you more useful? You\u2019re more useful if that\u2019s not actually my problem, if I\u2019m wrong about my problem. And so maybe the problem is that I have crappy screens on my windows here and all this kind of gunk is getting in here and it doesn\u2019t matter whether I have a vacuum cleaner. So if you can sort of surface a problem that I don\u2019t realize that I have that is more difficult to commodify and therefore there\u2019s a greater premium on problem finding rather than on problem solving."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love this notion of really flipping the script. It\u2019s not about giving the solution, it\u2019s about finding what\u2019s the right problem. And it gets back to something you said earlier about really knowing your audience and understanding their needs can help you find the problems that can be beneficial to them."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Well, that\u2019s a huge question, and I don\u2019t have to offer at the start with mea culpa, because in that book, I don\u2019t think I really got purpose quite right. I think about it differently now than when I wrote that book. No refunds for anybody, but I still think about it differently. There\u2019s still value. There\u2019s still value. Yeah. And so what we think of as purpose, particularly when it comes to on the job, is that I\u2019m going to be more motivated to do something if my job is connected to something larger than myself. So not only am I filing this report or doing this audit, but I\u2019m doing it in the service of stopping the climate crisis. And we have a lot of good evidence in organizational behavior that that is absolutely a performance enhancer. If you go to say, university fundraisers and show them letters from people who were on the receiving end of the money that they raised, or have them meet people who benefited from the money that they raised, they raised money."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"So purpose is an inherent performance enhancer, but there\u2019s also a quieter kind of purpose where you\u2019re not only making a difference, you\u2019re just making a contribution. We can think of one as capital P purpose. My work is solving the climate crisis. I\u2019m feeding the hungry. But there\u2019s another one where you\u2019re just making a contribution. There\u2019s a great study out of Harvard Business School showing that in a cafeteria when they rigged up an iPad that allowed the cooks to see the customers, the quality of the food improved. And what that meant was that the cooks were not getting paid more, the cooks were not feeding the unhoused, the cooks simply saw the purpose of what they were doing. They were making a contribution. And when we think of it, capital P purpose, am I making a difference in the world. Small p purpose, am I just making a contribution?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"I\u2019m cooking a cheese omelet and someone\u2019s going to eat it. I\u2019m going to up my cheese omelet game a bit. My colleague is having difficulty getting a report out the door. I\u2019m going to help her do that. It\u2019s not going to change the world, but it\u2019s a contribution to another human being. I\u2019m at a call center and somebody calls in and they have this problem with their headphones aren\u2019t working properly, and I\u2019m going to solve their problem. I\u2019m not changing the world in any way, but I\u2019m making a contribution. And what we see, it\u2019s really exciting, is that a lot of times, especially in leadership, we\u2019re over-indexed on how leaders always tell people how to do stuff. They don\u2019t explain enough about why what people are doing is important, why it matters, why it connects to making a contribution or making a difference. And as gooey as that sounds, I think there\u2019s almost incontrovertible evidence that why that sense of purpose is the most cost effective performance enhancer that organizations have."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s really a catalyst, right? By helping people understand why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing. And, and it\u2019s predicated of course on leadership, understanding what their mission and vision is, and then helping people understand how they play in that. But that\u2019s a great way to enhance the performance you\u2019re looking for."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"And it goes to what we\u2019re talking about before, which is the importance of the basis of a lot of what you\u2019ve been working on for all these years, which is the importance of conversation. And that management leadership is not about dictation. It\u2019s not about one way direction. It\u2019s about a conversation and a conversation to elicit the very best from people includes instruction and guidance on how to do things, but it also surfaces why people are doing things, why what they do matters, why it connects to something else."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And by empowering people with the why, you can motivate the behavior that you\u2019re seeking. Many of those listening get very anxious and nervous about their communication, be it presenting, making small talks, speaking up in a meeting, asking somebody out on a date. In your newest book, the Power of Regret, you discuss the role of risk as it relates to regret. Can you talk about how our perceived risk often does not match the actual risk and the implications that it might have for our motivations and our anxieties and, and maybe even specifically to communication?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"This is, I think, a big takeaway from that, from that book. In that book, I looked at, this misunderstood emotion of regret. And among the things that I did is I collected regrets. Now we have about 25,000 regrets from around the world, and I also did a big survey of the US population about their attitudes on regret. And one of the things that you see, let\u2019s go start with the US public opinion survey. We did this very large sample to try to find demographic differences in what people regret, how they regret it, so forth. So we oversampled in every demographic category, we spent a lot of money to try to find these demographic differences. And there weren\u2019t that many, but there was one big one that goes directly to your point, which is this: in the architecture of regret, you can have regrets about action and inaction, regrets about what you did and regrets about what you didn\u2019t do."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"People in their twenties had about equal numbers of action and inaction regrets. But as people age, really just almost like into the thirties, but certainly forties, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, the inaction regrets took over. There\u2019s about a three to one, two to one, three to one ratio of regrets of inaction over action. What people regret over time are things they didn\u2019t do. They didn\u2019t take that trip, they didn\u2019t ask that person out on a date. They didn\u2019t start that business. And I think it\u2019s because we are just a slightly over-indexed on risk. We overstate the risk in many circumstances. Now, this is not a lesson to take risks all the time. You want to take smart risks, but I feel like we need to adjust the dial one or two clicks. And this is particularly true when it comes to communication. In what I call the world regret survey, where collected regrets from all over the world."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"One of the big categories of regrets were what I call connection regrets, where you have a friend or someone you care about deeply, but maybe you haven\u2019t talked to them for 10 years. You want to reach out, but it feels really awkward and you think they\u2019re not going to care. So you don\u2019t, that is a colossal mistake because it\u2019s a colossal forecasting error. Because what happens is that when you do reach out, it\u2019s way less awkward than people think. To your point, we\u2019re over assessing the risk. Second, the other side almost always welcomes the overture. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird. And so I do think that there is some pretty good evidence, and we look at regret and what people regret over time, to have that bias for action. To speak up, to reach out to that friend, to ask somebody out on a date to sort of be a little bit more risk prone than we might naturally be. Because over time, what you\u2019re going to regret is not doing that stuff."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So first, Dan, you could have collected all of those regrets just by talking to me. I\u2019ve got about 25,000 myself. So I, yeah, I could have saved you time. I really see in my own work and in the work of others that I know who help people feel more confident speaking that virtually everybody after the fact, after they\u2019ve taken that risk, say, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. And the rewards far outweighed my concerns. So I just wanted to echo what you said there. And yet, we are often burdened by our fear of that risk so that we end up ultimately regretting what could have been. And I hope everybody takes a moment to think of an upcoming situation where you might be hesitant because you\u2019re afraid of the risk, and take it from Dan Pink, go do it. It is worth it. In terms of your communication."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"I think there\u2019s an important lesson here. It\u2019s like, just have that slight bias for action. You know, Nick Epley has researched about, no one thinks that talking to strangers on a train. They think that if you say, if you go up to somebody on a train, are they going to welcome the overture? And the view is like, no way, they\u2019re going to hate it. I\u2019m going to hate it. It\u2019s going to be totally awkward. And that when he did research in the Chicago public transportation system, he found that the people who were on the end of the overtures said that was kind of an interesting conversation. I\u2019m glad that person reached out. The person who was instructed to do that said that was way less awkward than we think. So bottom line here is just have a slight bias for action. I have found in his regret research, especially this emotion of awkwardness, is a paper tiger push through that feeling of awkwardness in any dimension of your life. And, and as you\u2019re saying from the people who you\u2019ve worked with, when you get to the other side of that, you\u2019re typically going to be fine."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. And awkwardness is a big impediment to communication. And if we just try it, we often find it\u2019s not as bad as we thought. In your book, when the scientific secrets of perfect timing, you give a lot of advice on how to maximize our motivation and take care of ourselves in this incredibly fast paced always on world that we live. What are two bits of advice you might have for us for how to thrive and sustain ourselves?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Well, I guess the first one would be, once again, the all like research base. We have some pretty good evidence that our cognitive abilities do not remain constant over the course of the day. They change, they change in material ways. And so being conscious and intentional about doing the right kind of work at the right time of day can make a huge, huge difference. And unfortunately, we\u2019re often very intentional about what we do. We\u2019re intentional about how we do it and who we do it with. But when it comes to when we do stuff, we\u2019re not intentional and we should be because it actually matters. The second thing that I would say is take more breaks. Initially, in that book on timing, I was going to write about maybe two pages on breaks in the chapter on this hidden pattern of the day. And there was so much research and so good research that I ended up writing an entire chapter on breaks."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"And what we should be doing, it\u2019s a reframing of sorts. We should be thinking of breaks differently. We should be thinking of breaks as part of our performance, not as a deviation from our performance. We have been sold a bill of goods by the Puritans who said that the only way to get more work done and better work done is to power through. And that when you power through, that\u2019s also morally virtuous. That\u2019s complete nonsense. What we know from many domains is that professionals take breaks. It\u2019s not let amateurs take breaks and don\u2019t, it\u2019s the exact opposite. Professionals take breaks, amateurs don\u2019t take breaks. So be intentional about your breaks and where you can, the best kinds of breaks are when you\u2019re in motion, when you\u2019re outside, when you\u2019re detached from your phone or even from your work, and often when you\u2019re with somebody else. So even taking like a 15 minute walk break every afternoon can be powerfully helpful in sustaining your intellectual and, uh, physical energy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think taking a break in conversation and in the work we do, very, very important. And this notion of timing of when things work best for you is really powerful. We\u2019ve had Baba Shiv, who is one of our faculty here at Stanford\u2019s Business School who has studied this, and it\u2019s fascinating that we are more collaborative and creative at certain times of the day, and it\u2019s better to try to harness the, the type of activity we do that fits with those rhythms and absolutely taking breaks, taking time to disconnect can be really, really powerful. So Dan, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. And I am really curious and excited to hear your answers. Are you up for these?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Question one. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Decide the promise you\u2019re making, then deliver."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Okay. And then I\u2019ll unpack that very quickly. So, years ago I was working on, back in the old days when there were magazines, I wrote a lot for magazines. And, you know, I\u2019d write these fairly long feature stories, 4,000, 5,000 words. And at one point, you know, I was stuck on something. I, I submitted a draft, it was terrible, and I was really stuck. And my editor said to me, it\u2019s like, okay, I know the problem here. You don\u2019t know what promise you\u2019re making to the reader. What promise are you making to the reader in this piece? And I was like, what? And that was really enlightening to me. I think hard about that. And what I\u2019m writing when I\u2019m talking is like, what\u2019s the promise I\u2019m making to the reader or the listener? And am I fulfilling that promise? So, decide the promise you\u2019re making and then deliver."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that is really powerful. Know your goal, know your intention, and then act on it. Very good. You know, so many people and you\u2019ve had such a fascinating life. Question number two: Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Okay, so I think my choice is not somebody I know. Not only is it not somebody I know, but it\u2019s not somebody who\u2019s alive. And it\u2019s somebody who might not be a somebody. I was thinking about this during my walk. I took a walk right after lunch and before I did this talk with you. And I was thinking, Aesop. When you think about it, Aesop had these parables, these fables, they were probably 150 words long. They have withstood the test of time to put it mildly and they\u2019ve lodged in our brain so powerfully that you can use phrases like tortoise in the hare or sour grapes, or, you know, the grasshopper, and it sticks. And that\u2019s pretty good. So I\u2019m going to vote for Aesop."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You have truly gone old school. You are, you, you have brought up the oldest suggested great communicator, and you clearly have highlighted some things that are important for good communicators, something that\u2019s memorable, being concise, creating something that has the impact."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Question number three, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"Number one, simplicity. Number two, Brevity."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I see what you did there."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"And I\u2019m not even going to use my third."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I know, I saw that. Simplicity and brevity, make it accessible, make it understandable, make it memorable. All very powerful bits of advice and guidance. And Dan, everything you\u2019ve shared with us has been powerful. It has been such a pleasure to chat with you. Hey, thanks. The, the notion of being human and connecting with humans, knowing our purpose, and really understanding our promise and having a bias for action, all of these are really powerful. Thank you so much. I wish you well on your new book, The Power of Regret, and I appreciate your time."},{"author":"Dan Pink","text":"What a pleasure, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Many of our listeners find themselves preparing presentations and structuring speeches.

However, I do think that there are some principles of that realm that we can extract for other realms. So one of them would be audience first. All right? You gotta think about the audience. What do they know? What don\u2019t they know? What do they care about? What don\u2019t they care about? And one of the things that we did, if it allow me a small tangent here, is back when I was working for, as a chief speech writer for Vice President Al Gore, is that when he went out into America, you know, outside of Washington to do things, we would always work massively to find what we called How the hells? Okay how the hell\u2019s, and how the hell would be something like this?"]},{"begin":"120.240","end":"153.960","lines":["It\u2019s like he would get up there and say, \u2018Oh man, you know,\u2019 (I\u2019m making this up.

It\u2019s like, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m a little bit late, but I wanted to have a second cinnamon roll at McGillicuddy\u2019s.\u2019 And the reactions to the crowd would be, \u2018how the hell does he know about McGillicuddy\u2019s?\u2019 Everybody in Sheboygan knows about McGillicuddy\u2019s. So, but the idea of thinking of the audience first, I think is a really important principle. Another one would be, which I\u2019m violating right now, is say less. There has never been a speech, certainly political speech, where people at the end of it said, gosh, I wish he or she would\u2019ve talked longer. Say less"]},{"begin":"153.960","end":"176.440","lines":["I remember one time seeing these in the White House. These speeches circulate.

That\u2019s about 11 pillars too many."]},{"begin":"176.440","end":"216.560","lines":["And then the final one is especially for political, but I think it\u2019s true for other realms, is that ultimately you have to think about the purpose. The purpose of the speech is to galvanize action. It\u2019s not to show how smart you are, it\u2019s not to sort of give your own wizardry about your mastery of a topic, especially in political speeches. You want them to do something, you want them to go and vote. You want them to go cater for a higher minimum wage. You want them to try to stop the other side from doing X, Y, or Z. And so when you think about these things, audience first say less, and ultimately you want the audience to act. I think those are helpful lessons for any communicator."]},{"begin":"216.560","end":"260.880","lines":["Absolutely, they are, and they have been echoed in many different ways across this podcast.

And I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s a great thing for people to think about. It\u2019s, it a little specific details that demonstrate you\u2019ve spent time thinking about and appreciating who you\u2019re speaking to can go a long way. I, I really appreciate that."]},{"begin":"260.880","end":"311.880","lines":["I mean this mostly in, in the realm of corporate communication, which includes speech giving, but includes sort of the way, in many ways, the ways that companies interact with their employees and interact with their customers. To me, the embodiment of how to do it wrong is the phrase we apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused you. Now that phrase, which all of us have seen has been said by faceless corporations, but has never been said by a human being. Human beings don\u2019t talk that way. You and I happen to be conversing right now via the magic of the internet. We are not in the same physical space, but suppose that we were in the same physical space, we were in the same studio, and I am a clumsy guy. I guarantee I will knock over the microphone at some point during this conversation."]},{"begin":"311.880","end":"397.960","lines":["So let\u2019s say you and I were together and I had a cup of coffee, and because I talk with my hands because I\u2019m clumsy, maybe I spill the co I spill coffee on you, right? You\u2019re wearing a nice gray sweater. I spill my dark black coffee on your beautiful gray sweater. What would I say under those circumstances? I would not say, \u2018oh, Matt, I\u2019m sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused you.\u2019 What, what would you, I would say, \u2018oh my God, Matt, I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t believe I did that. I\u2019m so sorry. What can I do to make it right?\u2019 And so I think that the more we just forget the performative side of saying, oh, this is how official language is, this is how companies talk, this is how a smart person\u2019s supposed to talk. And we just talk like we talk. I actually think that it\u2019s more compelling what you\u2019re doing, especially with, let\u2019s go back to speeches. I think a lot of written communication as well. What you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re not trying to sound like somebody else. You\u2019re trying simply to sound like a better version of yourself. That\u2019s the key. When I was in college, I was a linguistics major. So if you and one of the few things that you learn in linguistics is the ability to go very meta very quickly. And I can go very meta very quickly on you. When we think about this just in terms of the human species: human beings have been conversing as you and I are, human beings have been conversing for 200,000 years, right?"]},{"begin":"397.960","end":"456.400","lines":["It is not anything we learned. We didn\u2019t learn how to converse. It is who we are. It\u2019s part of our evolution as a species. And we\u2019ve been doing it for 200,000 years. We have been writing, you know, written communication for only 5,000 years. Like a fraction of that time written communication is an invention. It is not something we do naturally. And then if you think about the distribution of written information, the printing press, that\u2019s only 500 years-ish old. And so we\u2019re learning how to do this kind of written communication, this formal communication. And for whatever weird reason, we have diverged from what we already do as an evolutionary ability. And so the more you can, I guess, let\u2019s be practical here. The goal has to be to sound like a better version of yourself, not to sound official, not to sound like somebody else, but to sound like a slightly more organized, more coherent version of yourself."]},{"begin":"456.400","end":"514.280","lines":["Clearly when we communicate, we want to avoid distancing ourselves from the people we\u2019re talking about. You know, in my field, we talk a lot of what you said resonates in and is captured by this idea of immediacy. You want to connect and you want to be immediate, and you use language that is inviting to people. I recently coached a very senior leader at a tech company, and he was giving a presentation for 3000, 5,000 people. And he started by saying, knowledge workers must, and I stopped him. I said, who\u2019s in the audience? He said, knowledge workers. And I said, so why don\u2019t you just say you all right? I mean, we need to communicate and use language that invites people in and doesn\u2019t distance ourselves. I do think many of us think that to sound smarter, we have to use big words and formal Exactly. Ways of speaking. And what I\u2019m hearing you say is, being a better version of yourself is not using big words, it\u2019s just connecting and really thinking about your point and how it can resonate. Is that right?"]},{"begin":"514.280","end":"542.360","lines":["Yes. Being a clearer version of yourself, not having this kind of fantastical notion of what official speak is or what smart speak is. And the thing is, it\u2019s like we have in our brains, literally the programming that allows us to do that.

Rather than saying, \u2018oh my God, we\u2019re so sorry, we messed up.\u2019"]},{"begin":"542.360","end":"555.560","lines":["Absolutely. I love the mantra. Speak like a human.

Problem finding is actually surfacing when people don\u2019t know that it exists right now. Why is one now more important than the other?

If I\u2019m in the o, if I\u2019m in the market for a vacuum cleaner and uh, oh my God, my floor is dirty, I need a vacuum cleaner, and you\u2019re a vacuum cleaner salesperson, I don\u2019t really need you very much.

And so maybe the problem is that I have crappy screens on my windows here and all this kind of gunk is getting in here and it doesn\u2019t matter whether I have a vacuum cleaner. So if you can sort of surface a problem that I don\u2019t realize that I have that is more difficult to commodify and therefore there\u2019s a greater premium on problem finding rather than on problem solving."]},{"begin":"659.800","end":"678.000","lines":["I love this notion of really flipping the script.

And so what we think of as purpose, particularly when it comes to on the job, is that I\u2019m going to be more motivated to do something if my job is connected to something larger than myself. So not only am I filing this report or doing this audit, but I\u2019m doing it in the service of stopping the climate crisis. And we have a lot of good evidence in organizational behavior that that is absolutely a performance enhancer.

There\u2019s a great study out of Harvard Business School showing that in a cafeteria when they rigged up an iPad that allowed the cooks to see the customers, the quality of the food improved. And what that meant was that the cooks were not getting paid more, the cooks were not feeding the unhoused, the cooks simply saw the purpose of what they were doing. They were making a contribution. And when we think of it, capital P purpose, am I making a difference in the world. Small p purpose, am I just making a contribution?"]},{"begin":"790.960","end":"840.520","lines":["I\u2019m cooking a cheese omelet and someone\u2019s going to eat it. I\u2019m going to up my cheese omelet game a bit. My colleague is having difficulty getting a report out the door. I\u2019m going to help her do that. It\u2019s not going to change the world, but it\u2019s a contribution to another human being. I\u2019m at a call center and somebody calls in and they have this problem with their headphones aren\u2019t working properly, and I\u2019m going to solve their problem. I\u2019m not changing the world in any way, but I\u2019m making a contribution. And what we see, it\u2019s really exciting, is that a lot of times, especially in leadership, we\u2019re over-indexed on how leaders always tell people how to do stuff. They don\u2019t explain enough about why what people are doing is important, why it matters, why it connects to making a contribution or making a difference. And as gooey as that sounds, I think there\u2019s almost incontrovertible evidence that why that sense of purpose is the most cost effective performance enhancer that organizations have."]},{"begin":"840.520","end":"856.160","lines":["It\u2019s really a catalyst, right?

But that\u2019s a great way to enhance the performance you\u2019re looking for."]},{"begin":"856.160","end":"884.720","lines":["And it goes to what we\u2019re talking about before, which is the importance of the basis of a lot of what you\u2019ve been working on for all these years, which is the importance of conversation. And that management leadership is not about dictation. It\u2019s not about one way direction. It\u2019s about a conversation and a conversation to elicit the very best from people includes instruction and guidance on how to do things, but it also surfaces why people are doing things, why what they do matters, why it connects to something else."]},{"begin":"884.720","end":"917.600","lines":["And by empowering people with the why, you can motivate the behavior that you\u2019re seeking. Many of those listening get very anxious and nervous about their communication, be it presenting, making small talks, speaking up in a meeting, asking somebody out on a date. In your newest book, the Power of Regret, you discuss the role of risk as it relates to regret. Can you talk about how our perceived risk often does not match the actual risk and the implications that it might have for our motivations and our anxieties and, and maybe even specifically to communication?"]},{"begin":"917.600","end":"963.520","lines":["This is, I think, a big takeaway from that, from that book. In that book, I looked at, this misunderstood emotion of regret. And among the things that I did is I collected regrets. Now we have about 25,000 regrets from around the world, and I also did a big survey of the US population about their attitudes on regret. And one of the things that you see, let\u2019s go start with the US public opinion survey. We did this very large sample to try to find demographic differences in what people regret, how they regret it, so forth. So we oversampled in every demographic category, we spent a lot of money to try to find these demographic differences. And there weren\u2019t that many, but there was one big one that goes directly to your point, which is this: in the architecture of regret, you can have regrets about action and inaction, regrets about what you did and regrets about what you didn\u2019t do."]},{"begin":"963.520","end":"1014.960","lines":["People in their twenties had about equal numbers of action and inaction regrets. But as people age, really just almost like into the thirties, but certainly forties, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, the inaction regrets took over. There\u2019s about a three to one, two to one, three to one ratio of regrets of inaction over action. What people regret over time are things they didn\u2019t do. They didn\u2019t take that trip, they didn\u2019t ask that person out on a date. They didn\u2019t start that business. And I think it\u2019s because we are just a slightly over-indexed on risk. We overstate the risk in many circumstances. Now, this is not a lesson to take risks all the time. You want to take smart risks, but I feel like we need to adjust the dial one or two clicks. And this is particularly true when it comes to communication. In what I call the world regret survey, where collected regrets from all over the world."]},{"begin":"1014.960","end":"1075.520","lines":["One of the big categories of regrets were what I call connection regrets, where you have a friend or someone you care about deeply, but maybe you haven\u2019t talked to them for 10 years. You want to reach out, but it feels really awkward and you think they\u2019re not going to care. So you don\u2019t, that is a colossal mistake because it\u2019s a colossal forecasting error. Because what happens is that when you do reach out, it\u2019s way less awkward than people think. To your point, we\u2019re over assessing the risk. Second, the other side almost always welcomes the overture. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird. And so I do think that there is some pretty good evidence, and we look at regret and what people regret over time, to have that bias for action. To speak up, to reach out to that friend, to ask somebody out on a date to sort of be a little bit more risk prone than we might naturally be. Because over time, what you\u2019re going to regret is not doing that stuff."]},{"begin":"1075.520","end":"1123.040","lines":["So first, Dan, you could have collected all of those regrets just by talking to me. I\u2019ve got about 25,000 myself. So I, yeah, I could have saved you time. I really see in my own work and in the work of others that I know who help people feel more confident speaking that virtually everybody after the fact, after they\u2019ve taken that risk, say, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. And the rewards far outweighed my concerns. So I just wanted to echo what you said there. And yet, we are often burdened by our fear of that risk so that we end up ultimately regretting what could have been. And I hope everybody takes a moment to think of an upcoming situation where you might be hesitant because you\u2019re afraid of the risk, and take it from Dan Pink, go do it. It is worth it. In terms of your communication."]},{"begin":"1123.040","end":"1172.320","lines":["I think there\u2019s an important lesson here. It\u2019s like, just have that slight bias for action. You know, Nick Epley has researched about, no one thinks that talking to strangers on a train. They think that if you say, if you go up to somebody on a train, are they going to welcome the overture? And the view is like, no way, they\u2019re going to hate it. I\u2019m going to hate it. It\u2019s going to be totally awkward. And that when he did research in the Chicago public transportation system, he found that the people who were on the end of the overtures said that was kind of an interesting conversation. I\u2019m glad that person reached out. The person who was instructed to do that said that was way less awkward than we think. So bottom line here is just have a slight bias for action. I have found in his regret research, especially this emotion of awkwardness, is a paper tiger push through that feeling of awkwardness in any dimension of your life. And, and as you\u2019re saying from the people who you\u2019ve worked with, when you get to the other side of that, you\u2019re typically going to be fine."]},{"begin":"1172.320","end":"1200.520","lines":["Absolutely. And awkwardness is a big impediment to communication. And if we just try it, we often find it\u2019s not as bad as we thought. In your book, when the scientific secrets of perfect timing, you give a lot of advice on how to maximize our motivation and take care of ourselves in this incredibly fast paced always on world that we live. What are two bits of advice you might have for us for how to thrive and sustain ourselves?"]},{"begin":"1200.520","end":"1249.480","lines":["Well, I guess the first one would be, once again, the all like research base. We have some pretty good evidence that our cognitive abilities do not remain constant over the course of the day. They change, they change in material ways. And so being conscious and intentional about doing the right kind of work at the right time of day can make a huge, huge difference. And unfortunately, we\u2019re often very intentional about what we do. We\u2019re intentional about how we do it and who we do it with. But when it comes to when we do stuff, we\u2019re not intentional and we should be because it actually matters. The second thing that I would say is take more breaks. Initially, in that book on timing, I was going to write about maybe two pages on breaks in the chapter on this hidden pattern of the day. And there was so much research and so good research that I ended up writing an entire chapter on breaks."]},{"begin":"1249.480","end":"1307.960","lines":["And what we should be doing, it\u2019s a reframing of sorts. We should be thinking of breaks differently. We should be thinking of breaks as part of our performance, not as a deviation from our performance. We have been sold a bill of goods by the Puritans who said that the only way to get more work done and better work done is to power through. And that when you power through, that\u2019s also morally virtuous. That\u2019s complete nonsense. What we know from many domains is that professionals take breaks. It\u2019s not let amateurs take breaks and don\u2019t, it\u2019s the exact opposite. Professionals take breaks, amateurs don\u2019t take breaks. So be intentional about your breaks and where you can, the best kinds of breaks are when you\u2019re in motion, when you\u2019re outside, when you\u2019re detached from your phone or even from your work, and often when you\u2019re with somebody else. So even taking like a 15 minute walk break every afternoon can be powerfully helpful in sustaining your intellectual and, uh, physical energy."]},{"begin":"1307.960","end":"1348.440","lines":["I think taking a break in conversation and in the work we do, very, very important. And this notion of timing of when things work best for you is really powerful. We\u2019ve had Baba Shiv, who is one of our faculty here at Stanford\u2019s Business School who has studied this, and it\u2019s fascinating that we are more collaborative and creative at certain times of the day, and it\u2019s better to try to harness the, the type of activity we do that fits with those rhythms and absolutely taking breaks, taking time to disconnect can be really, really powerful.

And, you know, I\u2019d write these fairly long feature stories, 4,000, 5,000 words. And at one point, you know, I was stuck on something. I, I submitted a draft, it was terrible, and I was really stuck. And my editor said to me, it\u2019s like, okay, I know the problem here. You don\u2019t know what promise you\u2019re making to the reader. What promise are you making to the reader in this piece? And I was like, what? And that was really enlightening to me. I think hard about that. And what I\u2019m writing when I\u2019m talking is like, what\u2019s the promise I\u2019m making to the reader or the listener? And am I fulfilling that promise?

I took a walk right after lunch and before I did this talk with you. And I was thinking, Aesop. When you think about it, Aesop had these parables, these fables, they were probably 150 words long. They have withstood the test of time to put it mildly and they\u2019ve lodged in our brain so powerfully that you can use phrases like tortoise in the hare or sour grapes, or, you know, the grasshopper, and it sticks.
