I became curious about the self when I read Brian Lowery\u2019s new book, Selfless: The Social Creation of \u2018You.\u2019 And the fascinating thing about the self is it\u2019s created by others and empowered through our relationships and communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to a Quick Thinks episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast. To learn more, we invited Brian Lowery back. Brian is a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and he also codirects Stanford\u2019s Institute of Race."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Brian, it is fantastic to have you back. You certainly have been really, really busy. I\u2019m excited to listen regularly to your new podcast, and today I got my copy of your book, Selfless: The Social Creation of You, and I want to probe that idea in a second. But I\u2019m tantalized and intrigued by what follows the colon of your title, \u201cThe Social Creation of You.\u201d Can you share a little bit about what\u2019s behind that?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"Of course. So in social science, people will say the self is a social construction. And what they really mean is who you are is created by the relationships and people around you. And what\u2019s amazing about that is very few people have that experience of themselves. Like most people, I assume you, too, have this sense of like I\u2019m in my head, looking out of my eyes, making decisions, talking to people. Sometimes I make good ones, sometimes bad ones, but I\u2019m in there somewhere. But when you examine it, you know that can\u2019t be true. There\u2019s no little you in there."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"And so the question becomes, what are you? What are you? And the answer now is something like I\u2019m my brain. But that\u2019s not quite right either. I\u2019m this physical thing. Because your physical thing changes all the time, but you don\u2019t have this sense that that\u2019s you, that you have now changed because there\u2019s been some physical change. The argument I make in the book is that the you you\u2019re talking about is the relationships you have, the social interactions you have, and the cultural context you exist in. That isn\u2019t affecting you. That is constituting who you are. That is who you are."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"And in that sense, the self \u2014 and this is a really important part of the book \u2014 the self is incompatible with freedom the way most people understand it because the self is a constraint. The self is a definition in terms of the way other people see you. To be a man, to be black or white, to be Asian or to be a doctor, all these things are about how people understand you and interact with you and limit what you can be. And in limiting what you can be, they make you who you are."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. There\u2019s so much there to unpack. So if I heard you correctly, it\u2019s we are the sum of the relationships we have. And by definition of those relationships, how people define us, that limits what we potentially could be. Are there things we can do to work to change how people see us or perhaps the people we associate with to give us a little bit more freedom? Is that possible?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"You know, this is a \u2014 you have to read the book."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I will, I will."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"[Laughs] But I think fundamentally, a self and ultimate freedom are incompatible. And so for some people that sounds bad because freedom has, at least in our culture, this kind of virtue associated with it. Like everybody wants freedom, and more freedom is just better. But that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019d argue that\u2019s not true. People don\u2019t really believe that, meaning that it feels good to have people know you. Like when you engage with someone and they engage with you in a way that feels right and you feel seen, people love that and need that. But that requires limitations of what you are. That is an acceptance of an absence of a certain type of freedom."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"So I think people don\u2019t really want freedom in the way they imagine they do or not as much as they think they do. And the way you can expand \u2014 and I think the self is fundamentally a limiting idea, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be expanded. You can expand it by engaging with more people with diverse perspectives because it turns out \u2014 and there\u2019s research on this \u2014 that we actually take other people\u2019s selves into our own. So if you think about your closest relationships, you can think about how much overlap is there between you and that person, right? And the closer the relationship, the more people will say there\u2019s overlap in who we are. And so you can expand the self by deepening the relationships you have."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I certainly know in my closest relationships with my wife, my kids, my close friends, that there is the taking on of other characteristics. I\u2019m curious \u2014 so in graduate school when I was studying relationships and communication within relationships, there was this notion that you and the person you\u2019re in a relationship with are your individual selves, but together you create a collective self. Is that something that resonates with your point of view, or is that something that\u2019s archaic and back from the good old days when I [laughs] was in school?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"Well, I guess what I would say is like I don\u2019t know what the individual self is in the way that\u2019s described. So I think people have this idea of I exist as an island and I bump into other islands, and then we can create something together. What I would say is you are, in some sense, an amalgamation, a combination, a mixture of all those relationships that, whenever you interact with someone, there\u2019s an exchange of self in some ways. So I can give you an example in terms of research. So if you meet someone, you have beliefs about what they believe, right?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"So you see someone, I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re driving a truck and they have an American flag. You have a belief about this person. It might be right; it might not be right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"If you want to have a relationship with that person, associations you have in your own head that you might not even be aware of, that you might not even know are there, will shift in the direction of your belief about that other person\u2019s attitudes. So in some sense, your self is changing to accommodate other people because you want to have a relationship with them, that having a relationship with someone demands in some sense a shift in who you currently are. So in that way, there\u2019s an intermeshing of selves that happens at a level that you\u2019re not even aware of and probably aren\u2019t controlling."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"And that is what\u2019s happening all the time in our lives as we navigate the world. And in close relationships, it\u2019s more intense."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Brian, that\u2019s absolutely fascinating to me because part of what I heard you say is that we have this construction of ourselves that feels permanent, like I know who I am, but in fact, it\u2019s constantly changing. And in some cases, I\u2019m choosing to change it by choosing to engage with someone. Are there things I can do in the moment when I\u2019m in that situation, meeting somebody new or deepening a relationship that I have, that I can perhaps prepare myself better to expand that connection or relationship?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"Yeah. So one is put your phone down [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"He means in theory. I don\u2019t have my phone right now."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"[Laughs] Approach relationships with curiosity. That\u2019s actually really important. And three, here\u2019s maybe one that will be a bit surprising to people: We often are afraid to ask what we consider personal questions because we think it\u2019s going to upset other people, right? We imagine if we ask this question, they\u2019re going to be like, well, who are you to ask me that question? Whether they say it or not, they\u2019ll be thinking that, and we want to avoid that discomfort. It turns out that research suggests that people actually are not put off by what most people think of as personal questions."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"And so you can ask more intimate questions than you imagine. So I\u2019m not going to say go out and ask the most intimate question you can imagine. But I would say move towards asking more personal questions than you might imagine you could, just a step further. And that provides an opportunity to initiate a more meaningful interaction, even if it doesn\u2019t become a relationship. We don\u2019t take seriously enough some of the light interactions we have day to day, and those things turn out to affect us. Our mood is affected by the fleeting interactions we have that we don\u2019t take that seriously."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"So another thing to do is, one, curiosity; two, be willing to ask questions that may be a little bit more \u2014 a step more personal than you typically would. And three, take more seriously those fleeting interactions that you often just think of as a toss-away."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Those are very actionable. And underlying at least of the three bits of advice is communication. And you know that\u2019s something we focus a lot on here. Brian, I\u2019m really intrigued by this notion that we can benefit by probing a little deeper and getting a little more personal in conversations. I think you\u2019re right; many of us feel awkward and uncomfortable, especially if we\u2019re not really close to the people we\u2019re talking to. Do you have advice or guidance that you\u2019ve seen in your own life or you\u2019ve recommended to people about types of questions or ways to do that inquiry?"},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"I\u2019ll actually just say this is not my idea. There\u2019s research on this, and I will send you this site; you can put it up on the website so \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Please do."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"\u2014 people can read the academic paper. I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I want to make sure that people get credit for their ideas. One of the things that I think about is asking people \u2014 like when we interact with people like that we don\u2019t know very well, we often ask very, very superficial questions"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"How\u2019s the weather? Where are you going to go? Have you been to this place? I think one question that is easy to ask people, that is not that personal but it takes you a little bit deeper is, what are you most excited about in life right now? I mean, there\u2019re just easy questions you can ask that no one would be, I think, bothered by. And then once they answer, it\u2019s like follow-up questions become much easier. You know, the way you form relationships is reciprocal escalating disclosure. And so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve talked about that, but if people haven\u2019t heard it, it\u2019s just like when someone says something to you, they disclose a little bit. And then when you reciprocate, you disclose a little bit more, and it escalates. That\u2019s the way that people basically form relationships."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"So if you think about relationships in your life, that\u2019s often how they happen. And what you want to do is initiate that, right, with someone new. And so finding a way to sometimes ask for disclosure that people feel comfortable with, and then reciprocating a step deeper is a way to kick off a relationship, a way to expand like what you know about that person, what they know about you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So you start by expressing curiosity at a slightly deeper level and then reciprocate when you get a response. The final question, I\u2019m curious, how has your self changed in doing the work that you\u2019ve done in terms of writing the book, the podcast, the teaching that you do? It seems to me that, by your definition of self, it must have changed."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"Oh, it has to [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right, right. So I\u2019m taking your advice for granted, asking a slightly more personal question. I\u2019m just curious."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"I\u2019ll [answer] your question. One thing that I \u2014 in writing a book, I became something else, right? And I still don\u2019t know what that something else. I\u2019m like a baby in this new self. And it generates an appreciation for what it means for the self to constantly evolve and change. I think we often don\u2019t really pay enough attention to the ways we change, and maybe we\u2019re harder on ourselves than we should be. Like I\u2019m brand-new at this thing, but it\u2019s not just this thing. It\u2019s, to some extent, who I am and how people are engaging with me and how I\u2019m engaging with them. And trying to figure all that out is not easy."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"And I think there\u2019s a degree of compassion I\u2019ve learned in writing this book. When people\u2019s identities are both challenged, their sense of self is challenged, and / or it shifts or grows, there\u2019s a recognition of when we engage with people, we are asking something of them. And I think I have a better appreciation for that, for the requests that my person makes of other people, right, of the ones that I make of other people and what that demands from others, and also when people do it to me, what it \u2014 it\u2019s an offer. I think of it as an opportunity and an offer that person is making to me, an offer of expansion. And I can accept it or reject that for whatever reasons, but it is an offer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really appreciate that you\u2019ve come to a realization or explored something that we talked about many, many episodes ago in the terms of improvisation, that life and encounters in life can be perceived as opportunities and offers, and they allow you to expand. And I think that\u2019s really interesting. And the other thing that caught my mind is there are certain situations in our lives where there\u2019s a gate that changes ourselves. Like you published a book. You are now an author. Your self has changed. And then there are other things that happen in our lives that are much more subtle that change us. I mean, those of us who have become parents, when your child is born, that\u2019s a change in self."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I recall back when I graduated college and even graduate school, it felt like this big change I was working for, and nothing really changed [laughs]."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It was I had this thing on the wall. So what you made me think about is how our self changes constantly. And yet sometimes it\u2019s very significant and publicly noticed, and other times it\u2019s very subtle and not noticed. And sometimes we think are big changes end up not being. You\u2019ve made me think a lot, Brian, and that\u2019s what I appreciate so much about you."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Your podcast, Know What You See, and your book, Selfless: The Social Creation of \u2018You\u2019 really do make us think. And I appreciate that, and I appreciate your time today. Thank you."},{"author":"Brian Lowery","text":"Thank you so much having me.

You certainly have been really, really busy. I\u2019m excited to listen regularly to your new podcast, and today I got my copy of your book, Selfless: The Social Creation of You, and I want to probe that idea in a second. But I\u2019m tantalized and intrigued by what follows the colon of your title, \u201cThe Social Creation of You.\u201d Can you share a little bit about what\u2019s behind that?"]},{"begin":"69.080","end":"100.720","lines":["Of course. So in social science, people will say the self is a social construction. And what they really mean is who you are is created by the relationships and people around you. And what\u2019s amazing about that is very few people have that experience of themselves. Like most people, I assume you, too, have this sense of like I\u2019m in my head, looking out of my eyes, making decisions, talking to people. Sometimes I make good ones, sometimes bad ones, but I\u2019m in there somewhere. But when you examine it, you know that can\u2019t be true. There\u2019s no little you in there."]},{"begin":"100.720","end":"137.520","lines":["And so the question becomes, what are you? What are you? And the answer now is something like I\u2019m my brain. But that\u2019s not quite right either. I\u2019m this physical thing. Because your physical thing changes all the time, but you don\u2019t have this sense that that\u2019s you, that you have now changed because there\u2019s been some physical change. The argument I make in the book is that the you you\u2019re talking about is the relationships you have, the social interactions you have, and the cultural context you exist in. That isn\u2019t affecting you. That is constituting who you are. That is who you are."]},{"begin":"137.520","end":"171.880","lines":["And in that sense, the self \u2014 and this is a really important part of the book \u2014 the self is incompatible with freedom the way most people understand it because the self is a constraint. The self is a definition in terms of the way other people see you. To be a man, to be black or white, to be Asian or to be a doctor, all these things are about how people understand you and interact with you and limit what you can be. And in limiting what you can be, they make you who you are."]},{"begin":"171.880","end":"199.640","lines":["Wow. There\u2019s so much there to unpack. So if I heard you correctly, it\u2019s we are the sum of the relationships we have. And by definition of those relationships, how people define us, that limits what we potentially could be. Are there things we can do to work to change how people see us or perhaps the people we associate with to give us a little bit more freedom? Is that possible?"]},{"begin":"199.640","end":"201.680","lines":["You know, this is a \u2014 you have to read the book."]},{"begin":"201.680","end":"202.960","lines":["I will, I will."]},{"begin":"202.960","end":"239.840","lines":["[Laughs] But I think fundamentally, a self and ultimate freedom are incompatible. And so for some people that sounds bad because freedom has, at least in our culture, this kind of virtue associated with it. Like everybody wants freedom, and more freedom is just better. But that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019d argue that\u2019s not true. People don\u2019t really believe that, meaning that it feels good to have people know you. Like when you engage with someone and they engage with you in a way that feels right and you feel seen, people love that and need that. But that requires limitations of what you are. That is an acceptance of an absence of a certain type of freedom."]},{"begin":"239.840","end":"285.200","lines":["So I think people don\u2019t really want freedom in the way they imagine they do or not as much as they think they do. And the way you can expand \u2014 and I think the self is fundamentally a limiting idea, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be expanded. You can expand it by engaging with more people with diverse perspectives because it turns out \u2014 and there\u2019s research on this \u2014 that we actually take other people\u2019s selves into our own. So if you think about your closest relationships, you can think about how much overlap is there between you and that person, right? And the closer the relationship, the more people will say there\u2019s overlap in who we are. And so you can expand the self by deepening the relationships you have."]},{"begin":"285.200","end":"314.760","lines":["I certainly know in my closest relationships with my wife, my kids, my close friends, that there is the taking on of other characteristics. I\u2019m curious \u2014 so in graduate school when I was studying relationships and communication within relationships, there was this notion that you and the person you\u2019re in a relationship with are your individual selves, but together you create a collective self. Is that something that resonates with your point of view, or is that something that\u2019s archaic and back from the good old days when I [laughs] was in school?"]},{"begin":"314.760","end":"347.720","lines":["Well, I guess what I would say is like I don\u2019t know what the individual self is in the way that\u2019s described. So I think people have this idea of I exist as an island and I bump into other islands, and then we can create something together. What I would say is you are, in some sense, an amalgamation, a combination, a mixture of all those relationships that, whenever you interact with someone, there\u2019s an exchange of self in some ways. So I can give you an example in terms of research.

So in some sense, your self is changing to accommodate other people because you want to have a relationship with them, that having a relationship with someone demands in some sense a shift in who you currently are. So in that way, there\u2019s an intermeshing of selves that happens at a level that you\u2019re not even aware of and probably aren\u2019t controlling."]},{"begin":"391.560","end":"398.840","lines":["And that is what\u2019s happening all the time in our lives as we navigate the world.

And in some cases, I\u2019m choosing to change it by choosing to engage with someone. Are there things I can do in the moment when I\u2019m in that situation, meeting somebody new or deepening a relationship that I have, that I can perhaps prepare myself better to expand that connection or relationship?"]},{"begin":"429.120","end":"433.800","lines":["Yeah.

And three, here\u2019s maybe one that will be a bit surprising to people: We often are afraid to ask what we consider personal questions because we think it\u2019s going to upset other people, right? We imagine if we ask this question, they\u2019re going to be like, well, who are you to ask me that question? Whether they say it or not, they\u2019ll be thinking that, and we want to avoid that discomfort. It turns out that research suggests that people actually are not put off by what most people think of as personal questions."]},{"begin":"466.960","end":"502.920","lines":["And so you can ask more intimate questions than you imagine. So I\u2019m not going to say go out and ask the most intimate question you can imagine. But I would say move towards asking more personal questions than you might imagine you could, just a step further. And that provides an opportunity to initiate a more meaningful interaction, even if it doesn\u2019t become a relationship. We don\u2019t take seriously enough some of the light interactions we have day to day, and those things turn out to affect us. Our mood is affected by the fleeting interactions we have that we don\u2019t take that seriously."]},{"begin":"502.920","end":"518.240","lines":["So another thing to do is, one, curiosity; two, be willing to ask questions that may be a little bit more \u2014 a step more personal than you typically would.

And underlying at least of the three bits of advice is communication. And you know that\u2019s something we focus a lot on here. Brian, I\u2019m really intrigued by this notion that we can benefit by probing a little deeper and getting a little more personal in conversations. I think you\u2019re right; many of us feel awkward and uncomfortable, especially if we\u2019re not really close to the people we\u2019re talking to. Do you have advice or guidance that you\u2019ve seen in your own life or you\u2019ve recommended to people about types of questions or ways to do that inquiry?"]},{"begin":"549.000","end":"555.440","lines":["I\u2019ll actually just say this is not my idea.

Where are you going to go? Have you been to this place? I think one question that is easy to ask people, that is not that personal but it takes you a little bit deeper is, what are you most excited about in life right now? I mean, there\u2019re just easy questions you can ask that no one would be, I think, bothered by. And then once they answer, it\u2019s like follow-up questions become much easier. You know, the way you form relationships is reciprocal escalating disclosure. And so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve talked about that, but if people haven\u2019t heard it, it\u2019s just like when someone says something to you, they disclose a little bit. And then when you reciprocate, you disclose a little bit more, and it escalates. That\u2019s the way that people basically form relationships."]},{"begin":"615.000","end":"640.840","lines":["So if you think about relationships in your life, that\u2019s often how they happen.

The final question, I\u2019m curious, how has your self changed in doing the work that you\u2019ve done in terms of writing the book, the podcast, the teaching that you do? It seems to me that, by your definition of self, it must have changed."]},{"begin":"661.320","end":"662.480","lines":["Oh, it has to [laughs]."]},{"begin":"662.480","end":"669.640","lines":["Right, right.

One thing that I \u2014 in writing a book, I became something else, right? And I still don\u2019t know what that something else. I\u2019m like a baby in this new self. And it generates an appreciation for what it means for the self to constantly evolve and change. I think we often don\u2019t really pay enough attention to the ways we change, and maybe we\u2019re harder on ourselves than we should be. Like I\u2019m brand-new at this thing, but it\u2019s not just this thing. It\u2019s, to some extent, who I am and how people are engaging with me and how I\u2019m engaging with them.

When people\u2019s identities are both challenged, their sense of self is challenged, and / or it shifts or grows, there\u2019s a recognition of when we engage with people, we are asking something of them. And I think I have a better appreciation for that, for the requests that my person makes of other people, right, of the ones that I make of other people and what that demands from others, and also when people do it to me, what it \u2014 it\u2019s an offer. I think of it as an opportunity and an offer that person is making to me, an offer of expansion.

And I think that\u2019s really interesting. And the other thing that caught my mind is there are certain situations in our lives where there\u2019s a gate that changes ourselves. Like you published a book. You are now an author. Your self has changed. And then there are other things that happen in our lives that are much more subtle that change us. I mean, those of us who have become parents, when your child is born, that\u2019s a change in self."]},{"begin":"800.440","end":"807.080","lines":["I recall back when I graduated college and even graduate school, it felt like this big change I was working for, and nothing really changed [laughs]."]},{"begin":"807.080","end":"807.960","lines":["[Laughs]"]},{"begin":"807.960","end":"827.280","lines":["It was I had this thing on the wall.
