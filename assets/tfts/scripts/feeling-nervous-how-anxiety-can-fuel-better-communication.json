I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am really excited today to chat with Kelly McGonigal. Kelly is a lecturer at Stanford GSB who teaches a class on presentation and communication skills for academics. She is also the bestselling author of \u201cThe Willpower Instinct: The Upside of Stress.\u201d And her latest book is \u201cThe Joy of Movement: How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Kelly. Thanks for being here. I am super excited to get time with you."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Oh, thank you for having me. I know we have a lot to talk about. I think we have a lot of common passions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. So, let\u2019s go ahead and get started. You have so many interesting and exciting areas that you look into and explore. I look forward to talking about all of them. But I\u2019d like to start where I first came to know you and your work, like millions of people, and I mean like 29 millions of people. I watched your TED Talk, \u201cHow to Make Stress Your Friend.\u201d We\u2019ve addressed the topic of anxiety management [in] communication several times on this podcast. And I\u2019m just curious to get your take on how we can manage anxiety and leverage the benefits that it has for our communication."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Oh, leverage the benefits of anxiety for communication. Okay, well, let me start by saying I\u2019m someone who was born anxious. So, I come to this sincerely and in a bit of desperation, right? It\u2019s not one of those people who\u2019s like, oh, I\u2019ve never been nervous and, therefore, I\u2019ll teach other people how not to be nervous. It\u2019s more I know what it\u2019s like to have a panic attack, so let\u2019s figure out how to stay engaged with life, even when anxiety is a part of your life."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And I\u2019d say, since you said the benefit of it, I think that, for me, what I have come to value about anxiety is it\u2019s a sign that I care."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So for example, when I start to feel anxious now, I will say to myself, my heart is in it, which is a kind of a mindset reset. You know, I can feel my heart pounding maybe, or I feel other stuff happening in my body. And saying my heart is in it is a way of embracing that one of the reasons I have anxiety is not because my nervous system is broken, or I\u2019m a person who just can\u2019t face life. I have anxiety in moments that matter where I recognize that something is at stake, and I want to contribute, or I want to do my best. I want to serve. I want to enjoy life."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"When you come to value that anxiety as a signal of meaning often or a signal of caring, then the benefit is in staying wholehearted, so that in that moment I don\u2019t have to say to myself, Kelly, if you don\u2019t calm down, you\u2019re going to blow it, or, Kelly, why are you anxious? What\u2019s wrong with you? I don\u2019t have to get into self-talk. I can instead double-down on the caring. I can think about who and what I care about, why this matters to me. Maybe I can imagine the best possible outcome. And then I can also use the energy that often comes with anxiety. I\u2019ve come to recognize anxiety as a physical state that actually really does serve me when I am in a role that I\u2019m meant to be in."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, for example, teaching. If I don\u2019t get anxious before I teach a class, I mean any class, a class I\u2019ve taught a thousand times before \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 if I\u2019m not feeling anxious right before it or even when I\u2019m walking over to teach it, there\u2019s something wrong. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m dissociated from the fact that this is what I was born to do, I\u2019ve prepared really hard for it, I really want to connect with my students. If I\u2019m not feeling that, something\u2019s off because I\u2019ve learned that I can actually trust myself to use that energy. I know that that energy, like my body is now a vehicle for it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And that comes in part from practice, a lot of practice, a lot of preparation, and then this developing self-trust."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like how you literally embody the notion of greeting your anxiety and the mantra that my heart\u2019s in it is so powerful because one of the first signs people report is their heart\u2019s pounding and it distracts them. But if you embrace that and say, hey, this means that I care about this, and it even extends to I care about the audience that I\u2019m in front of. And I hear you about getting nervous about something that\u2019s important and how it clues me into this is meaningful for me. And I also get nervous before I teach, and I now look for it, like you do. And if I didn\u2019t have it, I don\u2019t think I could \u2014"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"This [never] happens. Like once or twice I\u2019ve had a class where I was feeling kind of numb before \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 and man, that things did not go well."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right. It\u2019s either one I\u2019ve done before or something was distracting, and you miss that."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I wasn\u2019t there."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I wasn\u2019t present for it. And that\u2019s even another way to reframe it, that sometimes my anxiety is a sign of presence, which is so different from how people typically think of presence as being very calm. You know, I actually love the energy of anxiety when it\u2019s that right combination of adrenaline and endorphins and dopamine. We love this feeling. People do all sorts of things to try to get that chemical cocktail of adrenaline and dopamine and endorphins. By paying attention to my physiology and other activities I love, like working out \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 I realize it feels very physically similar. So, I just have to give myself a goal. Like anxiety\u2019s not as great in situations where I have nothing to do. I will be honest about that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs] Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"When it\u2019s worrying about the future and there\u2019s nothing I can do, where I\u2019m on an airplane and I clearly can\u2019t fly it [laughs] \u2014 like"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs] Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 like anxiety in those moments, I have other coping skills for."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"But since you asked specifically about speaking or that \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 kind of performance."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No, that\u2019s exactly right. And I think it\u2019s that reframing that these are the normal physiological symptoms that, in many cases, we seek out and enjoy. I think about first dates or exciting conversations. And we\u2019re doing the same thing, but we frame them as, hey, this is a great thing. I really like that. You and I both teach Communication Skills at the GSB. In fact, as part of the COVID emergency plan that was put in place here, you and I were backups for each other if one of us got really sick."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"This is a smart policy, by the way. I actually think that was pretty good that we got in the habit of doing that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"But yes, that was \u2014 that was a first."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, it reduced stress for me that I knew somebody as competent as you could step in, although I do have to admit I got a little nervous that my students would like you more than me [laughs] [unintelligible]. I\u2019m curious, what do you find are the most common mistakes you see our students and those you coach when it comes to communication?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yeah, so first of all, let me set the context. I work primarily with Ph.D. students who are all doing amazing research. So, they\u2019re used to communicating their research in academic settings. And my class is to help them communicate in every setting \u2014 professionally, at conferences, but also to the media and to potential collaborators and stakeholders and a random person on the street. And I would say that the thing that I say over and over again, and we do all of these exercises to try to practice it and yet is really hard for them, is to talk about crunchy details, not abstractions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, I don\u2019t want to know that you study the technological interface of emotions and artificial intelligence in market analysis of [blah] \u2014 like basically a string of nouns."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs] Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And I\u2019m waiting to like, okay, would you point to something that you actually study, like, for example, a dating app. Okay, great. And what problem are you trying to solve, how to get people better matches or something like that. And so, I\u2019m always saying like show me the actual thing. Show me the question you ask people in your study. Take a picture of people doing the thing that you study, even if what you\u2019re doing is modeling, and you never leave your computer. Go out into the world and take a picture of the thing that you\u2019re modeling so that I understand."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, I say that\u2019s the biggest thing we work on. And I talk about coming up with artifacts for you research \u2014 the photos, the videos, the audio samples, the objects that will help people understand what you do and using language that people will immediately understand. I think the other mistake is the mindset that a lot of academics have, in part because they\u2019re terrified \u2014 getting a Ph.D. is basically understanding that you don\u2019t know anything, and people are eager to point that out to you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, people get in this habit of feeling like they have to prove that they know stuff, hide that they don\u2019t know stuff, and also persuade you that their research is correct. So, a lot of times in research presentations or communications, my students will try to like talk fast and deliver things so fast you can barely keep up, so you can\u2019t interrupt with critiques. And I don\u2019t want to take questions because the questions might reveal what I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s this idea that like my job is to just sort of push my research at you \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm. Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 and get through it without there being any kind of critical dialogue. And what I always say is the purpose of any really interesting communication should be for the other person to have interesting thoughts in their own head about your work. It\u2019s not to convince them that your work is right or important or that you know everything about it. You want the person who is listening to you or watching you to think, wait, what if this \u2014 or I wonder if \u2014 or I don\u2019t think so, to the degree in which they are having their own interesting, spontaneous thoughts and questions. That\u2019s the measure of success."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"It really reframes like what you\u2019re doing and how you do it. Those are two things we spend a lot of time talking about."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. So, there\u2019s a lot there. I really like the goal is to have people have their own experience about your content. Absolutely. And not only does that invite collaboration rather than challenge and threat, but it also forces you, I think, to be audience centered."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My goal is to have you have an experience \u2014"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 rather than me just push all that information."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"That\u2019s \u2014 we do all that. I teach Empathic Design for Talks. What do they need to know? When do they need to know it? What do they need to see? What do they to like literally visually see? When do they need to be able to interrupt so that it really is from that point of view."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And it\u2019s not \u2014 this is not just for academics. Anybody is in that same position. I coach and teach executives and managers who feel like they don\u2019t want to be threatened and challenged. They just want to push out their decrees and move forward. It\u2019s the same thing."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"The thing I always tell them is, if there are problems with your work, people already know. And that\u2019s so funny, I\u2019ll see students \u2014 like they\u2019ll say something kind of interesting, and I\u2019ll be like, wait a minute; that was so fascinating. Like I\u2019m remembering that this woman in my class had mentioned that she calculated stuff with a certain 15-minute window during market trading. And it was very specific. And I was like that\u2019s so interesting. Why that 15-minute window? And tell me more about that. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I kind of rushed through that because I didn\u2019t want anyone to ask questions about it. I was afraid that maybe it was like the wrong choice.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! This is \u2014 that you made a choice \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 is interesting. And it almost is a matter of it\u2019s the perfect choice. I want to know that you made a choice. I want to hear why you made the choice. I want to be able to have an opinion about your choice."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that that particular example is really important and resonates nicely with some of the things we\u2019ve talked about when we\u2019ve talked with folks who are experts at improv. Make a choice, commit to the choice, be behind that choice, and be willing to accept what consequences come from that choice. And I don\u2019t want to lose what you said earlier about this notion of help people actually see what you\u2019re talking about."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That is so critical. It is so easy to hide behind slides and data. But if you can actually have people \u2014 help people have an experience of what you\u2019re talking about \u2014"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And it can be with data, too."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, I\u2019m always saying like, you know, if you\u2019ve got videos of babies doing funny things because you study infant cognition, show the baby videos. But also, if what you\u2019ve got is data or a model, you know, what people always do is they put it up there, and they\u2019re like, \u201cAs you can see, X and X.\u201d I\u2019m like, no."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs] Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"You don\u2019t say, as you can see. You walk me through it. What you\u2019re looking at here is this. Notice this. Like you zoom in, you interpret it. This dot, this slope, whatever this means this. As you can see, it\u2019s different from this. Like you want people to actually see it. So, it can be photos and videos, or it can be data. But the idea that somebody can understand something just because their eyes see it on a slide, that\u2019s so different from somebody having an actual understanding and an opinion about it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh absolutely. And it takes them outside of themselves and puts them in their audience\u2019s perspective. And I just want to get Meta for a second in and not Facebook. But you have done a great job in the answer to that question of doing exactly what you\u2019re talking about."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You help show us and give us an experience of it. You are an excellent communicator yourself, both in writing and speaking. I\u2019m wondering if you can share a bit about your process. What do you do as you\u2019re thinking about crafting your communication?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I always start with the best possible outcome for the audience that I care about most, right? So, you never control everyone who\u2019s in the room or everyone who reads the op-ed that you write or the book that you write. So, I\u2019m always thinking, well, whom am I really trying to speak to or reach, and what\u2019s the best possible outcome for them? Do I want them to feel a certain way? Do I want them to change their behavior in a certain way? And then I work backwards and I think, what do they need to hear? What do they need to do? What story could I tell that would make that outcome more likely?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And I\u2019m often like literally just writing this stuff down. I\u2019m writing that out. And I start to get ideas for content blocks. And this would be true if I were drafting a chapter for a book or giving a keynote. And I\u2019ll often think, well, what are these content blocks? Like what\u2019s the best story that I have? What\u2019s the best case study I have? What\u2019s the best scientific study I have? You know, I\u2019ve really learned to put things in judiciously, and that it only has to be one."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I only have to tell one story for an idea. I only have to share one study."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. So, to get back to the first part of what you said that I find so cool is you actually backward map. You start with \u2014"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Oh yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 what\u2019s the outcome, and what are the steps that I need to get there?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I do that for teaching, too, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh absolutely."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"That\u2019s how you design a class."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. We haven\u2019t talked about that before, but it\u2019s really interesting to start with what\u2019s the end, and then what do I need to add to it. And you are adding things very judiciously. Just one key example: You know, many of our listeners know that for decades I\u2019ve found great benefit from doing the martial arts. And I know you\u2019re a big believer in exercise and movement, not just in communication but in life in general. And your newest book, \u201cThe Joy of Movement,\u201d is a testament to that idea. I\u2019m curious if you could just share why exercise is so important, not just for health but for life. And I saw in \u201cThe New York Times\u201d that you\u2019ve got joy exercises. And I\u2019d like to hear a little bit about that. We all need a little more joy in our lives."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"People listening to the podcast couldn\u2019t see \u2014 I just did a joy move when you said that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Let\u2019s \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u2014 go backwards. Let\u2019s start with the joy workouts."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure, please."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, one of the things I tell my students is always start in the middle of the action."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Like start your talk with something interesting and specific."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So often people start with like these general, vague things \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, it\u2019s got to be like an action movie, I tell my students."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yeah. So okay. So let me \u2014 when I explain the joy workout, you will understand how I think about movement."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So \u201cThe New York Times\u201d called me up, and they were like, \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got all these seven-minute workouts that are based on getting your heart rate up or like using all your muscles in a specific way. And we were curious, would it be possible to create a workout specifically to make people happy?\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And I was like, \u201cWhy, yes.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"\u201cActually, I do it ten times a week.\u201d What they ended up doing was asking me to leverage the science of what we know about what joy looks like and feels like in the body, and can you teach people to move in those ways so that it actually makes them happier, more optimistic, feeling more connected, more celebratory. And it\u2019s based on this fascinating research that when people are in situations where they are dynamically happen, like you get good news, and just imagine what would you do when you get good news? People pump their fists, they throw their arms in the air, they jump up and down. What would you do if you saw someone that you love or you haven\u2019t seen in years? You fling your arms open wide. You like lift your face to the heavens. There are these gestures that people do."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Or even if you think about like an athlete who just did something amazing in a game, right? They pose, they show off, they do their happy dance."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, it turns out that these movements are really similar all over the world, in lots of different cultures. It seems to be a natural expression of joy. So, I developed this workout where you just like jump for joy and celebrate and sway and bounce, show people what it can look like, but you do it your own way. We put it to happy music designed to also make people feel better. And by the end of eight minutes, the idea is you can move your body in ways that get your heart rate up, that are good for your physically. But you did it not as like a punishment for what you ate, or not because you\u2019re afraid of some disease you might get in a decade."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Or giving a presentation."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yeah, or it\u2019s \u2014 but you do it because you can have a direct experience in movement that you value. And the research is really clear that people who are more physically active in an activity they enjoy, they\u2019re happier, they have better relationships, they have more meaning in life."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I would love for all of the people we work with to experience that joy in their communication, but also in just life in general. I find your approach to both mind and body, mindset and physical movements really empowering and so helpful. Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. I saw a big smile, everybody. If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I think this is going to be unusual, but my honest answer is trust that people are adequate to their experiences. That was eight."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll let you go. Help me understand what that means."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Trust that people are adequate to their experiences."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So this was something that I was taught by a Zen teacher, talking about how we show up for other people and how important it is, particularly when you\u2019re trying to help someone, that \u2014 to be present with them in a way that can hold the opposites of both you might be suffering right now, you might be overwhelmed, you might have health challenges, and whatever the situation is, and I want to help. And also, to have some kind of core belief that because you\u2019re human and because this is your reality, you\u2019re adequate to this moment."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"There\u2019s something in you that is adequate to the moment of your life. And this is something that it\u2019s a matter of trust or faith. It\u2019s a kind of a putting a trust in the audience as well that it\u2019s their life. It revolves around them. And I\u2019m just here in a moment of interaction. And often before I give a talk, I\u2019ll even think like, all right, I just hope that I say or do something that somebody here needed to here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s a lovely mantra as well. I found myself getting hung up on the word adequate because, to me, adequate means minimally acceptable. But in the way you\u2019re using it, it\u2019s very different. And it\u2019s an adequate in confidence."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"But nobody wants to be adequate. But I think what it is is it \u2014 what it\u2019s saying is people often desperately feel that they\u2019re not adequate to this moment. \u201cI\u2019m inadequate to this. I can\u2019t handle this. This is too much.\u201d And I know what that feels like. Like I have that voice in my head, too. So, there\u2019s something about \u2014 it\u2019s a kind of acceptance."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. And it also removes some of the pressure that I don\u2019t have to be great. Let me ask you the second question, and I\u2019ll be very curious to hear your answer. Who is a communicator that you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"So, this will be somebody that most people don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll try to describe her well enough that you appreciate her. Her name is Natalie Goldberg. So, Natalie Goldberg is an author and also a Zen teacher. And she has a really strong accent, like a deep, strong, powerful voice. And so she sounds very distinct. And then what she says when talks is like just absolute ruthless authenticity. This is how it is. This is my experience. The details. There\u2019s just something so grounded about it.

I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like the opposite of abstractions. And yet, she\u2019s so in touch with what it means to be human that everything that comes out of her teaching and her writing, I just feel like it reminds me of common humanity."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think a communicator that we admire who inspires us and challenges us to change or at least reflect on who we are is the right kind of communicator. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"I have an answer [laughs] that actually has three parts that I didn\u2019t even have to make up for this."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"This is something also that I teach in my Communication class and also when I coach people giving TED Talks. This is an idea that I learned from Gail Larsen, who teaches a speaking style that I really admire. It\u2019s really about like viewing speaking as an opportunity to change people\u2019s lives. And she says that there are three sort of sides of yourself that you can show in any talk. One is the face of wonder, which is really \u2014 it\u2019s curiosity. It\u2019s open-mindedness. It\u2019s what you wonder about. It\u2019s what motivates you. The second is the face of creative fire. And it\u2019s what you\u2019re passionate about. It\u2019s your drive. It\u2019s all of your time and your energy made manifest in showing that you care."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"And then the third is my favorite, which I don\u2019t know how often I get to do it, but it\u2019s rude magnificence. And that is when you realize there\u2019s something that people need to hear that might be difficult, and you know it because of your lived experience or the wisdom that you have acquired through your own suffering and adversity, or because you\u2019ve been willing to look and think about something for a long time. Do you have an opportunity to say something that feels important and true that is \u2014 [yet] you\u2019re the one who can say it. You\u2019re the one in the room who has thought about this the most, or you have a unique life experience to share."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I would expect no less from a communication teacher to share three really powerful ingredients. So, the notion of curiosity, passion, and what I\u2019m going to call authentic wisdom. Well, Kelly, this has been a true joy and pleasure, for sure. I have always admired what you teach and how you teach it and the passion that you bring. And it\u2019s been a true pleasure to chat. And I am hoping that people take away that there\u2019s so much value into reflecting on our communication, on our physical wellbeing, and the joy that we can bring to others. So, thank you."},{"author":"Kelly McGonigal","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

What\u2019s wrong with you? I don\u2019t have to get into self-talk. I can instead double-down on the caring. I can think about who and what I care about, why this matters to me. Maybe I can imagine the best possible outcome. And then I can also use the energy that often comes with anxiety.
