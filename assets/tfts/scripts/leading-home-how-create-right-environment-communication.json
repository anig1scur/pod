Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast. I am really excited to speak with Jonathan Levav. Jonathan is the King Philanthropies Professor of Marketing at the GSB. He also directs GSB\u2019s Behavioral Lab. Jonathan\u2019s research is aimed at understanding consumers\u2019 judgments and choices by using tools from experimental psychology and behavioral economics. In particular, he studies the contextual factors that influence people\u2019s choices and judgments. Thanks for being here, Jonathan."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Thanks for having me, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. I want to start by talking about the impact of context on our decisions, action, and communication. A while back, you conducted research involving judges in their sentencing. Can you share what you found and what your results might mean for how people make decisions?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"When prisoners have completed two-thirds of their sentence, they\u2019re automatically eligible for parole. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re automatically paroled. It means they\u2019re eligible for parole. And basically, the way the setup was is the prisoners come in and they\u2019re dressed in this orange getup just like you see in the movies. Sometimes they have a lawyer, sometimes they don\u2019t. And the judge makes the decision whether or not to release them on parole."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And what we did is we took a look to see which prisoners were released. And what we found was that if you plotted on, let\u2019s say, imagine you have an XY plane. Right? Imagine a graph. So, on the X axis you have ordinal position. What does it mean, ordinal position? Are you first? Are you the second prisoner? Third, fourth, fifth and so on and so forth. So, we had that on one axis."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And on the other axis what we had is your probability of being released. Okay? So, for example, if you were first in the sequence, your chances of being released were 60 percent. And so, when we plotted that, we observed a really interesting EKG looking pattern where initially you were reasonably likely to be released around 60 percent, and that decreased. Sometimes it went up, sometimes it went down a little bit. But overall, the pattern was a decrease. And then we observed a jump, and then we observed the same pattern, and then we observed another jump. And what we noticed was that these jumps coincided with meal breaks that the judges took."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, we have an interpretation. We didn\u2019t test the interpretation, but it\u2019s consistent with it. And the idea is that as people make lots of decisions, the previous decisions have an effect on the subsequent decisions."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And we\u2019ve all experienced this when we make a lot of decisions. Like in a meeting you have a lot of decisions. Your energy that you have for the first one is very different than the energy that you have for the third one or the fifth one or the tenth one."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, as you become depleted, let\u2019s say, the way you solve that problem is you simplify the decision for yourself. And so, what\u2019s the simplest decision? So Matt, you came up. You\u2019re like six or seventh on my list. I\u2019ve seen five or six or seven other bad guys before you. You know what? Easiest thing to do is just to leave you in prison. And so, that\u2019s what we observed. And then when people took a break, there\u2019s some kind of mental replenishment that looks like it\u2019s happening."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on what you think this might mean for people as they think about when they interact with others, it sounds to me like they have to think about the amount of decisions that they\u2019re asking people to make or that people might have made prior to the decisions we\u2019re asking people to make. What are your thoughts on that? How do we take this research and maybe apply it to make our communication more likely to succeed?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"I think the first step is the realization, and the realization is as follows: is that decisions and information is cumulative. And so, that accumulation can change how we approach the information. And so, as a result, that accumulation needs to be managed. Right?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Suppose I\u2019m communicating in a classroom, and I\u2019m saying a lot of stuff, and it\u2019s a lot of, lot of, lot of information. If I really want to be an effective teacher, I have moments during the course of the lecture where I change pace. I have people do an exercise. I basically give them the opportunities for those kind of mental respites so that they can then go back to then hearing me lecture, and they\u2019re not basically fried as they\u2019re hearing me do it. And similarly with decisions. When you\u2019re in a situation when you\u2019re planning multiple decisions, it\u2019s actually a process that you have to plan out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"The problem is, is that, yes, things will change, but we don\u2019t always know in what way."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"But what I can say with confidence is that something changes. And we also have some other research that shows that giving people a chance for a mental reset makes your message and makes their ability to approach information, it replenishes it and you\u2019ll be much more effective."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So many things to take away from what you just said. We\u2019ve talked often here about knowing your audience and really trying to understand what they need to hear from you. But you also have to think about just the psychological burden that is on your audience and address that."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s not just what they need to hear from you; it\u2019s how they need to hear it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And how they need to hear it is not a straight line."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"It\u2019s a dynamic process. And they need to hear it one way for a while, and then they need to hear a different way. And that different way needs to reinforce that one way. And then they have to go back to some other way. Otherwise, you\u2019re not accounting for your audience. You\u2019re not actually knowing your audience."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right, in addressing to their needs in the moment. That\u2019s fascinating. That\u2019s fascinating. I\u2019m going to apply that not only in my teaching but in my other communication, especially with my kids. I definitely have to say things in a different way in different timings, for sure."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Especially if they\u2019re teenagers."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"They are. They are, believe me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As someone who studies marketing and decision making, what suggestions do you have for those of us who want our ideas to get noticed? What can we do?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"I\u2019ll share with you two basic principles in decision making. The first one is that assessments of value are comparative. When I ask you how much is your iPhone worth to you, you don\u2019t go to the back of your mind and do a calculation and you come out with a number. \u201cIt\u2019s worth $1,700.25.\u201d No, you say, \u201cWell, compared to what?\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, really everything is comparative. If I ask you, \u201cMatt, how happy are you with your net worth?\u201d you\u2019re going to answer the question, \u201cIt depends on who you think about.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Maybe you grew up poor and now you\u2019re wealthier, and so maybe you\u2019ll feel great about it. But maybe you had an ambition for yourself that you would be a trillionaire now, and you\u2019re not there so you feel poor. So, the first thing is, is to realize that when people make a decision, when they evaluate you, that evaluation is inherently comparative. And your homework is to figure out what are people comparing you to. They\u2019re going to make that comparison whether you like it or not, whether you try to control it or not. Right?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, first of all, let\u2019s figure out what they\u2019re trying to compare us to. And the second thing is, let\u2019s try to induce a comparison that favors us. And you have control over that. We do that in marketing all the time with positioning. Right? We position a product in a way that it\u2019s differentiated relative to the competition so the advantage becomes apparent. So, that\u2019s one thing. That\u2019s one basic principle. The other basic principle is simplicity. Our minds are extremely capable, but also extremely cheap."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"What do you mean by that?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"By cheap I mean we want to make a decision or a judgment investing the least amount of mental capacity possible."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And as a result, when we look at a situation, the first thing we look for are what I call better than cues. In other words, I want to be able to see that an option is \u201cbetter than\u201d on some dimension than another option. And so, in your communication, in your offering [of a] product, a service, I don\u2019t know, a menu of whatever it is, you want to highlight those \u201cbetter than\u201d cues, because that\u2019s where we go to first. And the reason we go there first is because that makes it easy. Hey, this is better than that. Done. I\u2019m going home."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. I like both of those. I just had an assignment in a class where people do a panel presentation. So, there are four people presenting next to each other. And we talked about how that comparison you have on a panel is very different than other types of communication because you literally see the person right next to you, and your audience makes those comparisons. So, how do you want to come off relative to the person sitting to your left or to your right? So, that\u2019s really interesting."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"On a panel like that, unless you\u2019re clearly superior than everybody else along some dimension, the best thing to do is to come off as different as possible so you\u2019re not easy to compare."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, interesting. Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Because otherwise you\u2019re vulnerable to downward comparisons. But if you\u2019re \u201cI\u2019m the incomparable Matt Abrahams,\u201d I can\u2019t compare you. Okay, so he\u2019s a different beast. I\u2019ll judge you along different dimensions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I have been accused of being very different in many ways. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s always been positive. But this notion of better than I like a lot, because as we differentiate our ideas, our messages, our products and services, we can really position it as \u201cbetter than.\u201d So, it makes it easier for the audience to make that decision."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Just one thing: careful and being overly overt. It\u2019s like when you go to a restaurant and you ask the waiter what\u2019s the best wine, and they say, \u201cThis one, and it\u2019s the most expensive wine on the list.\u201d And you\u2019re like, oh, okay, they\u2019re just trying to sell me the most expensive wine."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"But people have what\u2019s called persuasion knowledge."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So yeah, you want to have those better than cues, but you don\u2019t want to have those better than cues in such a way that will raise suspicion that you\u2019re trying to convince people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. We talked about that a bit when Zach Tormala was here about persuasion and how you want to be persuasive. But if it looks like you\u2019re being persuasive it works against you."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Exactly. You got to look like you\u2019re not trying too hard in all things in life."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Exactly. You ran an online course here at Stanford for the School of Engineering entitled Leading from Home. The topics covered in your class are super relevant to everybody who\u2019s listening in. Without taking away from any of your potential students \u2014 wouldn\u2019t want to do that \u2014 I\u2019d like to have you share some of the things you teach in two topic areas. First, can you tell us how do you lead when your office is just a 13-inch screen?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"It\u2019s a great question. And to be honest with you, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re in the process of figuring out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yes, working from home was growing. It was up to about 5 percent of the workforce in 2018. But now I think it\u2019s going to end up being 25, 30 or 40 percent. And we\u2019re trying to figure that out. So, what we teach in that course is we say let\u2019s think about basic elements of the psychology of the workplace, how they play out face to face and how they might be different when your world is basically reduced to a 13-inch screen."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, I\u2019ll give you an example, like norms. When I go to the office, in a face-to-face office, there\u2019s all kinds of implicit and explicit norms. Right? So, you have the explicit norms are communicated when you have employee onboarding or when your boss talks to you or when your colleagues talk to you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s where you learn what you\u2019re supposed to do and how to do it, right?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Exactly right. But then there\u2019s implicit norms, like what time do people get in here in the morning. Okay? Or what\u2019s okay to wear? Or what kind of language is it okay to use? Like can you curse? Throw an F-word from time to time, does that make you seem cooler or does that make you seem more like not cooler?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I was wondering what you were going to say there."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah. I have to be careful. I don\u2019t know the norms here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This is a G rated podcast, Jonathan."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know the norms here, so I stopped myself."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, the hardest thing is to figure out now when everybody\u2019s remote or distributed teams and everything is through a 13-inch office is what are the norms. And so, one of the things that we teach is the first thing you have to do is you have to catalog what are the norms that you have in the face-to-face world and what\u2019s the purpose of those norms."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, let\u2019s say we have a norm that we shake hands. Okay? So, that norm, what\u2019s the purpose of it? It\u2019s to be able to say I \u2014 connection."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"I have a connection. I\u2019m here. And there\u2019s nothing that says connected more than physical contact."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Okay? But at the same time, we\u2019re connected, but we\u2019re professional. Because if I hugged you, we\u2019re connected. But we better\u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Might not be appropriate."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"It might not be appropriate in some environments. And so, the question is [so you\u2019re like], okay, I have norms to be able to create connectedness with people. Okay, so now let\u2019s think about a 13-inch office. What are ways in this environment in which I can create connectedness? And you\u2019re going to end up doing this deliberately initially until it becomes second hand. I\u2019ll give you a very simple example. Maybe I use a handshake emoji."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Right? Which is, I know, it\u2019s kind of a lame example, but it\u2019s giving you the sense\u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But it\u2019s fulfilling the same obligation."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Exactly, fulfill the same obligation. So it\u2019s like, oh. Or maybe it\u2019s not a handshake emoji. Maybe it\u2019s a different kind of emoji that suggests contact like a hand up that\u2019s like a certain kind of wave or something like that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, what we do is we catalog those types of things. So, norms is one of them. Things like nonverbal cues."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"When you and I are sitting together in a room, there\u2019s a bunch of \u2014 Like you just nodded."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I did."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Okay, so you nodded. So, that suggests to me, hey, I hear you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"But when we\u2019re doing things through a screen or we\u2019re doing things, imagine for example, just with voice, I don\u2019t see the nods. I don\u2019t have that nonverbal cue. Which means that I as a communicator, as a leader, have to find other ways to show that I\u2019m engaged. So, I\u2019ll say, \u201cUh-huh.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Right? Maybe I don\u2019t naturally say uh-huh. But now I\u2019ve indicated to you though this other modality the equivalent of a nod."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, we go through a catalog of that stuff and encourage people to join. I think it\u2019s one of the most interesting problems and it speaks to the future of work."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. Another topic from your course that piqued my curiosity was how do you maintain a company culture when some or all of the employees are remote?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Short answer, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s not just maintain a company culture; you have to establish a company culture."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right, yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Right? So here, culture is established partly through norms and partly through symbols and partly through rituals. Okay? And so, why do we have cultures? Well, what\u2019s culture? Culture is a set of shared meanings that allow us to be able to connect with each other, shared meanings combined with norms. And so, I would say for culture the same kind of things. First you have yourself, wait a second, what\u2019s the culture we have and what\u2019s the culture we want to have? And then with a bunch of trial and error, actually, say, okay, if I wanted to fulfill \u2014 [Say] I want to have a culture that\u2019s innovative. Okay? So, if I wanted to fulfill in some like \u2014 I say to myself, okay, I want to have an innovative culture. Now I\u2019m far away. How do I create environments for people to have those serendipitous conversations where they come up with new ideas? Some people do things like before a meeting, the first five minutes are meant for just silly serendipitous conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Another thing, you say, okay, there\u2019s research that suggests that when people go out and take a walk, they\u2019re more creative. So, maybe you actually encourage employees to do voice conversations while walking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"While walking, right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Right? Because when you\u2019re moving around, you may be physically inspired by things around you. But it\u2019s a deliberate process."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah, when you do those walking talks, it\u2019s hard because sometimes people are really panting and sweating as they go."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"It presumes being in shape."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. This notion of norms, symbols, and rituals, cataloging them and then thinking very deliberately about what you want I think is so important. I know you recently delivered a lecture on the top 12 lessons you\u2019ve learned about communication from your many years in the classroom. I would love to have you share 2 or 3 of those lessons with us."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, here\u2019s the ones that I tend to repeat a lot."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"You have to earn the right to bullshit."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay. I said it was G rated. All right. We\u2019ll bleep that. All right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"What that means is that first a story has to have a core, and then it has to have the refinements. And that\u2019s true in any kind of presentation or even any kind of writing. A lot of times you see people, they try to use this fancy language. But they use fancy language on vapid ideas. First let\u2019s get the sentences clearly put together, and then let\u2019s add the flair."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Too many people think that we start with flair, and if you have flair it\u2019s more attractive. It\u2019s not."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. It\u2019s style over substance versus substance over style."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Exactly right. First thing, you have to earn the right to \u201cbullpoop.\u201d And so, that\u2019s one thing that I quote a lot. The other thing that I quote a lot is actually something that was taught to me when I first became an academic. I was at Columbia Business School. And our dean of the MBA program, talking about teaching, said, \u201cRemember they\u2019re hearing it for the first time.\u201d Which I think is an absolutely brilliant nugget."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I agree."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And it\u2019s true in any kind of communication whether it\u2019s we\u2019re talking, whether it\u2019s we\u2019re in a room talking to lots of people, whether you have a product. The product essentially is a form of communication between you and your potential customer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And you have to take the perspective of \u201cthis is a person who\u2019s hearing it for the first time.\u201d And it\u2019s very hard to do because there\u2019s such an asymmetry between what we know. I know everything and you know nothing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And I have to feel like someone who doesn\u2019t know anything, and that\u2019s so, so, so profoundly difficult. That was the second thing. And let me add a third thing that relates to the current zeitgeist, which is you can\u2019t satisfy everybody, but you have to be mindful of everybody. Especially if you have a style, you\u2019re not going to hit the mark with everybody. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t be mindful of their needs. And needs nowadays are broadly defined around not just knowledge, but also identity and stuff like that. And sure, you don\u2019t have [to be] perfect for them, but you have to be mindful of them. And that\u2019s critical, I think, to be able to create the environment in which communication is effective."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The last point you brought up reminds me of a lesson I\u2019ve shared with many people I\u2019ve mentored when I was in the working world and I was running organizations."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"You\u2019re still in the working world at Stanford, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s true. Okay. When I was in the corporate world, one of the biggest lessons it was hard for me to learn that I\u2019ve tried to pass on to others is there\u2019s a difference between being liked and being respected."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And a lot of people want to be liked, and they\u2019ll do things that try to accommodate everybody, when in fact that ends up working against you. And it gets to that very same point you just made. Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. You up for that?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Go for it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. Question number one: if you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five-to seven-word presentation slide title, what would that title be?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"I shared it with you already: remember they\u2019re hearing it for the first time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes. Yes. So, so important."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I first came across that when I was an undergrad. I was studying Zen Buddhism and this notion of beginner\u2019s mind. And you really have to just put yourself in that perspective not just for yourself to learn and appreciate, but to really help others. So, it\u2019s about empathy and about really seeing it for the first time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let me ask question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"I\u2019ve been around a lot of great communicators. But I think the best one I ever saw is a guy who was a colleague of mine at Columbia who\u2019s now at HBS. His name is Sunil Gupta. Sunil Gupta was all content, clarity crystal clear, slick without looking slick. It was almost like Teflon, but at the same time it was mesmerizing. He could explain things in such a clear way. He didn\u2019t make a show. He didn\u2019t pace around. He didn\u2019t do all that bullpoop."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Right? He had earned it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"He didn\u2019t need it. And so, in that sense he was just absolutely brilliant. The guy would just stand in place and communicate."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let me ask our final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"The first three ingredients. Wow, that\u2019s an interesting question. I think first one is \u2014 Well, given that there\u2019s content?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Okay. So, the first one is clarity. Okay? And it has to be clarity to the speaker before it\u2019s clarity to the listener."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, I like that clarification."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And so, yeah, exactly. And so, too many people \u2014 You have to be able to say it in the middle of the night when woken up suddenly when someone throws a glass of water on you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Does that happen to you a lot?"},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Of course. All the time. But I have teenagers."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. Right, right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"But if you\u2019re not there, your listener will never get there."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, I think that\u2019s the first tip. The second tip that I think is critical is the best communicators are the best at transitioning from concept to concept."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, that is so cool. That is so important, and so underserved. People don\u2019t think about it."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"They don\u2019t think about it. They think in this world of slides. And so, they complete the slide. And they go to the next slide and they say, \u201cSo.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes. So or next."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Exactly, next. So is not a transition."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Okay? So is I\u2019m lazy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"So, that\u2019s the second part is moving from idea to idea. So \u2014 Every time you say so, I think about it. I have to now think of the third one. I think that the third one is rapport."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That connection."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah. This happened to me with my son once. We were in the airport. And I went to an agent and I said \u2014 First thing I always do when I\u2019m [negotiating a] public place where you have people serving you is I look at their nametag. And I said [something] that was like, \u201cMatt, what time is this flight leaving?\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And I could\u2019ve just said what time is this flight leaving?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"But the service I got when I said \u201cMatt, what time is the flight leaving\u201d was different, because Matt now was addressed by name."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And actually in that specific situation we ended up getting an upgrade from New York to San Francisco. And I remember my son, we walk away and we\u2019re walking onto the plane, and he says, \u201cDo you know that person?\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know that person, but they have a name.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And you know what? Name in communication is like sugar."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"And you get more with sugar. You get more understanding, you get more connection, you get more everything."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So, you taught a lesson, a very important lesson, to your son about individuating people and respecting people, and you got a reward for it."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Yeah, a nice seat."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, thank you. And thank you for all that you\u2019ve shared."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"A pleasure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As we close, I have a joke for you, Jonathan. I hope you decide to go along, so here we go. Knock. Knock."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Who\u2019s there?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tank."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Tank who?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No, thank you."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Whew, Matt!"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I told you my jokes were bad."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"You weren\u2019t kidding."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"In all seriousness, Jonathan, thank you so much. Not only was it super fun to talk to you, it\u2019s been very insightful. Your suggestions and teaching about what makes for effective decision making in communication is really helpful. And I wish you well, and I hope everybody takes an opportunity to learn more about you and the stuff you do. Thank you so much."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Thanks very much, Matt. Appreciate it."},{"author":"Jonathan Levav","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, produced by Stanford GSB.

It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re automatically paroled. It means they\u2019re eligible for parole. And basically, the way the setup was is the prisoners come in and they\u2019re dressed in this orange getup just like you see in the movies. Sometimes they have a lawyer, sometimes they don\u2019t. And the judge makes the decision whether or not to release them on parole."]},{"begin":"110.000","end":"131.960","lines":["And what we did is we took a look to see which prisoners were released.

So, for example, if you were first in the sequence, your chances of being released were 60 percent.

Sometimes it went up, sometimes it went down a little bit. But overall, the pattern was a decrease.
