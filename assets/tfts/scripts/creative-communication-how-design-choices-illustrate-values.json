  "intro": [
    "As a designer, Scott Doorley is interested in how humans create the world around them. It's a conversation, he says, that starts with the question: What kind of world do we want?",
    "Doorley is the academic and creative director of the Stanford d.school and co-author of the book, Assembling Tomorrow: A Guide to Designing a Thriving Future. In designing everything from a device to an app to a building, \u201cPeople get excited about what it can do,\u201d he says, \u201cbut what should it do? What do we want? What's the desirable outcome that we want in the world?\u201d"

      "text": "Excellent. You do design work and you teach design. Can you share with us what types of things you, your students, and those you work with do in doing design?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "[00:01:17]: Yeah, we think of design very broadly. It\u2019s really the act of bringing an idea into the world with intention. We have a degree program where we teach design students to be professional designers. But we also work with departments around the university. So the Graduate School of Business, the Graduate School of Education, School of Engineering, and on and on. And what we do is we have students come in and they\u2019ll work on projects that fit their expertise and their interest, which is usually a problem in a space they\u2019re interested in."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So we\u2019ll have students do anything from creating something that looks like design, a product. We had a grad student create a musical instrument that teaches you how to play music, which is very cool. But then we have students working on really large-scale systems. So also recently in the past few years, we had students working on healthcare in India, where family members took an active role in post operative patient care, which doesn\u2019t look like a product at all. That really is a system, a service, a way of doing things. And we call all that design."

      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "[00:02:16]: And those things are fascinating. I love the idea of a musical instrument that teaches you how to play music, that\u2019s fascinating. The things that you produce are the result of a design process. Can you share a little bit about what that process is like?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "Absolutely. There are very many different ways to look at it. And for us, it\u2019s always evolving. But the thing that I think there are two things that are fundamental about it. One is that design is specifically about desirability, right? So business is a lot about viability, engineering is about feasibility, design\u2019s about desirability. And there\u2019s ways to think about that. So one is to say like, well, it should be usable and maybe aesthetically pleasing. That\u2019s kind of like an old way to think about it, but it\u2019s also super pertinent. Another way to think about it is, is this something we want in the world? Is this desirable?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "And so that brings up the other part, which is how do you understand what should exist in the world? And the only way to do that is to get it outside of yourself. So most of the techniques that we use are about embodying work in the world. So that might be looking at how people use things presently, talking to people who are struggling with an issue. Creating something, which we call prototype, to test out and see if it works, if your assumptions are right, where you have breakdowns and then getting feedback about everything you do. So it\u2019s very much a process of externalizing your work so you can understand it better."
    },
    {
      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "[00:03:32]: I love that idea of desirability as compared to viability and feasibility. What role does communication play in all of this, and do you ever design messages using the same process?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So much. But I think it\u2019s probably true for everything, is that most issues, say you have on a team or you\u2019re trying to get something out there, communication issues, especially in design. Because design is so much about how people use things, how people understand things, what they make of them and all that\u2019s communication."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So, you know, if you\u2019re trying to sell a product, obviously that\u2019s communication. If you\u2019re trying to collaborate or lead a team, obviously that\u2019s communication. But I work specifically on interiors for workspaces and schools. And even that, the things we make in the space that we build into the space are communication."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So at the d.school, most of our furniture is movable because we want people to think about how they\u2019re setting up their space. We spent extra money on bright red casters, you know, the wheels that go on the bottom of the tables so that people would notice that they\u2019re movable. I\u2019ve done some work around here for different companies and we had, we were working on a leadership training centre. And one of the big things is they wanted everyone to be present when they came in."

Inside the locker is a plug so you can charge it. You watch everybody else doing the same thing, so there\u2019s a little social pressure to do it. And then you go inside and nobody has their devices. And that\u2019s really communication. You know, it\u2019s a ritual. It\u2019s a signal, it\u2019s a habit where I can see what you\u2019re doing, you can see what I\u2019m doing."

      "text": "[00:05:27]: It\u2019s the most obvious thing and yet the least obvious thing. It\u2019s to not manipulate it, right? Most people just walk into a room and they just accept what\u2019s there. We specifically in our studios, which are classrooms, we call them studios because they involve both teaching and work."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "In those studios, we make sure that the studio is not set up when the teacher walks in to start class. So there\u2019s no choice but to set up the space. And when you have no choice to set up the space then you have to decide what you want. And so we\u2019ve built it in that you have to manipulate the space to use it. And it\u2019s really powerful. One different arrangement can change the way people interact a lot."

    {
      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "[00:06:04]: Absolutely. I think this notion that all of us should take from what you\u2019ve just said is we need to be strategic. Not just about the messaging and the work that happens in the space, but how we actually set up the space."
    },
    {
      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "I have a colleague and friend who got so frustrated with everybody being on their laptops in meetings that he actually designed in a meeting room, a table that had an angle to it. So you couldn\u2019t actually put a laptop without it sliding off. And instead, he had magnets where you could put paper so you could write if you needed to capture notes. But the idea of manipulating the space to facilitate the interaction, I think is fascinating."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "I love that one too, because people will use anything for the thing they want it to be used for. If I have a table, I might use it as a chair \u2018cause I want to sit down."

      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "[00:06:47]: And it\u2019s sending a message that I want you to be present and it\u2019s about the interaction. I really am fascinated by that. In your new book, you and Carissa refer to runaway design. What is runaway design and how can we avoid it or just deal with it?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "Yeah, I think it is on the more deal with it side because I think it\u2019s here and it\u2019s probably here to stay. And what we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re just trying to point out that this moment right now that we\u2019re going through, which we can all feel, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "You just have to look at the news and you feel it in political unrest, climate change, machines that can think for us. It\u2019s all, you know, everybody has their list. That things are fundamentally changing in some way. We think it has to do with the fact that the materials that we\u2019re making with can actually change after we make them."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So it\u2019s very different than say, like, I build a car, while that might, you know, pollute the environment or make a pothole in the road, it itself doesn\u2019t change. Whereas even the algorithms that have been driving social media, those are based on machine learning, and so they can respond to the data that they\u2019re getting."

If we start getting into synthetic biology, which we call artificial evolution, it\u2019s like, you know, we\u2019re at, it can evolve, it can spread. And the people making with these tools are very aware of this, but it\u2019s a very different thing. So you can think about how that affects the people making it, but it also affects all of us. And I will say that the people working with it are often, and good for them, it\u2019s their job. They get very excited about the potential, what it can do. But there\u2019s a question of what should it do? Like, what should this stuff do? What do we want? What\u2019s the desirable outcome that we want in the world? And I think that\u2019s on all of us, right?"

      "text": "Yeah. And the idea of dealing with it, the reason I kind of said, yeah, I think it\u2019s more about dealing with it. Um, is that really, it\u2019s about like, how do we adjust to this? And I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re probably not going to get it right. So really we have to have systems and attitudes of being able to respond to it, not expect that everything\u2019s going to be perfect. And that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t advance. We should advance with the knowledge that we\u2019re going to have to adjust. And so I think as we move forward, we\u2019re going to trade confidence for curiosity a little bit. I think we\u2019re going to need to look and have leaders who are very curious about what\u2019s going on. What am I missing? What are we not doing right? How did that work? How should we change it? What do other people have to say?"

But there\u2019s this idea that if I express my curiosity, it might negatively impact people\u2019s confidence in my ability. We have this notion that leaders should be very focused and directive and curiosity sometimes can look very different than that. So I think that\u2019s a really interesting idea."

Can you share with us what you mean by actionables and intangibles and how we might be able to leverage that beyond the way you do?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "[00:10:05]: Yes, so the intangibles, and that\u2019s an idea that Carissa, my co-author, came up with, that framing, is something that designers do. They\u2019re looking for what\u2019s missing, what\u2019s unseen. That\u2019s kind of the initial act of design is to find what\u2019s hidden. And the way we think of actionables, they\u2019re the things that are very consequential that have a big impact on how we live, what we do, the way we feel. But are really hard to see. So there are things like the way our systems are so interconnected and even the feelings that we have inside of ourselves. But they\u2019re just these invisible things that have a huge impact."
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "The actionables then are ways to reveal those things. So I\u2019ll give an example. If you take feelings as an intangible or interconnection as an intangible. One actionable that we have, we call lose the object. And the idea there is that you go into any situation you\u2019re in and subtract all the technology and all this stuff, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Scott Doorley",
      "text": "So let\u2019s say take a mundane one, like a meeting, you know, subtract the tables, subtract the presentation, subtract the whiteboards. And then it opens you up to look at all the intangibles that are happening. So what are the connections people are making? You can see that through eye contact. Who\u2019s looking at who? Who\u2019s not being referred to? Who\u2019s having a side conversation? You can look at things like posture and that tells you about feelings. Like how does this person\u2019s posture express how they\u2019re feeling? Why are they feeling that way? So when you take away all the things we\u2019ve designed to create the world that we live in, you can start to see all the things that are hiding underneath it. Those are the intangibles, and the actionables are ways to see that."
    },

      "author": "Matt Abrahams",
      "text": "[00:11:39]: I really think this is an insightful way of looking at human interaction. I think if we look at what are the intangibles and leverage actionables to get beyond that, we can then see where we might need to actually do some work. We can be distracted by the things that we have built that get in our way of actually what might help us accomplish what we want to accomplish."

James Baldwin, who\u2019s a playwright and a poet, and he has this amazing quote that I love, which is the purpose of art is to lay bare the questions that have been hidden by the answers. It takes a second to get it all in there, right? Like it\u2019s so profound. But there are answers, there are solutions that we\u2019ve come up with, and those have cascaded over time. They\u2019re only one way of solving that thing, and often they\u2019re based on an issue that existed a while ago. You know, there are some issues that are just unique to humankind over time. There are others where there was kind of like a, well, we\u2019re going to solve it this way, that became a custom. And then we kind of just get caught up in the custom rather than the why behind it. So this ability to pull the why out of the how is really interesting."

I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I go into organizations because they need help with communication and I\u2019ll ask, why is it you do it this way? And the answer is because that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done it. And using this notion of intangibles and actionables, looking at that why and how really could be helpful.

So we knew we had to get ahead a little bit to really focus on how is this runaway design going to be shaping the world. But we didn\u2019t want to just speculate, you know, we didn\u2019t want to predict. We wanted to be able to say like, well, how\u2019s this going to affect our day to day? And then start to ask the questions, what happens after what happens? And stories are fantastic for that because they force you into details. A good story needs specifics. So the exercise of writing the story forces you into those specifics."

I would say for me anyway, they\u2019re a little more close to the structure of a joke than they are the structure of a novel, even though they kind of feel more like a novel, but a novel can meander. It kind of needs a lot of plot lines for you to get through it. It needs multiple characters. A short story really kind of needs a setup and a payoff the way a joke does, particularly short short ones. You know, we\u2019re writing some of them in two pages, three pages. And what I realized is how much the beginning and the ending relate, like how much a good beginning has to really set up the ending and how dependent the good ending is on whether or not you have a good beginning."

And so the beginning of the story really has to be the question that\u2019s going to set up the ending to answer in a slightly surprising way. Like something that feels satisfying and answers that question, but in a way that I couldn\u2019t have figured it out with the asking of the question. And so you basically have to go back and forth between the beginning and the ending, and sometimes the problem with the ending is a bad beginning."

And you\u2019re right a good communication, regardless story or not, is really about how the starting and the ending connect. It\u2019s about the promise and the purpose that you make and how you take the audience through that. I think all of us could benefit by thinking about our strategies and our tactics in terms of stories and really forcing ourselves or encouraging ourselves to think through it or even document it as a story. Because that forces you to think about things at a level, as you mentioned, that we probably don\u2019t."

So if you\u2019re interested in this topic, those are two great sources. But what they figured out or what they point to is the fact that feelings really motivate us.

I think our imagination, I think our emotions should be looked at in this age of runaway design, where everything is interconnected as a public resource."

They\u2019ll know that that\u2019s not a good tactic and it\u2019ll slow things down. So if you can\u2019t motivate yourself to do it for yourself, like monitor your feelings, do it for us, do it for everybody else, right? I think it\u2019s an important thing to do."

One of the things I respect so much about what you all do in the d.school and those of you who work on design, is the way you use analogies, metaphors, and comparisons to help you think. My favorite story, and I write about it in the book I wrote, is some hospital chain was looking to improve emergency room performance. And instead of going to other emergency rooms, they went to Formula One pit crews."

And he did it in such a way where it was very clear and not pulling punches. It was both direct and consumable, and there\u2019s something amazing about that. So I really admire people who can say what they mean in a way that other people can receive it. And I think that\u2019s a very hard thing to do."

But if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying, no one\u2019s going to know what you\u2019re saying. Francis Ford Coppola had this great thing when he was writing The Godfather, and he printed it as a book, all his notes. Every scene has something he calls the core."

So I think that\u2019s sort of capturing the essence. When we were talking about feedback, we talked, it\u2019s basically about trust, right? The thing about trust is if you don\u2019t have the trust, the communication\u2019s not going to land. So if you\u2019re not in a trusting space, you actually can\u2019t really communicate. So you actually have to back up. And get into that trusting space. And there\u2019s tons of ways to do that."

And so if you\u2019re trying to motivate people, which a lot of stories are about that, or a lot of presentations, a lot of our communication is about motivating. You really have to connect with people\u2019s feelings because that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to make a decision. They\u2019re going to do a logical thing because they\u2019re motivated emotionally to do it. So telling them the logical version isn\u2019t going to help, but you\u2019ve got to get into the feelings part of it."
