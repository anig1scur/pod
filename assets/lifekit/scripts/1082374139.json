And I would be like, where is your sequin dress? I would, like, bring a really, like, skimpy outfit and pretend that I was like, are you going to put it on? Come on. Let's go. That's not fun by your definition. But, like, bringing that sort of lightness to even a sort of difficult situation - I mean, a very difficult situation - you know, she would laugh and that kind of thing.

And often, a lot of the lowest hanging fruit is going to be the time we're currently spending on devices. And then the next step is to just get curious about your own curiosity. I started asking myself this question that I had been asking people when I researched \"How To Break Up With Your Phone.\" But I hadn't really asked myself. And that question was, what is something I say I want to do but I supposedly don't have time for?"

I have supposedly long wanted to learn to play it. So I ended up, with the next time I was online, signing up for this guitar class at this music studio here in Philadelphia. And it was BYOB. It was Wednesday nights. And it was just so interesting because as I went to this class, I started to feel the sense of energy. I mean, I start to sound extremely cheesy and, like, new-agey when I talk about this, but this..."

I was like, what is that? And also, you know, is it about this skill that we're learning? 'Cause I think another misperception we have about fun is that if we just stuffed more things into our schedules and we just try more things and have more activities, that's going to be fun. So to answer your question about how to get started, don't do that."

That's a really strong and powerful question. Like, I'm - you know, I'm trying to learn how to draw. I told myself at the beginning of the pandemic that I was going to try and learn how to play the guitar. I have not. But I..."

I think there's a mindset shift that has to happen where you just allow this curiosity that is inside all of us but that's been squelched down by adulthood, when you allow it to come out a little bit and to not immediately shut it down with your inner critic and that judgmental part of yourself that's like, why would you do that?

    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "So you might be wondering why I am talking about true fun as opposed to just fun. So the reason for that is because I realized that the fact that we don't have a good definition of fun means that we're really susceptible to anyone who wants to use the word fun to sell us on their product or their service or their activity, even if that thing does not result in playful, connected flow. So social media is one of the biggest examples of this..."

    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "...Right now. Like, it's marketed to us as a way - something to do in our leisure time that presumably must be fun, but it actually doesn't leave us feeling that we're in playful, connected flow. Instead, it often leaves us feeling depleted and demoralized (laughter)."
    },
    {
      "author": "FURLAN",
      "text": "Right."
    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "So I wanted to create a word for that type of activity that would distinguish it from true fun. So the most obvious choice seemed to be fake fun. So I use the fake fun to refer to any activity or product or, in some cases, people who aren't actually fun, who are presented to us as fun, but they're not fun. And the reason I think it's important to get into the details of parsing this out is that I think the better we're able to distinguish between sources of true fun and fake fun in our lives, the better we'll be able to allocate our limited leisure time. Once you're able to identify and call out fake fun for what it is, then it becomes much easier to clear out space for the good stuff, the true fun."
    },
    {
      "author": "FURLAN",
      "text": "Right. And also, like, you can try something that's like, quote-unquote, \"fun,\" and it's - for somebody else, they're having true fun and you are just like, this is not - I'm not feeling it. And you can go and try and learn something else. You know, like, you can find something that works better for you."
    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "Yeah. And I think if there's just an activity that you don't really like, I wouldn't say that that's fake fun, per se. I think of fake fun as being a little bit more nefarious than that, where it's something that's kind of slipped under your radar and presented itself as fun and it's not actually fun, so you're trying to kind of like swat it away (laughter) versus just something that you don't really like that's not - it's not doing it for you. Like, that's just good awareness to have."
    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "I'd also like to clarify the distinction between what I see as true fun activities and just things we enjoy. Like, we enjoy all the things that bring us true fun, but there's also things that might not result in full on playful, connected flow but that still are really enjoyable that we should still make time for - so reading books, for example, you know. So there's also plenty of activities we legitimately find nourishing or relaxing or enjoyable that might not result in full on true fun, but you really like doing them, and you should keep doing that. So if you love a particular show, watch it. Just don't watch it past the point where it goes from being enjoyable to making you feel gross."
    },
    {
      "author": "FURLAN",
      "text": "Or like - yeah, I think that - what one of the things that I saw as a distinction here that might be helpful to clarify is that, like, the connected part of true fun, which is that you're enjoying something and you're enjoying it with other people or with another person where you're connected to them."
    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "One of the pillars of what I call true fun is this feeling of connection. And I do think it's possible to have fun alone. There's plenty of people who have told me stories of having fun alone. So I think you can feel this sense of connection with the activity that you're doing. You can have this sense of connection with your physical body. But when I asked people around the world to share these stories of fun with me, most of them had another person or another creature involved. So I've got a whole list in my book of these fun factors, as I call them, and some of them are things like physicality - you know, some people love physical activities; other people, that's an anti-fun factor for them - music, nature, different size groups, like being in a small, intimate group, a bigger group. And I think it's kind of, if I may say, kind of fun to think about, to kind of break down your own experiences and figure out why because it just gives you more ideas."

    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "...But the idea of a fun audit, in my defense, is really an opportunity to kind of evaluate your present existence and figure out how much fun you are currently, or are currently not, having and try to hone in a bit more on so what are the situations in which you typically have the most fun? Because while we can't pin fun down and just say, I'm going to have fun, you know, that's ridiculous, fun is going to run away and just laugh for you, you can create a mood for fun. You can set the stage for fun. So this process..."

      "author": "FURLAN",

    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "The fundamental thing, if you will, that we get wrong about fun is the idea that fun is frivolous, when it is not frivolous at all. It can help connect us with other people, it helps connect us with our own lives, it helps us feel alive. So that's, you know, one of the biggest things we get wrong about fun, that it's frivolous, or that we don't deserve to have it, when in fact, it's enormously important and we do deserve to have it."
    },
    {
      "author": "PRICE",
      "text": "But I would say that in terms of one thing we get wrong about fun or that we don't think of when we think of fun that I found personally fascinating as a huge dork and science journalist is that it's good not just for our mental health but also for our physical health. And just to highlight two ways in which that's true, one is fun's effects on our feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is to say, it helps overcome feelings of loneliness and isolation, that we feel connected with other people and not alone when we're having fun. That's a really big deal because loneliness and isolation are enormously, hugely bad for our physical health. There is a study that actually concluded that the risks of loneliness and isolation could be comparable to those who are smoking 15 cigarettes a day (laughter)."

      "author": "PRICE",

Anything we can do that reduces our baseline stress levels is going to be good for us, physically. And fun is a very relaxed state. It's simultaneously energizing but also very rejuvenating. So I think it's just fascinating to think about fun as being a health intervention."

Be spontaneous, you know, jump into a pool with your clothes on, go roller skating in the middle of the night - gentle rebellion. That sense of stepping outside of your normal or expected role can be a really good way to find fun in your life. And the final letter in SPARK stands for keep at it, which, honestly, is pretty self-explanatory. And the more you do it, the more fun you might find appearing in your life."
