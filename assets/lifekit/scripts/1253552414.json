What next?","url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1253552414","intro":"Whether you saw it coming or were completely blindsided, getting laid off is one of the most stressful experiences in life. It can also be a huge hit to your mental health, making it even harder to focus on logistics. This episode, we lay out concrete next steps for the first day, week, month and onward after a layoff. That includes how to find health insurance, apply for unemployment and create a job search plan.","transcript":[{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"You're listening to LIFE KIT..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...From NPR."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Hey. It's Marielle. Today, we're talking about one of the more difficult things that can happen in your career - layoffs. So often our jobs are more than just a paycheck. They may be how we access health insurance, and for better or worse, they can be deeply connected to our identities as a person, how we see ourselves, who we spend time with. If you're at a job for long enough, you may have a lot of friends there, and then one day, suddenly, maybe unexpectedly, it all ends. Octavia Goredema is a career coach and author of the book \"Prep, Push, Pivot.\" She's worked with folks across industries at Fortune 500 companies, at startups, and she's had clients who've been laid off. If that's happened to you, here's the first thing Octavia wants you to know."},{"author":"OCTAVIA GOREDEMA","text":"Know that you are worthy. This has got nothing to do with your worth. This is a actual business problem, not a you problem. This is down to your employer not being able to sustain their current levels. It's not a reflection on you as an individual. This moment will not define you, and there's opportunity waiting for you. This could be the stepping stone towards something that could be exciting, invigorating, impactful. We don't know what's around the corner."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"On this episode of LIFE KIT, what to do when you get laid off. I talk to Octavia about the day of, the week of, and the months after, the paperwork you might be asked to sign, unemployment benefits, and how to get back into the job search and decide if you want to pivot to something else entirely."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Let's say you did get laid off. What is the first thing that someone should do that day?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Pause. That would be my advice. Losing a job is one of the most stressful experiences anyone can navigate. And even though it can happen to so many of us at some point in our career, when it happens to you, it stings. So my advice is, the first thing after you hear the news - is just give yourself time to process your emotions."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. What kinds of emotions tend to come up for people, you think?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Oh, my goodness, so many. Frustration, shock, fear, anger. Sometimes individuals have been preparing for the worst because there's perhaps been rumors of layoffs, but then when it finally happens, it just can still be a shock. Other times, people are completely surprised. They start their workday anticipating they're going to be going through their regular tasks and suddenly get an invitation to join a meeting that wasn't on their calendar before, and they're suddenly hearing news they weren't anticipating at all. So give yourself the space to feel how you feel, and don't isolate yourself if you are feeling upset or stressed or anxious or angry."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Is there anything that's timely in terms of - like, if you get laid off, I know some companies will be like, OK, get all your stuff and get out today."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yeah. And that's what makes it really hard because you're exactly right. There are time considerations that happen in the moment. So you'll be receiving a lot of information. You'll be receiving paperwork. If you're in your workplace, you'll have to vacate your workplace. And even if you're working remotely, you'll probably lose access almost immediately to your email or any files that you have. But that said, when it comes to paperwork, it's really important to ask clarifying questions such as, how much time do I have to review this? If you feel like you might need more time, ask for it. But don't feel you've got to rush to sign documents before you've had time to read through everything really carefully."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. So what are some of the types of paperwork that might come up?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Gosh, so it depends on the type of role you have and your tenure, but it's common that there'll be paperwork that relates to any vacation payout that you might have, benefits that might continue. It might be that you're asked to sign a non-compete paperwork. There could be a lot. And if anything isn't clear to you, ask the point of contact on the human resources team who has issued the paperwork to you to clarify anything for you because it's likely you might not have seen this type of paperwork before. And if you think you need a second opinion, make sure that you get a referral for an employment attorney. You can perhaps clarify any questions that could be impactful for you."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. When is it a good idea to consider consulting an attorney?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yeah. If you have any concerns about the nature of your departure. And I also realize in the moment when you're hearing that you're losing your job, and especially if you are being offered a severance package, you might feel, if I don't sign this quickly, I might not get that money. But it's also important to know that if you sign something, you are then bound by those terms. I've coached individuals who rushed to sign their paperwork and then found out that they could have negotiated a longer time frame, for example, to have healthcare benefits provided. And they were really frustrated when they heard that a co-worker who was laid off at the same time actually was able to do that, and they just hadn't thought about it."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"When I think about negotiation, I think, well, it happens when you have something the other party wants and they have something you want. But if they're laying you off, you might think, oh, well, I don't have anything that they want anymore. I'm not sure that's actually true, though."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Who knows? Maybe they would love for you to stay on for another couple weeks to wind the project down, and that's something you could offer in exchange for something you want."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes. And everyone's circumstances are different. Layoffs can sometimes be that the employer is actually hoping at some point (laughter) they could actually be able to invite employees back. It could be that an employer actually does need help winding down a project."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right. Takeaway 1 - if you get laid off, Octavia says the first thing to do is pause. Give yourself a moment to sit with your emotions. If your company presents you with paperwork, don't feel like you have to sign it immediately. Read through it carefully and ask questions or consult a lawyer if you want a second opinion. By the way, if you're in the private sector and you're not a manager, your employers are not allowed to make you sign a broad nondisclosure agreement as a condition for receiving severance. That's what the National Labor Relations Board decided in 2023. So if they do ask you to, look carefully, and this might be the time to involve a lawyer."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right, so let's zoom out to the first week. What's the plan for the first week?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"So first of all, filing for unemployment is something that's really important to do as quickly as possible if you've received severance and if you haven't received severance. Look at your state's requirements and start that process as quickly as possible. And then also just looking at your finances. Often, your timeline for finding your next role depends on what assets and resources you have, whether it's with regards to emergency savings or severance or other income, perhaps from your partner. And that will determine quite often how long you have before you have to find your next role."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. OK, I want to get into that, but let's talk a little bit more first about unemployment. How does it work?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Each state offers different amounts in terms of timeline. So most states offer up to 26 weeks, though some offer significantly less, like, for example, maybe 12 weeks. So it's really important for you to clarify, first of all, what your specific state offers. After you've submitted your paperwork, you'll typically receive those funds either via a direct deposit to a bank account or via a prepaid debit card."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And are there any other benefits that people might qualify for when they get laid off?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Often, people have a lot of questions about what they will do with regards to health care. Your employer will offer COBRA, which allows you to continue if you're on your employer's health insurance. But that can be really expensive. So you might want to explore other options, look at what the health insurance marketplace offers in your state, and there might also be short-term health plans that you consider, depending on your own specific needs."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. So in that first week after a layoff, I imagine you also want to start making a plan for your job search, right? How should people go about that?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"I encourage people to think about this in two ways. Think about the best-case scenario. So think about what you want to do next, and think about perhaps how long it took you to find the role that you were just laid off from. And think about, OK, if I add another month or two months to that, use that as a timeline, and then think about the worst-case scenario. What if it was to take you up to or beyond the timeline that you've budgeted for? What would you do if? And thinking through, what would I do if, starts to help you think about some contingency plans, such as stop-gap income, or how you could perhaps reduce your overheads in that time. So you start to think about if the worst happened from a timing perspective, what I would do. Then you can start to think about what the immediate next steps are that you can take for your best-case scenario."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway 2 - in the first week after your layoff, apply for unemployment benefits and think about your plan for health insurance. Then take a look at your finances and see what your timeline is. Come up with a financial plan for the worst-case scenario, if it takes you longer than expected to find a job. Is there another temporary job you could get in the meantime? Could you lower your spending or do some freelance work? Having a backup plan will give you some peace of mind as you're job hunting. Sometimes, if you are looking for a job, it can just feel so exhausting."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Right? It's like you're putting out so many resumes, you're having all these networking conversations. You know, you start to feel like there's something wrong with you. I remember a former coworker of mine saying it helped him when he remembered, I just need one of these."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes, I love that framing. And the job application and interview process is exhausting and stressful. That does not define you. And you know the amount of time that you've spent working on an application or the number of applications you've submitted. Your next employer doesn't know that. Right?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Right."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"They see you as the person they want."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. When you do get an interview for a new job, how can you talk about being laid off?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"You're not the first person to lose your job through a layoff. You won't be the last. And more than likely, the person asking you the question will have experienced that themselves, or will have had someone close to them who has been through that process. They'll get it. So the first thing to do is to just explain that your role was eliminated, perhaps due to declining revenue, or your company lost a major client. Reinforce something you're really proud of, of what you did in that role, and convey your enthusiasm for the role that's in front of you right now, what you're looking to do next, what excites you about that. There is no shame in losing your job through a layoff, and you should not feel that that holds you back in any way. If someone is asking you that question, they're asking you because you're there for an interview, because you're being considered for a role, and no one will have an interview with someone who couldn't do the job."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. It's really just a conversation to see if you're a good fit for each other."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Like, you don't want to come in as a supplicant saying, I - could you please give me this job? I need this. I - I'll do anything. You know, it's not the attitude. It's not the mindset to come in with."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Absolutely. Even though the interview process is determined by the employer, as you say, this is an opportunity for you to observe and listen. How does this align with what you want to do next and the environment that you want to commit to?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway 3 - as you interview for jobs, don't be afraid to mention the layoff. Your interviewer has likely been through one or knows someone who has. Talk about an accomplishment you were proud of at your last job and emphasize what you're excited about next. And remember, this interview is a conversation to see if you're a good fit for each other. You have skills and qualities they want. Be confident."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"I imagine that a lot of people will feel pressure to take any job, really, rather than wait for something that they're - they actually want or that's close to what they used to have."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Yes, that's not an uncommon feeling, especially if the sector that you work in is being impacted by layoffs more broadly. This is where your network can just be so valuable. Often, it's not just who you know, but who those people know. And that's why talking to people is such a compounding benefit. It also might open the door to opportunities that aren't advertised, especially for perhaps temporary roles or consulting roles that could help you while you're navigating your job search for a permanent role. And also know, if you have to take a stopgap opportunity, that won't define you forever. Five years from now, you'll actually look back on this time as an opportunity where you were able to really problem-solve and demonstrate resilience and broaden your network. You'll see it in a different perspective. But in the moment, if there are things that you have to do while you're building towards your next career step, there's no shame in that."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"When do you recommend that people consider taking a pay cut or a more junior position versus holding out?"},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"It depends really on that person's circumstances. There will always be certain nonnegotiables, and someone might actually need to have a role that offers health insurance, for example. Someone may not require that with their next opportunity. Someone may be able to look for opportunities in another part of the country. Someone may not. And then I think it's also really important to know that even if you perhaps are earning less than you were before, look at what that role, if it's being offered to you, could add value in other ways. What could you do with that role as a foundation? So it's all about your personal runway and then also thinking about what you would love to do next and what you know you definitely don't want to do next. I encourage people to make a list and to prioritize components on that list, and that list is unique to you. Often, compensation is important, but it could be the size of the company. It could be the type of the work that you're doing. It could be your proximity to home. There are so many variables, and your career belongs to you. You know, jobs will come and go. Bosses and co-workers will come and go. But your career is yours."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right. Takeaway four - make a list of your priorities in the job search and know that even if you have to take a temporary gig or a more junior-level job right now, those can still push your career forward. Also, it may not feel like this in the moment, but getting laid off gives you a blank slate, an opportunity to even try something different. Like, maybe you've always wanted to turn your woodworking hobby into a career. If there's something you're into or passionate about, this could be a good time. Octavia shared a story of one of her clients who went through multiple layoffs."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Every time that he was laid off, he did what he had to do, found another role, started that role. And then a couple of years later, the same thing would happen, and it happened multiple times. And eventually, he got to the point where he's like, I can't do this anymore, and he made a complete pivot. He left behind a career in graphic design and actually became a gardener, and he's so happy. He doesn't look back. And so it goes to show that in the moment, you don't know what comes next, but it's moving you in a direction that actually could be really valuable in the long term."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Octavia, thank you so much for this."},{"author":"GOREDEMA","text":"Oh, you are so welcome."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right. Time for a recap. Takeaway one - on Day 1 of a layoff, pause. Take a chance to read through any paperwork and understand your legal rights before signing. Ask your company HR rep any questions you have and reach out to a lawyer if you need to."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway two - apply for unemployment benefits as soon as possible. Then take a look at your finances and create an income plan for the best- and worst-case scenarios. The worst-case scenario is in case it takes you longer than you expect to get another job. You could take a temporary job, cut your spending, move to another place. Also, think about your best-case scenario - what you ideally want to do next."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway three - as you interview for jobs, highlight what you are proud of from your last role and what you're most excited about going forward. Don't be afraid to talk about getting laid off. They'll understand."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And takeaway four - make a list of the moments from your career or beyond that have really excited you. When have you felt the most fulfilled? Then list your priorities for your next step. It might not seem like it, but a layoff can be an opportunity to pivot or to dream even bigger."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

It's Marielle. Today, we're talking about one of the more difficult things that can happen in your career - layoffs. So often our jobs are more than just a paycheck. They may be how we access health insurance, and for better or worse, they can be deeply connected to our identities as a person, how we see ourselves, who we spend time with. If you're at a job for long enough, you may have a lot of friends there, and then one day, suddenly, maybe unexpectedly, it all ends. Octavia Goredema is a career coach and author of the book \"Prep, Push, Pivot.\" She's worked with folks across industries at Fortune 500 companies, at startups, and she's had clients who've been laid off. If that's happened to you, here's the first thing Octavia wants you to know."]},{"begin":"75.760","end":"116.520","lines":["Know that you are worthy. This has got nothing to do with your worth. This is a actual business problem, not a you problem. This is down to your employer not being able to sustain their current levels. It's not a reflection on you as an individual. This moment will not define you, and there's opportunity waiting for you. This could be the stepping stone towards something that could be exciting, invigorating, impactful. We don't know what's around the corner."]},{"begin":"116.520","end":"133.320","lines":["On this episode of LIFE KIT, what to do when you get laid off.

What is the first thing that someone should do that day?"]},{"begin":"149.240","end":"176.960","lines":["Pause. That would be my advice. Losing a job is one of the most stressful experiences anyone can navigate. And even though it can happen to so many of us at some point in our career, when it happens to you, it stings. So my advice is, the first thing after you hear the news - is just give yourself time to process your emotions."]},{"begin":"176.960","end":"185.560","lines":["Yeah. What kinds of emotions tend to come up for people, you think?"]},{"begin":"185.560","end":"252.080","lines":["Oh, my goodness, so many. Frustration, shock, fear, anger. Sometimes individuals have been preparing for the worst because there's perhaps been rumors of layoffs, but then when it finally happens, it just can still be a shock. Other times, people are completely surprised. They start their workday anticipating they're going to be going through their regular tasks and suddenly get an invitation to join a meeting that wasn't on their calendar before, and they're suddenly hearing news they weren't anticipating at all. So give yourself the space to feel how you feel, and don't isolate yourself if you are feeling upset or stressed or anxious or angry."]},{"begin":"252.080","end":"276.200","lines":["Is there anything that's timely in terms of - like, if you get laid off, I know some companies will be like, OK, get all your stuff and get out today."]},{"begin":"276.200","end":"352.800","lines":["Yeah. And that's what makes it really hard because you're exactly right. There are time considerations that happen in the moment. So you'll be receiving a lot of information. You'll be receiving paperwork. If you're in your workplace, you'll have to vacate your workplace. And even if you're working remotely, you'll probably lose access almost immediately to your email or any files that you have. But that said, when it comes to paperwork, it's really important to ask clarifying questions such as, how much time do I have to review this? If you feel like you might need more time, ask for it. But don't feel you've got to rush to sign documents before you've had time to read through everything really carefully."]},{"begin":"352.800","end":"357.360","lines":["Yeah.

It might be that you're asked to sign a non-compete paperwork. There could be a lot. And if anything isn't clear to you, ask the point of contact on the human resources team who has issued the paperwork to you to clarify anything for you because it's likely you might not have seen this type of paperwork before. And if you think you need a second opinion, make sure that you get a referral for an employment attorney. You can perhaps clarify any questions that could be impactful for you."]},{"begin":"413.960","end":"419.800","lines":["Yeah. When is it a good idea to consider consulting an attorney?"]},{"begin":"419.800","end":"480.240","lines":["Yeah. If you have any concerns about the nature of your departure. And I also realize in the moment when you're hearing that you're losing your job, and especially if you are being offered a severance package, you might feel, if I don't sign this quickly, I might not get that money. But it's also important to know that if you sign something, you are then bound by those terms. I've coached individuals who rushed to sign their paperwork and then found out that they could have negotiated a longer time frame, for example, to have healthcare benefits provided. And they were really frustrated when they heard that a co-worker who was laid off at the same time actually was able to do that, and they just hadn't thought about it."]},{"begin":"480.240","end":"502.400","lines":["When I think about negotiation, I think, well, it happens when you have something the other party wants and they have something you want. But if they're laying you off, you might think, oh, well, I don't have anything that they want anymore. I'm not sure that's actually true, though."]},{"begin":"502.400","end":"502.840","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"502.840","end":"515.240","lines":["Who knows? Maybe they would love for you to stay on for another couple weeks to wind the project down, and that's something you could offer in exchange for something you want."]},{"begin":"515.240","end":"531.280","lines":["Yes. And everyone's circumstances are different. Layoffs can sometimes be that the employer is actually hoping at some point (laughter) they could actually be able to invite employees back. It could be that an employer actually does need help winding down a project."]},{"begin":"531.280","end":"573.920","lines":["All right. Takeaway 1 - if you get laid off, Octavia says the first thing to do is pause. Give yourself a moment to sit with your emotions. If your company presents you with paperwork, don't feel like you have to sign it immediately. Read through it carefully and ask questions or consult a lawyer if you want a second opinion. By the way, if you're in the private sector and you're not a manager, your employers are not allowed to make you sign a broad nondisclosure agreement as a condition for receiving severance. That's what the National Labor Relations Board decided in 2023. So if they do ask you to, look carefully, and this might be the time to involve a lawyer."]},{"begin":"573.920","end":"583.440","lines":["All right, so let's zoom out to the first week. What's the plan for the first week?"]},{"begin":"583.440","end":"624.480","lines":["So first of all, filing for unemployment is something that's really important to do as quickly as possible if you've received severance and if you haven't received severance. Look at your state's requirements and start that process as quickly as possible. And then also just looking at your finances. Often, your timeline for finding your next role depends on what assets and resources you have, whether it's with regards to emergency savings or severance or other income, perhaps from your partner. And that will determine quite often how long you have before you have to find your next role."]},{"begin":"624.480","end":"632.320","lines":["Yeah. OK, I want to get into that, but let's talk a little bit more first about unemployment. How does it work?"]},{"begin":"632.320","end":"665.800","lines":["Each state offers different amounts in terms of timeline. So most states offer up to 26 weeks, though some offer significantly less, like, for example, maybe 12 weeks. So it's really important for you to clarify, first of all, what your specific state offers. After you've submitted your paperwork, you'll typically receive those funds either via a direct deposit to a bank account or via a prepaid debit card."]},{"begin":"665.800","end":"671.080","lines":["And are there any other benefits that people might qualify for when they get laid off?"]},{"begin":"671.080","end":"700.440","lines":["Often, people have a lot of questions about what they will do with regards to health care. Your employer will offer COBRA, which allows you to continue if you're on your employer's health insurance. But that can be really expensive. So you might want to explore other options, look at what the health insurance marketplace offers in your state, and there might also be short-term health plans that you consider, depending on your own specific needs."]},{"begin":"700.440","end":"710.040","lines":["OK. So in that first week after a layoff, I imagine you also want to start making a plan for your job search, right? How should people go about that?"]},{"begin":"710.040","end":"770.400","lines":["I encourage people to think about this in two ways. Think about the best-case scenario. So think about what you want to do next, and think about perhaps how long it took you to find the role that you were just laid off from. And think about, OK, if I add another month or two months to that, use that as a timeline, and then think about the worst-case scenario. What if it was to take you up to or beyond the timeline that you've budgeted for? What would you do if? And thinking through, what would I do if, starts to help you think about some contingency plans, such as stop-gap income, or how you could perhaps reduce your overheads in that time. So you start to think about if the worst happened from a timing perspective, what I would do. Then you can start to think about what the immediate next steps are that you can take for your best-case scenario."]},{"begin":"770.400","end":"803.760","lines":["Takeaway 2 - in the first week after your layoff, apply for unemployment benefits and think about your plan for health insurance. Then take a look at your finances and see what your timeline is. Come up with a financial plan for the worst-case scenario, if it takes you longer than expected to find a job. Is there another temporary job you could get in the meantime? Could you lower your spending or do some freelance work? Having a backup plan will give you some peace of mind as you're job hunting. Sometimes, if you are looking for a job, it can just feel so exhausting."]},{"begin":"803.760","end":"804.280","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"804.280","end":"821.920","lines":["Right? It's like you're putting out so many resumes, you're having all these networking conversations. You know, you start to feel like there's something wrong with you. I remember a former coworker of mine saying it helped him when he remembered, I just need one of these."]},{"begin":"821.920","end":"844.720","lines":["Yes, I love that framing. And the job application and interview process is exhausting and stressful. That does not define you. And you know the amount of time that you've spent working on an application or the number of applications you've submitted. Your next employer doesn't know that. Right?"]},{"begin":"844.720","end":"845.120","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"845.120","end":"847.520","lines":["They see you as the person they want."]},{"begin":"847.520","end":"855.760","lines":["Yeah. When you do get an interview for a new job, how can you talk about being laid off?"]},{"begin":"855.760","end":"913.640","lines":["You're not the first person to lose your job through a layoff. You won't be the last. And more than likely, the person asking you the question will have experienced that themselves, or will have had someone close to them who has been through that process. They'll get it. So the first thing to do is to just explain that your role was eliminated, perhaps due to declining revenue, or your company lost a major client. Reinforce something you're really proud of, of what you did in that role, and convey your enthusiasm for the role that's in front of you right now, what you're looking to do next, what excites you about that. There is no shame in losing your job through a layoff, and you should not feel that that holds you back in any way. If someone is asking you that question, they're asking you because you're there for an interview, because you're being considered for a role, and no one will have an interview with someone who couldn't do the job."]},{"begin":"913.640","end":"919.320","lines":["Yeah. It's really just a conversation to see if you're a good fit for each other."]},{"begin":"919.320","end":"919.880","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"919.880","end":"931.840","lines":["Like, you don't want to come in as a supplicant saying, I - could you please give me this job? I need this. I - I'll do anything. You know, it's not the attitude. It's not the mindset to come in with."]},{"begin":"931.840","end":"952.200","lines":["Absolutely. Even though the interview process is determined by the employer, as you say, this is an opportunity for you to observe and listen. How does this align with what you want to do next and the environment that you want to commit to?"]},{"begin":"952.200","end":"974.440","lines":["Takeaway 3 - as you interview for jobs, don't be afraid to mention the layoff. Your interviewer has likely been through one or knows someone who has. Talk about an accomplishment you were proud of at your last job and emphasize what you're excited about next. And remember, this interview is a conversation to see if you're a good fit for each other. You have skills and qualities they want. Be confident."]},{"begin":"974.440","end":"986.920","lines":["I imagine that a lot of people will feel pressure to take any job, really, rather than wait for something that they're - they actually want or that's close to what they used to have."]},{"begin":"986.920","end":"1051.520","lines":["Yes, that's not an uncommon feeling, especially if the sector that you work in is being impacted by layoffs more broadly. This is where your network can just be so valuable. Often, it's not just who you know, but who those people know. And that's why talking to people is such a compounding benefit. It also might open the door to opportunities that aren't advertised, especially for perhaps temporary roles or consulting roles that could help you while you're navigating your job search for a permanent role. And also know, if you have to take a stopgap opportunity, that won't define you forever. Five years from now, you'll actually look back on this time as an opportunity where you were able to really problem-solve and demonstrate resilience and broaden your network. You'll see it in a different perspective. But in the moment, if there are things that you have to do while you're building towards your next career step, there's no shame in that."]},{"begin":"1051.520","end":"1060.400","lines":["When do you recommend that people consider taking a pay cut or a more junior position versus holding out?"]},{"begin":"1060.400","end":"1134.880","lines":["It depends really on that person's circumstances. There will always be certain nonnegotiables, and someone might actually need to have a role that offers health insurance, for example. Someone may not require that with their next opportunity. Someone may be able to look for opportunities in another part of the country. Someone may not. And then I think it's also really important to know that even if you perhaps are earning less than you were before, look at what that role, if it's being offered to you, could add value in other ways. What could you do with that role as a foundation? So it's all about your personal runway and then also thinking about what you would love to do next and what you know you definitely don't want to do next. I encourage people to make a list and to prioritize components on that list, and that list is unique to you. Often, compensation is important, but it could be the size of the company. It could be the type of the work that you're doing. It could be your proximity to home. There are so many variables, and your career belongs to you. You know, jobs will come and go. Bosses and co-workers will come and go. But your career is yours."]},{"begin":"1134.880","end":"1173.440","lines":["All right. Takeaway four - make a list of your priorities in the job search and know that even if you have to take a temporary gig or a more junior-level job right now, those can still push your career forward. Also, it may not feel like this in the moment, but getting laid off gives you a blank slate, an opportunity to even try something different. Like, maybe you've always wanted to turn your woodworking hobby into a career. If there's something you're into or passionate about, this could be a good time. Octavia shared a story of one of her clients who went through multiple layoffs."]},{"begin":"1173.440","end":"1216.200","lines":["Every time that he was laid off, he did what he had to do, found another role, started that role. And then a couple of years later, the same thing would happen, and it happened multiple times. And eventually, he got to the point where he's like, I can't do this anymore, and he made a complete pivot. He left behind a career in graphic design and actually became a gardener, and he's so happy. He doesn't look back. And so it goes to show that in the moment, you don't know what comes next, but it's moving you in a direction that actually could be really valuable in the long term."]},{"begin":"1216.200","end":"1218.360","lines":["Octavia, thank you so much for this."]},{"begin":"1218.360","end":"1220.240","lines":["Oh, you are so welcome."]},{"begin":"1220.240","end":"1240.720","lines":["All right. Time for a recap. Takeaway one - on Day 1 of a layoff, pause. Take a chance to read through any paperwork and understand your legal rights before signing. Ask your company HR rep any questions you have and reach out to a lawyer if you need to."]},{"begin":"1240.720","end":"1263.360","lines":["Takeaway two - apply for unemployment benefits as soon as possible. Then take a look at your finances and create an income plan for the best- and worst-case scenarios. The worst-case scenario is in case it takes you longer than you expect to get another job. You could take a temporary job, cut your spending, move to another place. Also, think about your best-case scenario - what you ideally want to do next."]},{"begin":"1263.360","end":"1283.440","lines":["Takeaway three - as you interview for jobs, highlight what you are proud of from your last role and what you're most excited about going forward. Don't be afraid to talk about getting laid off. They'll understand."]},{"begin":"1283.440","end":"1312.240","lines":["And takeaway four - make a list of the moments from your career or beyond that have really excited you. When have you felt the most fulfilled? Then list your priorities for your next step. It might not seem like it, but a layoff can be an opportunity to pivot or to dream even bigger."]},{"begin":"1312.240","end":"1360.320","lines":["For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.
