      "text": "This is NPR's LIFE KIT. It's Earth week. And let's not dance around it - being an Earthling isn't easy these days. Flash floods and devastating earthquakes, extreme heat and shrinking ecosystems and rising sea levels and raging forest fires - no matter where you are in the planet, the effects of the climate crisis are vast and real. They're a constant source of big worry and fear for most and big struggles for many. It can be easy to feel hopeless amid so many compounding disasters or frustrated by the snail-slow pace of change. And it's true - individual action has its limits, but it's not too late to come together and make a real difference."

      "text": "According to a recent report from the U.N., the world can still avoid the most extreme dangers of the climate crisis if, collectively, nations can work together to embrace the solutions and technology needed to cut emissions rapidly. Again, to be clear, we're not putting solving the climate crisis on you, listener. That's done by governments and policies. But we know that our decisions matter. Using less energy at home, choosing to live and work in walkable areas, composting, upcycling - all of these individual choices can add up and help tip the scales towards progress. And the good news is there are endless ways to start."

So I started composting in the past couple years, but I live in an apartment and don't have any outdoor space, so I compost in my freezer. And then once a week, I take this sort of alien-looking popsicle of frozen peels and pits and rinds and coffee grounds, and I drop it off at my community garden. And it's kind of fun 'cause you get to meet other people in your neighborhood doing the same thing, and you get to spy on their eating habits, too."

There's vermicomposting, which is where you take a big sort of five-gallon bin, order some worms online and compost indoors. And then there's also the Japanese method of bokashi, which is essentially fermenting your food scraps. So there's a lot to look into."

I got to say, when I sit down and think about the plastics problem for too long, I get really overwhelmed. Like, I know we're not going to recycle our way out of the climate crisis, so I've definitely questioned how much my actions, like, as an individual can make an impact. But working on the piece helped me recognize on a very emotional level that some action is better than none."

It will help you understand not only how much plastic you're using but also how you're using it. So you can make an actionable plan about how to cut back."

After you finish your inventory, think about ways you can reduce your use of those plastics."

I also recently discovered that there's a shop down the street from me that lets you bring in your own containers and buy hand soap and dried goods. So I'm going to check that out later this week. I also tried switching over to toothpaste tabs at some point, but my partner hated the texture and, like, hard vetoed that swap. So those are out."

Write to your politicians and demand more climate action. Tell your favorite companies what green practices you want to see from them or divest from ones that don't have them. Amplify the work of climate scientists on your social media or voice your support for sustainability bills. We can all make a big impact with our words, our wallets and the ballot box.
