The caption says the fabric is from IKEA."

Maybe you're like me, and someone in your family taught you how to use a sewing machine when you were a kid. Or last spring, you got really into making masks and thought, hey, I kind of like this. What else could I make? Or maybe you have never sewn a stitch in your life, but you have a vision to recreate that amazing, perfect pair of shorts you wore every day the summer after high school. Whatever skill level you're at, we are going to walk you through everything you need to know to sew a simple garment or get started with a smaller project like hemming a skirt or patching your favorite pair of jeans."

You can just go buy a pack of assorted hand-sewing needles. And that's all you need for the very basics. If you want to step up one tiny increment from there, then I like to use beeswax when I sew. So I like to run the thread through some beeswax, and it prevents it from tangling."

It's either metal or sometimes a leather protector for the end of your finger so that when you're pushing the needle through the fabric, you don't make a hole in your finger. And so if you're going to do a lot of hand sewing, I would definitely recommend learning to sew with a thimble. But if it's just the occasional button, it's really unnecessary."

You could probably pick up all those supplies for about $35. If you don't already have them, you're also going to need an iron and an ironing board. And if you're thinking about getting a sewing machine, look for one that's mechanical. If you do end up buying a sewing machine, start by playing around with a few extra scraps of fabric just to get the feel for it. That's what Michael did when he first started out."

      "author": "CRAMER",
      "text": "One note here - if you're looking to upscale something from a thrift store, buy clothes in your own size. Everyone deserves to score amazing vintage finds that fit their bodies. Other things to look out for when you're picking fabric - check whether it's knit or woven. Knit fabric tends to be soft and stretchy, like T-shirt material. And you need a special needle to sew with it. Woven fabric like cotton, canvas or linen might be easier for beginners. You might also want to do some research on how different materials feel and move and what would feel good for you."

And as a rule of thumb, (laughter), if you're doing a burn test, if it's melting, if it smells like plastic, it's not a natural fiber (laughter). If it smells like hair burning, then it's probably wool, OK? Or it could be silk. If it smells like paper or wood burning, then it could be a cotton or a linen, that kind of thing. So your nose will tell you. And also whether it's like melting into a blob of plastic, as well."

If you've been churning out cloth masks all year, you might already have some elastic at home. But if you're making, say, a pair of shorts, you're going to want a different kind of elastic, something maybe an inch or an inch and a half wide. Whatever your first project is, if you're sewing clothes for the very first time, even something simple, you are probably going to make a mistake. And you're probably going to learn from it."

So that mistake I've literally carried with me throughout these seven years, where I'm like before I cut, I check the stretch in the fabric (laughter). But in the beginning, you're kind of just free of all that. You don't really know. So you kind of just got to keep your mind open to learning throughout the entire process."

So my mom took me to the fabric store and very patiently stood back while I got in way over my head. I think there must have been a whole section of Halloween costume patterns because I ended up with this little paper packet that had a couple of different versions of the same witchy dress on the front. I picked out some fabric to go with it. And then I got home and opened up the packet and pulled out the pattern, and a wave of despair washed over me. I needed instructions for the instructions. What I didn't know then was that sewing with patterns like that takes a ton of experience."

They have quite minimal instructions, and they assume a lot of knowledge."

Both are beginner-friendly and should help you build up the skills you need to sew with a pattern or without one. Leila's recommendation is to start with a pattern from an independent pattern company. This is how I got back into sewing clothes after my terrible Halloween costume experience in middle school. Independent pattern designers tend to have a smaller selection of projects. Those projects can come with much more detailed instructions. Some even have sew-alongs. These are step-by-step tutorials with pictures and videos to walk people through the confusing parts. Leila makes at least one of these tutorials for every pattern at her company, Muna and Broad."

When society is telling you the whole time that there's something wrong with your body and that you should change it, to have a sewing pattern that sees your body for what it is and sees its shapes and curves and recognizes that in the construction of the sewing pattern, I think it's really powerful."

If you're taking your measurements for the first time, there are a bunch of tutorials on how to do that on YouTube. Also, you can always start with a mockup, maybe with fabric left over from another project, to see if you need to alter the pattern before cutting into that fancy linen.

      "text": "OK, let's recap what we've learned so far. First of all, you don't need much to get started. You probably already have some of what you need, including fabric and clothes to upcycle into something new. If you do need to get supplies, a basic hand sewing kit doesn't cost too much, and you might be able to borrow a sewing machine or find a used one before buying something new. Second, keep it simple. Pick a project without buttons or zippers. Third, whether you're sewing with a pattern or without one, look for a project that comes with a step-by-step tutorial. Fourth, I'm going to quote Leila on this one - your body is your body, and if clothes don't fit it, it's the clothes' problem. It's not your body's problem. Figuring out a good fit might involve some trial and error. It's all part of the process. Our final take away - find your community. There are probably a whole bunch of people out there trying to figure out the same things you are. And here's a little bonus tip, courtesy of Michael's daughter, Eva, that's going to come in handy when you're ready to show the world what you made."

So usually once she kind of puts something on, out loud, she'll say exactly how she feels - I feel beautiful or, you know, I love this, especially if she can spin and twirl in it, like that's going to, like, really do something for her. I think, too, she would say, like, be proud, like making sure that, you know, you're, you know, feeling good and proud of yourself and giving yourself credit for what you're actually doing. It's, like, very important."
