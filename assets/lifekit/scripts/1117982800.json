That's all I was taught. And until I went natural 2 1/2 years ago, I accepted that as a fact of life. I often asked why it was protocol to have my hair, everyone's hair, straightened all the time. The response was usually vague, but the sentiment was all the same to me - my natural hair wasn't enough."

It's kind of comforting to know that the ups and downs of my natural hair journey are rooted in generations of Black folks simply trying to survive and reframe what they knew. That's my history, which we should get back to because we left things on a grim note. Hair straightening was a cultural standard, a means to fit in. But when the mid-20th century came, so did an embrace of natural hair in the Black community. You're likely familiar with images from the 1960s of Angela Davis and members of the Black Panther Party wearing afros as a political symbol."

When I went natural, I would look at pictures of other people and use their hair as a baseline for what I wanted to achieve. I thought that healthy hair had to be really thick and shiny. And since my hair is pretty thin, I was ready to give up. The truth is, everyone has different hair traits. So setting goals based on other people is ineffective. By understanding these first three elements, you'll know what's normal and healthy for your hair. First is texture."
    },
    {
      "author": "OLLARVIA",
      "text": "Texture is the diameter of your actual hair strand. So people can have very, very fine hair strands, meaning they only have three to five layers of cuticle - those threads are very, very thin - all the way up to coarse hair. It's a very thick strand. You can literally pull up a coarse hair strand, and if you're on a white wall and it's dark hair, somebody will see it from across the room."

Which one you have or what part - where you are on that spectrum is going to determine how much light reflects from your hair. That reflection of your surface does not have any indication on how hydrated your hair is."

      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",
      "text": "And that's something that you're born with. So, you know, you're born with either a lot of hair follicles on your head or, you know, in the middle or less. What I always say is, if you put your - all of your hair up in a ponytail, if it's a small ponytail - like, very, very small in circumference - then you have, like, a lower density."
    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "If you're freaking out about thin, low-density, matte hair, that doesn't mean there's a problem. Maybe your hair is not naturally meant to be that way. To round out this list of essential elements, the next two can help you decide what to put in your hair. There's porosity."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",
      "text": "Porosity basically refers to the way that your hair is absorbing moisture. So you can have low porosity, where your hair - it's very, very hard for your hair to uptake moisture. Then you can have high porosity, where it takes up moisture very, very quickly but it also loses the moisture just as quickly."
    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "Isfahan says that our hair should naturally be on a spectrum of low porosity. If you have very high porosity hair, that can be the result of damage from chemicals, color treatments or sun exposure. Depending on your hair's porosity, you can decide how much moisture to put in it. That's how often to wash or hydrate your hair with water. In terms of product use, the fifth and last element can help guide you - your curl pattern. If you're like me, you may have started envisioning the infamous curl chart. I still don't know if I'm 4A or 4B. But luckily, these labels aren't important. Instead, think of your curl pattern on a spectrum, and decide where you are within it."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",
      "text": "So your curl pattern is something that you're born with as well. So you can have either a straighter hair type. You can have a wavy hair type, a curly hair type and then a very coily hair type. And that's very important to understand because the more curlier your hair is, the dryer it is. And if it's dry, you need more moisture. If it's straight, it's more oily, so you need less oils and less dense products."
    },

      "author": "HANDY",

    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",
      "text": "A lot of times, with people that have textured hair, we tend to layer, like, shea butter and different types of heavy, heavy oils and things of that nature on our scalp. And then it also affects the hair, the newly formed hair coming out of that follicle. If it has to get through shea butter and heavy oils just to kind of poke through, that hair is already compromised."
    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "So if you've traditionally used oils and butters, make sure to cleanse your scalp regularly. New growth needs a clean scalp to thrive. It's also important to note that sometimes scalp care requires more than what we can provide on our own. If your scalp is super-itchy, burning, flaking consistently or thinning, that's a sign to go see a specialist. Whether you're transitioning to natural or you've been at it for a while, you should follow a simple hair care routine, which is takeaway four. You don't need a million products or hour-long wash days. Aishia says it's easy as three steps."
    },
    {
      "author": "STRICKLAND",
      "text": "Basically, you're going to cleanse with shampoo. You're going to condition and detangle your hair. And then you're going to choose a style and choose the appropriate styler with hold for that hairstyle. And more than likely, there might be some heat source involved, a diffuser or some hooded dryer of some sort and probably combined with a little air drying because just sometimes we don't have enough time. But that's basically it."
    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "Shampoo, condition, style. That's it. Depending on your lifestyle - like how active you are, what climate you live in, how much time you have on your hands and what your desired look is - you can do this three-step process at various frequencies. Aishia recommends somewhere between every four to 10 days. This is just a basic routine to get you started. Once you can keep this up for a few months, then you can consider adding a pre-shampoo oil treatment or periodic deep conditioner if you find that your hair could benefit from it. When you develop a routine that's right for you, be picky with the products you use. Before you buy something, take a look at its ingredients. Here's some that Isfahan says to avoid."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",
      "text": "So sulfates are detergents that are used for cleansing the hair. And it can be very harsh for textured hair types. For us that have drier, coily, curly hair, it's extremely harsh, and it can cause breakage and lead to damage of the hair. With things like phthalates and parabens, those are just toxic ingredients. Phthalates are used in, like, fragrances, so you definitely want to use a product that says phthalate-free fragrance."
    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "So remember - sulfates can dry out natural hair, while parabens and phthalates can be toxic to the body. There are also ingredients that are beneficial to your hair. Across the board, using products with water as their first ingredient is a good place to start. But here's some more specific ones to look for."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",

    },
    {
      "author": "HANDY",
      "text": "BTMS stands for behentrimonium methosulfate. It's a chemical compound and softening ingredient that can help detangle the hair. Isfahan also recommends using products with plant-based alcohols. The word alcohol can sound scary, but it's nothing to fear so long as you're choosing the right ones."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHAMBERS-HARRS",

These are the things you'll want to think about in between cleansing and the three-step process we talked about before. I struggle with deciding what hairstyles to do on a daily basis.

One last thing - for me, going natural is a step towards living life truly for myself. There's no denying the discrimination that some Black people face on account of their hair. I thought that going natural had to be a spiritual process of liberation, that we're all oppressed by straight hair and need to free ourselves. What I didn't realize is that the most freeing part of this all is choosing to do whatever you want. Why go natural? Is there something special about it?"

Takeaway two - transition by cutting any damaged hair. Whether it's the big chop or a long transition, this will help prevent damage to new natural hair growth.

Cleanse with shampoo, condition, and then style. With any product you use, make sure you pay close attention to the ingredients. Takeaway five - maintain your hair through styling.
