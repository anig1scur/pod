  "intro": "Improvising in the kitchen takes a lot of practice. But when you get to that point in the recipe where you realize you're out of white wine/fresh garlic/brown sugar/whatever you absolutely MUST have for this recipe, being able to swap in another ingredient can really come in handy. Chef and author Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt and cook and food writer Deb Perelman walk us through the basics of food substitutions.",

I barely knew how to follow a recipe, so I had to learn how to do that, and then I had to figure out how to substitute with the ingredients that I could find. My first lesson and today's first takeaway is get to know your taste buds."

      "author": "MORTADA",

Ingredients that fall into the same category can often be swapped out. And if you don't know where to start, you can definitely ask the internet for suggestions. I Google stuff all the time, and there are lots of great ideas on how to swap out ingredients."
    },
    {
      "author": "MORTADA",
      "text": "But you can also really lean into your senses and think about how they're being activated. Where does the flavor hit your tongue? Do you feel the heat from something spicy? What do you smell? And does that smell impact what you taste? Does the bite you just took feel creamy or silky in your mouth? Is there a little sweetness you can feel coat your tongue? Is it balanced with something salty or sour? Acids, like lemon juice or lime juice or different types of vinegars, might trigger your cheeks to scrunch up or a sensation on the sides or back of your tongue. It can really add some brightness to a dish and draw out other flavors."

      "author": "LOPEZ-ALT",

It really - mostly, it's coming through your nose. And so if I don't particularly like cumin, well, I can probably swap it out with coriander or white pepper or another one of these things that is mainly an aroma component, and the dish will smell different in the end, but the general way the flavors work together and the way my tongue perceives it should still be balanced, as long as I'm leaving sort of the fattiness and the sweetness and the saltiness and the acidity at the same level."

Fats are a great way to soften vegetables as you saute them, and they can add a depth of flavor or texture to a dish. Some examples are olive oil, coconut oil, butter or ghee. Other fats are things like heavy cream or cashew milk or even cheese. What you choose can depend on when you add it to a dish."

So if you're trading in one type of salt for another, add it gradually to make sure you're not oversalting or overseasoning your dish, which leads us to takeaway No. 2 - taste your dish as you cook, and add salt, spices and other flavors accordingly."

If somebody makes a recipe and it has eight onions and 12 cloves of garlic and a can of tomatoes and three chili peppers and they tell me it was bland, I'm like, I think it was salt. It really needs to be seasoned. When you're pinching salt into a pot of soup, it's not going to do it. It's a whole pot. It's, like, 12 servings. It's not a pinch. It's a lot (laughter).

      "text": "When it comes to seasoning, she says to consider the amount of what you're cooking and adjust how much salt, spices or acids you add based on how much you're making. So if you're doubling a recipe, chances are you'll need to double the seasoning. You'll also need to adjust based on what you use to replace an ingredient. Remember earlier when I was cooking my mussels? I replaced the wine in my recipe with white wine vinegar. The recipe called for half a cup of wine, but vinegar is way more acidic, and half a cup would overpower the dish. So instead, I put two tablespoons of vinegar in a measuring cup, and I added water to reach half a cup of liquid."

      "text": "Sometimes, searing or browning before you start adding other ingredients can add a more robust flavor to a dish. If you simmer a bunch of ingredients in liquid over the course of an hour, that'll let flavors mingle and develop more deeply than if they were just warmed together in 15 minutes. Slowly sauteing vegetables, like onions, can help them caramelize, making them sweet and jammy, but if you quickly pan-fry them or roast them on high heat, they can become crispy. Understanding the technique can give you a lot of flexibility to figure out what you can substitute, including what type of pan you should use, especially if you don't have the same equipment a recipe suggests."

      "author": "LOPEZ-ALT",
      "text": "A recipe that requires a lot of heavy searing of, like, meats and things like that, you generally want something really heavy that's going to retain heat. So you could do it in a Dutch oven. You could do it in a cast-iron pan. You could do it in a tri-ply stainless steel skillet. And whereas a recipe that requires very, very rapid temperature adjustments - so like a lot of stir-fried recipes, for example - you're going to want something that's a little bit thinner and lighter so that you can adjust on the fly. If a recipe calls for putting something in the oven, you want something that's going to be oven-safe."

The fat will melt over time, and you'll get lots of richness without running into chewy pieces. Those cuts can be something like a chuck roast or a pork shoulder or a leg of lamb. If you're looking to grill or sear a cut of meat, like if you're making a steak or chicken breast or burgers, that's quick-cooking."

I just realize that for almost any mushroom - wild mushroom - pasta sauce or risotto, you can use cremini mushrooms. It's fine. It's about the way you cook them and how you season them almost as much as the mushrooms you have. And I think it's really important that people know that because the amount of steps, the amount of miles and the amount of expense that goes into getting that one ingredient may not have changed the recipe fundamentally for the person who made it at home."

My name is Alisa Persita (ph), and my LIFE KIT tip is about putting away your grocery cart when you're grocery shopping, especially when you have young children with you or when it's - the weather isn't great, if it's cold. My tip is to park right next to one of the areas that you put the cart away. That way, you don't have to walk across the parking lot, especially if you have a little one in the car strapped in already. So you also get some extra steps in this way. So typically, the place where you put it away is farther in the parking lot. So if you just find one that has a parking spot next to it, you're also getting in some extra steps."
