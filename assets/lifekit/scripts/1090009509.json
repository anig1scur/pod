In today's dopamine-filled world, here's how keep that balance in check.",

      "text": "So one of the most interesting findings in neuroscience in the past 75 years is that pleasure and pain are co-located in the brain. So that means that the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain, and they work like opposite sides of a balance. So if you imagine that in your brain, there's a teeter-totter, like in a kid's playground - and when it's at rest, it's level with the ground. When we experience pleasure, it tips one way; when we experience pain, it tips the other. But one of the overarching rules governing this balance is that it wants to remain level. It doesn't want to be tipped for very long to the side of pleasure or pain, and our brains will work very hard to restore a level balance, or what neuroscientists call homeostasis."

And when we're not using, we're experiencing the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance, which are anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria and craving. And we're so insulated from really our bodies and the kinds of painful experiences that our bodies were designed to tolerate that we've ended up in this dopamine deficit state where we feel incredibly depressed and nihilistic and unhappy and we don't know why. And so what do we do? We reach for more of those things that give us pleasure in the short term. And yet those are the very things that are creating the despair in the first place."

But if they can just hang in there and wait long enough without using, those neuroadaptation gremlins, we'll start to slowly hop off the pain side, homeostasis will be restored and they'll be able to again take pleasure in more modest rewards. And the majority of my patients, if they're able to do this intervention, will come back endorsing a significant improvement in depression, anxiety and motivation."

So, you know, there are clearly, you know, limits to this intervention.

So examples of, like, a literal, physical, self-binding - I have patients who, when they're traveling, they will call the hotel in advance and say, please remove the minibar and the television set, because they know that once they're in the hotel room and they've got access to, you know, pornography or Netflix or whatever it is they're trying to avoid."

He was convinced the video games were the only thing alleviating his depression. But in fact they were driving the depression. When he abstained for 30 days, he felt better than he had in years. So when he went back to using video games, he wanted to use differently, he wanted to use less and he wanted to have a different kind of attachment to the video games. And he accomplished that in part with categorical self-binding, where he only let himself play certain video games. For example, he did not let himself play League of Legends because he found that was just too addictive, and he only let himself play with friends and not strangers."

And it's the kind of pain that could derail our lives and create so much depression and anxiety that we can't go forward or live a flourishing life. And that's the kind of pain that should be avoided. But there's also the kind of pain that you write about that's for a purpose. How do we strike the right balance? I guess I just need help distinguishing between pain that's for a purpose and then the pain that comes from overly hedonistic behavior."

So if you think again about the balance, you've got the initial stimulus, which is the intoxicant, and then you've got the pain that comes from the gremlins, which is the brain's attempt to compensate for the intoxicant. That's a distinct type of pain, right? That's the pain of withdrawal or the pain of the comedown. But it turns out that the gremlins are agnostic to which side of the balance they jump on.

In other words, by doing that exercise, we are moving our pleasure-pain set point closer to pleasure. So that can be a very healthy and adaptive way to get our dopamine, and it's less vulnerable to this problem of tolerance and addiction because we have to work for it initially, right? The initial piece of it is hard. It takes activation energy. It takes motivation."

And I think absolutely the answer is yes. It's very clear that we can tolerate much more pain or even experience pain differently if it's contextualized to be not just about us, but about doing some good in the world or helping other individuals.

I have seen countless patients now over two-plus decades, and the ones with the severest addiction who are in the best recovery are the ones who have taught me they can't lie about anything at all.

      "text": "Anna, you are an expert. You are a doctor in addiction treatment, and much of your book details treatment protocols that can be applied to all of us. And so I just want to ask you to zoom out and explain how the treatment for overconsumption that you know so well is really a universal process to understand. It's something that all of us should kind of get."

      "text": "Yeah. I mean, whether or not you're struggling with the bona fide disease of addiction or just struggling, like all of us, with daily compulsive overconsumption - maybe it's food, maybe it's tech, maybe it's sex - you know, this is a universal problem today. We are all struggling with this. And so in order to restore our sanity, we really need to rethink how we are going to navigate this dopamine-overloaded world. And I think that people with addiction in recovery are modern-day prophets for how to do this. They've had to figure it out for life and death reasons. They have an enormous amount of wisdom to give to the rest of us. And really what it comes down to is we have to start to intentionally avoid pleasure and seek out pain. And by doing that, we will reset reward pathways and ultimately be a lot happier. Again, it's simple but not easy. But it's well worth doing."

      "text": "So I make spaghetti a lot, and I use jarred marinara sauce. So when I pour the sauce into the pan with my veggies or whatever I'm cooking, I then fill up the pasta jar that's now emptied with about two inches of hot water. And then I put the lid back on, and I shake it up and pour it into the pan with the rest of the sauce. That way, it gets every last bit of the sauce that's been left behind and it stretches my sauce a little bit more. But also, it takes away some of the rinsing that I have to do before I put it in the recycling. So it saves water."
