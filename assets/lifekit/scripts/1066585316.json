  "intro": "It's counterintuitive, but an effective way to manage our negative reactions to life's stressors actually involves slowing down and paying very close attention. Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of mindfulness-based stress reduction, explains how to begin a meditation practice \u2014 and how doing so can help you seize the present moment.",

What does it mean to be able to think and feel? And what kind of ways do we have to navigate our own lives rather than being more like a billiard ball being bounced around the table rather than charting one's own path?"

      "text": "So where does meditation fit into mindfulness?"
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "So mindfulness is often spoken of as the heart of Buddhist meditation. So it's a form of meditation that really is the cultivation of intimacy with awareness. We have to learn to enter the domain of awareness because so much of the time, we're living in distraction. And that was true for thousands of years. So we didn't have to wait for the iPhone to be distracted. But now we're distracted to an infinitely higher degree than ever before. And just on average, people check their phones about 260 times a day - just to check, not to answer the phone but to just check the phone to see whether there's anything interesting happening."
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "So in all those 260 moments, we're really distracting ourselves from what's happening in the present moment. Mindfulness can slow it down to the pace of life, so to speak, so that we actually are capable of driving our own vehicle, so to speak, and living optimal lives of well-being that are not merely self-centered to optimize things for ourselves, but that, actually, the more we are our full dimensionality of being, the more we are there for our family, for our children, for our, you know, partners, for our friends and for our colleagues at work and for the world itself, you know - which I don't have to tell anybody who's listening to NPR that the diagnosis of the condition of the world at this particular moment in time is kind of like an acute chronic disease."
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "And so practices that we use in MBSR for individual patients actually are very appropriate to apply on a global level and on the societal level to deal with the inherent dissipative forces that are actually pulling us apart, to say nothing of burning down the lungs of the planet in the form of the rainforest and heating the planet at the same time."

      "text": "It is. It is. And for everybody who's listening to this who's like, yes, yes, I want this in my life, I want to figure out how to be more authentically myself, I want to be more aware, and I want to be a better steward to this planet - where do they start if they've never had a mindfulness practice?"
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "Yeah, good question. And the other thing is, of course, if you are simply aware of all of the catastrophic things that are happening, you might feel completely disempowered and depressed and anxious about the whole thing. So where do you start? There's only one place to start."
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "And that's in the present moment, outside of time, because it turns out that, interestingly enough, when we use the word now, it has a timeless dimension to it. It's over almost before the word can come out of our mouth or move through our mind. And so it's now, now, now, now, now. And the question is, can we actually fall awake and inhabit our awareness moment by moment by moment?"
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "Right off the bat, this is an invitation to just drop in and experience the actuality of, say, the body - breathing. So in this moment, if you're not driving out there as you're listening to this and you can close your eyes..."

      "text": "...One of the first things you'll notice when you drop in in this way on your own experience is that there's breath going on. I won't say you're breathing because whoever you think you are, if it were up to you to be breathing, you would have died a long time ago."
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "This is a very powerful door into the present moment because we don't care about yesterday's breath or the next breath or the last breath. The only thing we care about is this breath. And so I'll punctuate this with a little silence at the moment for you to just experience a few breaths, one by one, moment by moment, just surfing or riding on the wave of your own breathing in and your own breathing out. And the feeling of it, not the thinking about it but the feeling of the sensations of the breath coming in and out as I'm speaking, that's awareness. And so after not very long, you've probably discovered it already, but the mind is going to start..."

And so when you notice that your mind - which you gave the assignment to feel the breath in the present moment - when you notice it's not doing that, but it's off someplace else, having lunch in a restaurant or reviewing something that happened a long time ago or caught up in some emotion about being disregarded or offended or whatever it is, notice what's on your mind in this moment because you know what? It's on your mind in this moment. You're back in the present moment. Soon as you recognize that, oh, I am off the breath; I don't even remember the breath. And look. Guess what? The body's going to be totally loyal, and it will keep on breathing so you can begin again."

    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "And what's growing is a lot more interesting than a muscle. What grows is your access to awareness and ability to, in some sense, live an awake and aware of life and let that become your, more or less, go-to mode or your default mode, rather than being in stress reactivity all the time and really being, more or less, mindless, especially when the proverbial stuff is hitting the proverbial fan. That's when we tend to see red and lose our minds completely."
    },
    {
      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",
      "text": "And then one last thing is that the real meditation practice is the 24 hours itself. It's life itself. So it's not sitting on a cushion in a cross-legged posture or lying in a yoga pose called the corpse pose or anything like that. That's all fabulous. But we're cultivating that so that we get more comfortable with living our - all our moments as if they really mattered and, therefore, being there for them - the good ones, the bad ones, the ugly ones, the stressful ones, the difficult ones, the painful ones - and understanding that the more our heart and mind open in awareness, the more we have new degrees of freedom that are both profoundly healthy and healing but also help us learn, grow and transform across life itself."

You know, full disclosure, I, too, have an app out there called JKZ Meditations because, you know, if you don't go with the technology of the moment, you can't actually reach people in ways that might have a kind of profound personal and societal effect. And so there are, like, wonderful meditation teachers out there. And it doesn't matter which meditation teacher or which app you tune into or follow. The whole point is that, ultimately, you trust yourself because you are the actual arbiter, so to speak, of authenticity. When something doesn't ring right, ring true to you, let it be. Let it go. Find what resonates in your heart."

And you won't be in any emotional pain or physical pain. And that meditation is some special state. And if you're doing it right, you'll just nail it. You'll just land it. And then everything will be fantastic. And that is..."

And there's no special state that you're supposed to attain. So it's the hardest work in the world. It's also the easiest work in the world if you're willing to actually be touched enough by whatever your impulse is to care about it or to care about yourself in this way. And then the benefits are just vast. And the costs are minimal in a way because you're working on non-distraction. And since we're so distracted always anyway, we're not really ourselves when we're not really present."

      "author": "KABAT-ZINN",

Well, you still can be aware of what stopping yoga for a period of time does compared to when you're doing yoga. You can feel it in your body. And that will wake you up and remind you that might be good to get back to the mat. So the important thing is to just do it, to practice and let the practice wind up doing you. It's not about getting to some special stage. It's about realizing how special every moment is, whether you're distracted or not. But the realizing of even distraction is not distracted. It's wakefulness."

It's coming from you. And it's coming from the dance that's happening between my voice and your heart and your ears. And there's a certain kind of mystery to this where we're all each other's teachers. And we're all each other's fellow humans."

When people drop into silence around the circle, which is what humanity did for millions of years as we evolved into Homo sapiens, this has kind of imprinted itself in our genes and nervous system in ways that we hardly understand. But we have a common humanity that we need to begin to recognize on a planetary scale."
