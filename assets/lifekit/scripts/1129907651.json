      "text": "It made Clay think about when he did say no to his kid - maybe to avoid a mess or frustration or screaming. But life is messy and frustrating - that can't be avoided. Sometimes, a girl has got to scream. So instead of shutting things down completely and saying no full stop, we can open up and become curious. Uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but it can turn into something rewarding."

    {
      "author": "DRINKO",

I was the wealthy aunt, Ms. Broccoli Rabay (ph), but it's actually pronounced broccoli rabe, like rob a bank. I didn't know that before the scene began, but I definitely found out when my team members looked at me in bewildered confusion. And, you know, in this imaginary world where I'm clutching my mink stole and grasping the pearls around my neck, why wouldn't I be a Ms. Broccoli Rabay?"

I needed to use that can of tomatoes anyway. When we acknowledge mistakes, we find that they don't have the life-shattering effect that we imagined them to have, and the weight we give them often doesn't match up with reality."

Now, onto our next takeaway. Takeaway No. 3 - don't shy away from yourself. This sounds a bit conceptual, but stick with me. OK. So full disclosure - I didn't start taking improv classes because I thought I was funny."

And if you are outside of that, the majority of the culture, which is - improv is majority cishet, white folk - it is more difficult for people to understand the power of your comedic point of view. They see that you're funny, but they don't see the depth of it."
    },

      "author": "ALADESUYI",
      "text": "I think, like, for me, when I was growing up kind of, like, in this 1.5 - like, first-generation-and-a-half immigrant - I just felt like being embedded in a culture where like, things were funny. I just, like, didn't necessarily have those points of reference."

      "author": "GONZALEZ",

    },
    {
      "author": "GONZALEZ",
      "text": "And also, Kemi, you're funny. Everyone is funny. It's about how you're utilizing your ability to recognize what's around you and see the silliness of it because existing is silly. And I think it's also about embracing that because there's power in that."
    },

      "author": "ALADESUYI",
      "text": "I should disclose - again - I'm not the fun friend. I'm the pragmatic one. I'm the one who tells my friends to burn it all down because it feels like the world is already on fire. Like, it can be kind of hard to have fun at brunch when you think about the folks in Jackson, Miss., who still don't have clean water to drink. I'm not a full-on Debbie Downer, but gloom does feel like a strong choice to bring to improv class - which I've done, actually. Let me tell you about a scene I did once. My partner was Santa, and they'd suggest toy I could get for Christmas, and I'd find some reason to shut them down. I couldn't get a motorized mini car because I have to think about the environment. A toy robot would be a cruel gift since Mommy and Daddy had just lost their jobs to automation. And when Santa offered me a Barbie doll with its unrealistic proportions and beauty standards, I could only roll my eyes. Real-world darkness isn't a fun thing to think about, but I had to stop worrying that my view of the world wasn't worth sharing."
    },

      "author": "GONZALEZ",
      "text": "In our class, that's one of the things that I wanted people to do. It's like, I want you to just exist in what's real to you. Even if it may be painful, even if it may make you feel awkward, that truth will resonate and will connect with someone. And it may not connect with everyone, but you can't worry about that."

      "author": "GONZALEZ",
      "text": "I can't worry that people are not going to see me. Because I see me. In being in a room where you feel unencumbered by the internal edits, the code switching, the doubt that you will be seen the way you feel like you're meant to be seen - once that's alleviated, you realize there's just power in you being you."

      "text": "Because you're being allowed to be yourself in a way you thought you couldn't. And that's powerful. So much of queerness is about understanding yourself but also loving yourself in a way you thought you couldn't. And that's emotional, and that's powerful."
    },
    {
      "author": "ALADESUYI",
      "text": "But we can do that for ourselves. We can appreciate our complexities. We can show off the parts of ourselves that we may have the impulse to hide. That third takeaway, to not shy away, is the most important thing I've learned in improv. It's a practice of radical acceptance and self-love. It doesn't happen overnight, and it may be hard to do in some places, but keep reminding yourself that your voice matters. If you feel yourself becoming small, name how you feel. Giving that experience a name puts some distance between you and what you're experiencing. While we may not always receive empathy, it's something we all deserve. I've found a space where it felt a little easier to be myself at Squirrel Comedy Theater, and it's helped me bring a bit more of myself everywhere."

And in that scene, I was able to assert my dignity and power in a safe enough container. And that was so powerful for me. And that was the second improv class, and then on from then, I was sold. I was sold on the magic of improv."

      "text": "You don't have to make it to an improv class to reap these benefits. Being aware of your emotions and actually feeling them is being present in your body. Meditating, doing some breathing exercises or simply going outside to cloud watch are easy ways to feel that presence. When I go grocery shopping, I like to take my time looking at the fruits and veggies before I put them in my cart. Really look, feel and smell things - the marigolds, ochres and siennas in a bag of golden raisins, the gradient of a daikon radish turning from white to purple, the soft bristles of an African yam. I'm present in the moment, and I'm living fully."

      "text": "Our fifth and final takeaway is make room to play. It's the last lesson we have time for, but I think it's the core of what we do in improv. We make up games. We laugh at absurd scenarios. We're at play. And when we apply the tools we've learned to be less in our heads and more in our bodies, we're creating space to play as well."

    {
      "author": "SAJID",
      "text": "I think improv can create the structure and the container where we can be silly without harmful consequences. Because a lot of times in our lives, we are not given that kind of humanity. I think being silly and attuning to what silliness looks like for us is a real gift in adulthood, and it's actually a very healing thing for us to do."
    },

      "author": "ALADESUYI",
      "text": "It can feel selfish and unproductive to take time to play, to do something that doesn't seem to have an immediate utility, something that we aren't trying to commodify. Lots of things feel like they should be higher up on the to-do list. But play is important. So I invite you to make more space for it in your life. It can be as simple as singing in the shower or making time to doodle while you eat lunch. It can be whimsical. Maybe get out to the park and blow some bubbles, splash in puddles when it rains. Clay Drinko likes to watch how his children play, and you might think about doing the same. It might spark some memories of things you loved to do when you were little. You can find joy when you look at some things in a new light."

    {
      "author": "ALADESUYI",
      "text": "So let's recap. What can we take away from improv and apply to our everyday lives? Takeaway No. 1 - yes, and. When we say yes to things, we're staying curious and being open to the unexpected, and we can increase our tolerance for uncertainty. It's a win-win. Takeaway No. 2 - embrace mistakes. They are often not as world-shattering as we might think. When we choose to acknowledge them, we can find humor and connection. Takeaway No. 3 - don't shy away from yourself. We can find strength in cherishing the parts of ourselves that others might ignore. Takeaway No. 4 - be present in your body, and let yourself feel your emotions. And our last takeaway, takeaway No. 5 - make room to play. Take off your shoes on your next walk through a field of grass and feel the earth breathe between your toes. Pick up a card game with friends. Go to karaoke and sing with no shame. Make a flower garland and bask in the beauty of being alive."
