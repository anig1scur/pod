You put on a pair of shoes, but they're clearly just the wrong pair. You're trying to chug hot coffee 'cause you don't have a to-go mug. And you realize you're going to be late.

      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "I think it really comes down to several factors. The first that I see a lot is that people aren't aware of the passage of time, especially when it comes to getting ready for an upcoming meeting or an appointment. They'll usually be distracted. Something else will be on their mind. Or they think they can squeeze one more thing in."

    {
      "author": "FURLAN",

      "text": "What can be some of the consequences of being late?"
    },
    {
      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "The first thing I think is that it just messes up the rest of our schedules. You know, we've taken the time to, you know, book something, and we do our best to arrive on time. And then when we're not on time, it just shuffles and can interrupt the whole flow of the day. Secondly, it can really be upsetting to not only the flow of the day but the people that we interact with on a regular basis. When we're not on time, that can cause a ripple effect or a cascade that ends up influencing other people in their lives."
    },
    {
      "author": "FURLAN",
      "text": "So it's basically, like, if you're late, you're affecting every single other thing that that person has to do for the rest of the day. So, like, the consequences can be unseen in a certain way. And maybe there's a domino effect that you are - you're pushing down a domino, and you don't even know."

      "text": "Sure, sure."
    },
    {
      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "So the first thing I think that is very important when one wants to be on time is to be honest and truthful and to recognize that there is something that's not working. It can be a either denial of time, of how much time it actually takes to travel from one place to another, a denial of actually wanting to go to the appointment or understanding how much is involved in preparation for an appointment. Sometimes, it's just not being comfortable with the passage of time, being on time to something and being comfortable and willing to let time pass so that you can enter that appointment calm, cool and collected."
    },
    {
      "author": "FURLAN",
      "text": "I think I have this, where if I am very early to something, I feel anxious. I feel, like, lost, uncomfortable. What am I doing here? I don't know what to do with my hands. It's a bizarre sort of - like, I feel like it's anxiety. And I wonder if there's a reframing that needs to happen of that time."
    },
    {
      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "Yeah, yeah. No, I would certainly agree. I think in this society, we have just been trained to go, go, go, go. And when we have that break or pause, we often don't know what to do with it. We haven't understood or learned that along with filling time, we also have to be comfortable with the passage of time and if that means doing nothing at all or just waiting or taking a break."
    },
    {
      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "So I think that's where it comes in - when people may be early to an appointment. And it could be on time - let's say 15 minutes, 10 minutes - and then they have time, and they don't know what to do with it. Oddly enough, that might be the same person who will say, gosh, I really wish I just had 10 minutes to catch my breath. So I think, you know, in this case, it definitely is a shifting of mindset."

Am I thinking that I'm going to be uncomfortable when I arrive? Am I not really interested in meeting the people that I'm going to meet? There's a lot of things that can be uncovered here (laughter)."

      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "Yeah. I mean, I think there - you know, there is not that necessary pressure, like you said, of, oh, I have to get to a place. But at the same time, it's important to be aware that even those meetings with our friends or acquaintances, you know, it does have a ripple effect. And people do feel that because when you're late by however many minutes, that's doing them a disservice because, well, one, they're not spending time with you."

    },
    {
      "author": "ISIP",
      "text": "Sure. So if you know you're going to be late to something, the very best thing you can do is communicate right away. And it's not communicating - by communicating right away, I mean right away. It's not thinking about it and then calling or texting 30 minutes later. It means right at that moment. If you have that feeling that I'm not going to be there, let the person know. It's just a courtesy - and to let them know so they can adjust their schedule if necessary. I think it's better, actually, to call; use the phone so you can, you know, speak."

So if possible, call and say to the person - you know, very clearly, just say, you know, it looks like I'm going to be late to, you know, this meeting. You know, my apologies. I'll do my best to be there on time. I'm expecting to be there at this time, and I'll let you know if, you know, there's any other delays."

And I came back, and I was, like, 45 minutes late to everything for so long. And it felt like I had just - I had changed my concept of what was OK and what was polite and what was - what time really meant. Can you speak a little bit to the sort of, like, different cultural meanings of time and lateness across societies? It's not all what it is in the United States, I guess. Yeah."

Yes, different societies have different structures in place when it comes to lateness, and I think that's a great point to bring up because it does, you know, matter when you're in one place versus another.

You know, since time is a social construct, we can see it playing out in so many different ways in many different cultures and countries. The thing that's most important here, as well, is that honesty and being clear about, OK, well, where are we? (Laughter)."

So, you know, what can we plan ahead to make that transition time easier on ourselves? And then, also, working backwards - how much travel time it'll take to get to the place.

So I think for people to, you know, be more aware of those segments and, like - you know, you were just doing right now. You realized, oh, yeah, there's - that happens when I'm getting ready. We might say, oh, it'll only take five minutes, but that five minutes might in actuality be 50 minutes.

It's, like, not about shame. It's not about being good or bad. It's really just about being honest with yourself and then being - and then from there being honest with other people. And like, I feel - I think that I - especially in the past, I was, like, really ruled by the sort of, like, shame of being on time.
