Whatever the case, all dogs can benefit from training throughout their lives."

They all have different combinations of letters after their names, and there is so much vocabulary - terms like positive reinforcement or force-free and e-collar, prong collar, shock collar. Should you try a group class first or send your dog straight to boarding school? There's so much information out there, but in this episode, we and some experts will help you narrow down the options."

Kim Brophey is an applied ethologist, certified dog behavior consultant and the author of \"Meet Your Dog: The Game-Changing Guide To Understanding Your Dog's Behavior.\" She's developed an entire framework to help owners understand their dog's behavior and know what is learnable for the dog and what is innate nature. It's called LEGS."

And so LEGS just helps us break it down to make sure that we can kind of identify where problems are, what are the factors that are contributing to or helping to buffer against certain behavior problems."

    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Winnie, for example, was rushing and barking at the door because of L - learning. I let her do it for two years. She learned that it was the right thing to do, so she can also unlearn that it's the right thing to do, though it'll be harder because I let her get away with it for so long, but also because of E - her environment. She ran at the door barking because she could. There was no barrier between her and the door. This is also something I can change with a door or baby gate."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "For other dogs, though, the same behavior could be caused by G - genetics - which you obviously can't change. Brophey says if you don't know what breed your dog is, it could be a good idea to do a genetic test, like Embark or Wisdom Panel, to better understand where your dog is coming from."

      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "If your dog was literally bred to defend its territory, like a German shepherd, for example, you should not go into training expecting to ever keep your dog from defending its territory. But you can manage the response, says Brophey."

      "author": "BROPHEY",
      "text": "We would help the clients just put a pattern in place where when someone comes to the front door, you thank the dog for barking their head off, give them a cookie for a job well done letting you know that the person is there, and then you say, all right, cool, take five for a lunch break. You did your job. And you take them behind a baby gate. And then once the dog is, you know, de-escalated and is calmer, then you could consider letting them join the guest."

    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "No. 1 is group classes. That's where you'd start for basic obedience training. But there are also specialized group classes - for leash reactivity, for example. Group classes are cheaper, more social and take place in a controlled environment but are less personalized to your dog."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "No. 2 is one-on-one training - more expensive, but more personalized."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Option three - board and train, like a couple-weeks-long boarding school for dogs, which can be beneficial if you don't have the time to invest in training your dog. But board and train is the most expensive and the least hands-on and potentially the riskiest since you won't be there to advocate for your dog, says Kayla Fratt."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "One of the problems with board and train is that as a trainer, you either need to charge extremely high prices or you need to have several dogs in your household all at once. So if you're not comfortable with your dog going and staying in a kennel situation, potentially in, like, heated kennels in the trainer's garage, that's a big thing to consider."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Then option four - Fratt's favorite - is day training. The trainer comes to your house, picks up your dog, trains it for a few hours and then brings it back. Your dog still gets to interact with you daily and sleep at your house every night, and it's still good for busy families."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Option five is you. If you want to handle dog training on your own, there are boatloads of free resources and videos on YouTube and Instagram."

    },
    {

      "text": "The pros here being that it's free. Dog training can be incredibly expensive. The cons being that you're on your own."

    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "Quite frankly, a lot of people are able to get through without any professional training help. Where I - in my experience, people hire me partially because they want an accountability partner."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "The option you choose will also depend on your training goals. It would be hard, for example, to train your dog not to bark at your door from a training center. If your dog is aggressive with another dog in your house, sending the aggressive dog to a board and train facility is unlikely to improve that inter-household dynamic."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Now, there's a common saying that it's really the owner who is being trained. So no matter how you choose to train your dog, you still have to be an integral part of that training. Kayla Fratt says training doesn't have to take up a huge chunk of your day, though."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "When I was raising my puppy Niffler, it was probably about five minutes a day of actual training, where I'm actually like, all right, I'm going to get my clicker out. I'm going to get the treat pouch out. We're going to sit down, and we're going to work on something"
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Avi Israeli, Winnie's trainer, comes for an hour every couple of weeks and then gives me homework - for example, play sounds such as thunderstorms, fireworks, et cetera, at low volumes while she's engaged in a pleasurable activity, such as eating. And then there's all the training you can work into everyday life as you consistently model good behavior."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "So with my puppy, every time when he was little he chose to lay at my feet quietly while I was on a Zoom call, I have a treat jar that sits on my desk, and I would drop a couple treats at him. So I wasn't actually training him, but I was like, hey, buddy, I like that. Let's keep doing that."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Dog training is - get this - a totally and completely unregulated field. Anyone with a website, Instagram page or storefront can claim to be a dog trainer. The entirety of their qualifications could be that they love dogs, which also means there is no rulebook for how to train a dog, what methods to use, and many dog trainers disagree."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "So our fourth takeaway is understand the methodology. In the dog training community, there are essentially two camps that you're likely to encounter. The first is positive reinforcement-based trainers, also sometimes called force-free or fear-free trainers. This looks like every time your puppy pees outside, you give him a treat. Every time the door slams shut in our condo building and Winnie doesn't bark, I give her a treat. Fratt offers this example of using positive reinforcement to help train a dog that is barking and growling at kids."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "Luckily, there is a playground where it was safe for me to kind of be on the other side of a fence from the playground a couple dozen meters away from the playground. And every time he looked at kids, or every time kids screamed or went down the slide or did anything that in my puppy's opinion was really scary, puppy got a treat. And puppy started learning that being around kids, kids doing things, all of that actually predicted good things for him. And at this point, he now loves kids."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "The second camp is made up of trainers who identify as balanced, which basically means trainers who are more willing to incorporate punishment, also called corrections, into their training, like Brianna Dick."
    },
    {
      "author": "DICK",
      "text": "For me, a correction can look like this. It can look like removal of food. It could look like spacial pressure. It could look like a verbal no. It can look like a spray bottle, a tap on the crate, leash pressure, e-collar. It can look like an interruption. Like, I oftentimes will use food as an interruption. But correction can mean a lot of different things. It's really dependent on the dog."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "But Dick says she never reaches for corrections first."
    },
    {
      "author": "DICK",
      "text": "The biggest example - which is my dog is reactive on the leash, right? So I go over and say, well, what does your relationship look like with your dog? Do you provide it structure and information in the home? Do you give it clear information communication on the walk? Do you limit reactivity in the home, not just on the walk? Because most of the time when clients are coming to me, they're looking at the symptom, labeling it a problem when the problem is, in general, your dog's insecure. But if I'm doing my job correctly, it should be about 95% direction and 5% correction."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "So it's a tool in your tool belt but not necessarily the first thing that you reach for."
    },
    {
      "author": "DICK",
      "text": "Exactly. If the first thing I'm reaching for is a correction, I didn't teach the dog what I needed them to do."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Dick says one of the downsides to positive reinforcement-only training is that it can take a long time. If you have a dog with severe separation anxiety that barks and barks whenever you leave him at home, maybe you don't have months and months to solve the problem."
    },
    {
      "author": "DICK",
      "text": "Is it totally fair to completely shut down the dog and correct them? Absolutely not. But is it fair for those neighbors to have to listen to a dog barking for, you know, 20 hours a day? Absolutely not. So what that looks like is, let's do as much as we can in a realistic environment. Yes, let's, you know, create structure. Let's make sure that we're following through. Let's make sure we're giving that dog exercise and all the training they need. But when push comes to shove, is it worse to correct that dog with an e-collar in the crate for 10 minutes or have that owner and that dog rehome?"
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "So you might have heard of e-collars, which Dick just mentioned and are also sometimes called shock collars. It's a collar that your dog wears, which you control via remote, that emits a stimulus to your dog's neck - a shock, sound or, say, a citronella spray - whenever she needs a correction."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "I have personally used e-collars to work with deaf dogs, where I basically teach the dog that a really gentle vibration on their neck is a cue to look up and try to find me because I obviously can't call the dog. So there are really clever and interesting applications for these e-collars."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "But they're very divisive in the dog training community for most commonly being used as a go-to punishment. And a downside to that, says Kayla Fratt, is that it can sometimes exacerbate the dog's behavior."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "So a really common example is a lot of trainers will use e-collars in order to punish a dog for behaving aggressively. And what you can do there is you may teach the dog that growling, snarling, snapping, biting is a bad idea, but they might also learn that the approach of a child causes pain, and therefore their aggressive behavior may increase. And eventually there's a chance that that dog could snap and actually go for a bite because the dog is still uncomfortable. The root issue has not been resolved."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "There is, by the way, a third training camp. You might have heard of dominance training, where you show your dog that you're the alpha, the pack leader, sometimes by flipping him over and pinning him on his back. Brianna Dick says new research simply doesn't bear this method out."
    },
    {
      "author": "DICK",
      "text": "We need to be doing something that makes way more sense because it's been debunked. I think if you're a really good trainer, you're going to be learning something new every couple months, if not every year."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "There are a lot of opinions about training methodology, and at the end of the day, you need to listen to your gut and make a decision that feels good to you and to your specific dog."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "Takeaway five is how do you find a good trainer? If what you need is a solid list of positive reinforcement trainers or balance trainers in your area, a good place to start is with lists compiled by the various professional associations. Kayla Fratt, for example, is a member of the IAABC, the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. We'll go more in-depth about some of the others online because there are a bunch, though we'll note that many excellent trainers learned their craft through mentorships and do not belong to professional associations or always have certifications."
    },
    {
      "author": "BALABAN",
      "text": "And then do interviews. Call former clients. See which trainer makes you feel most comfortable. Make sure they can explain their training methods. If you're evaluating balance trainers who advertise their use of e-collars, for example, Kayla Fratt has these questions."
    },
    {
      "author": "FRATT",
      "text": "I would start out by asking the trainer what sorts of skills they ensure that the dog is capable of doing before adding an e-collar. I would also ask them, you know, at what level they're using the e-collar."

If they're focused on, well, don't use that tool, that's an even bigger red flag for me. Do they put an e-collar and prong collar on every dog they work with? That is cookie cutter, and it's never going to garner very good results. You want someone who is getting to know you, your relationship, your lifestyle with your dog."

      "text": "Sometimes a medical problem manifests as a behavioral problem - for example, a dog with a skin rash that is all of a sudden acting very irritated and mean.

You're changing their brain chemistry. But if your dog is experiencing fear, anxiety, panic, aggression, those are not good feelings, and you should treat it like the medical need it is."

      "text": "Hello, LIFE KIT. This is Selena Simmons-Duffin. I'm a health policy reporter at NPR. And my random tip is if you are cooking with kale, you do not need to use a knife to separate the leaves from the stems. You can actually just put your fingers at the stem where the leaf is just starting and slide your fingers up the sides of the stem to immediately strip the leaves away so that you can wash them and cook them up and make something tasty. It's really, really easy."
