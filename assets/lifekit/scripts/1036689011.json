      "text": "This is NPR's LIFE KIT. I'm Andrew Limbong. Like a lot of folks, I started working out a bunch during the pandemic. I'm talking, like, real jock stuff, you know, like swinging and cleaning and pressing hunks of metal. And I started noticing my body change, which was kind of cool. I'd never lifted weights before, so this was new to me. But then I started noticing myself noticing my body more often, you know? Suddenly, the ever-changing glob of skin and bones that I was seeing in the mirror wasn't changing enough to my liking, you know? My traps weren't big enough, my core not toned enough. Turns out, a lot of people were also feeling the same way, according to Ornella Corazza, professor of addictive behavior at the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom."

But the look better comes last, in my opinion, you know? I think the first thing is, you have to feel better. I want people to leave that 6 a.m. class, that 7 a.m. class and be like, dang, I feel really good. Like, I can take my day on. Well, you know, I didn't really want to do that, but I did it. And my endorphins are charging. And I just feel really good about myself. And that's why I'm so passionate about what I do."

I'm selling you that, hey, you're going to be able to play with your kids without getting out of breath, you know, on the weekends. I'm selling you to prepare for life, and not just physically, but it's a mental journey as well. It's an emotional journey as well. And those are skills that can be transferred over to when you walk into your office at work, when you walk into your home, with your relationship with your partner, your spouse, your kids, any of the above."

The ego starts getting involved in, suddenly, the results they've seen over the last three to six months. And suddenly, they're not eating bread anymore. They're not eating rice anymore. They're not eating - and I just think it starts skewing really extreme."

Those just seem part and parcel with it. So how - like, if you have to do those things anyway to hit your goals, how do you know when you're crossing a boundary?"

      "author": "CORAZZA",
      "text": "So I really think that the key question is, who is in control? Are you in control of your life? Or is certain kind of behavior or things controlling you, yes? So for instance, I had an interview a while ago. We were discussing some results about professional athletes. So they need to exercise every day in order to become the No. 1 to get the gold medal. So the question was - so are they all addicted to exercise in this case? - the journalist asked me. And I said, no, you're missing the point. We're talking about professionals. If they want, they can stop doing it, you know? It's not something that they need - is controlling their life. But they are in control of their life. It's their job. It's their activity. So the control is with them and not with the behavior."

Like, I think we all have a certain media literacy to know that, like, I'm never going to get as big as, like, The Rock, right? That's not - I'm like, I have a job. I can't spend all day at the gym, right?"

And it's so look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. It's not going anywhere, you know? It just keeps evolving. I think you have to be self-aware and be able to, at point, say, you know what? Yes. I'm going to engage in some of this. But I'm not going to let it control me. Or I'm going to be aware that - you know what? I need to step back a bit."

      "text": "Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't compare. Don't - please, don't get caught up in the social media. Focus on you. Focus on your self-confidence. Focus on your journey. It goes back, again, to what I just said. Like, we all have different levers, different lengths, different dimensions - all of the above. We all do different things for a living. I don't have any kids. I got a pesky, little dog. You might have four, five kids at home, you know? There's so many variables, so stop comparing. The Rock has a personal chef, for crying out loud, you know, just for example - nothing against The Rock. Love you."

      "text": "You can also, of course, just stop following them. But that's a whole different LIFE KIT episode. So you found your why. And you've been mindful about your emotional and mental needs on top of your physical ones. Next, figure out how to move your body that doesn't feel like a total chore to you. That's our fourth takeaway. Maybe you're into doing circuits or lifting weights. Maybe you hate the idea of going to a gym and would rather hit up a spin class or yoga. Or maybe the idea of exercise for exercise's sake doesn't work for you, so try more recreational stuff like rock climbing or hiking or boxing. Places often offer free trials, so take advantage of them and get a sense of the vibe."

See if it resonates with you. And then, you know what? Go to the zip code over. Go to the next gym, and take their class as well. Do that for the next month. Take four free intro classes. And at the end of the four weeks, make your decision."

So say you want to run that 5K turkey trot without stopping or deadlift your body weight or hit some step number. Figure out when you want to hit that goal by and work backwards from there. And having these small steps can help you motivate towards the bigger picture."

But if you focus on that three-month goal, you'll realize that today is important. It doesn't have to be a big thing. Just go in the general, vague direction of the goal, the three-month goal. And trust me, it will help."

Takeaway 4 - find your how. What kind of exercise do you enjoy? Takeaway 5 - set a goal. It helps to have something concrete to work towards and then work backwards from there."
