It's Marielle. You ever get to the pharmacy to pick up some drug that your doctor says you need, and you wait in the line, surrounded by people who are coughing and sneezing, and you're hungry 'cause you just got out of work, and you're ready to be home already, and then the pharmacist rings up your drug, and it's going to cost - pardon me - how much? See, you expected it to cost 20 bucks, but instead it's 170 or 500 or 1,000."},{"author":"DAN WEISSMANN","text":"And you're like, what? You know, what do I do? What am I supposed to do?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Dan Weissmann is the host of the podcast \"An Arm And A Leg.\""},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"It's a podcast about why health care costs so freaking much and what we can maybe do about it."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Earlier this year, Dan heard a story from Wisconsin about a young guy named Cole Schmidtknecht."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Who had asthma and showed up at his pharmacy one day to get the inhaler that he used to just kind of maintain. And he'd been using it for years, and they were like, OK, that's $500, which he was not expecting. I think he was expecting to pay something like $70. And he just walked away. Like, he had no idea what to do. And within a couple of weeks, he had a big asthma attack and he died."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"His parents filed a lawsuit against the pharmacy and the pharmacy benefits company."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"'Cause they were like, somebody should have told him that, like, this specific medicine, the deal had changed under his insurance and it was no longer covered and it was going to be $500. But there's essentially an equivalent inhaler that he could have walked out with for a price that would not have shocked him. And had somebody told him that, he would be alive today."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"And so as we gathered these stories, I was like, this is essentially the scenario that we're wanting to intervene in. We don't want this to happen to anybody. Everybody should know the questions to ask, the things to try, because in his case, and in a lot of cases, there is something you can do."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Dan and his team have asked their audience to share their experiences, their tricks, their hacks for getting around the high cost of drugs."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"They're all workarounds, right? They're all like, what's a little patch I can put on this extremely broken thing? There's no single direct path to, like, this is the thing you can do, and a lot of times what you're going to do involves a lot of work."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"After talking with lots of people, they ended up with a kind of order of operations, a checklist - what to do when your prescription costs way more than you expected. On this episode of LIFE KIT, I talk to Dan about that list."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK, Dan, let's start at that moment of sticker shock when the pharmacy tells you how much this drug is going to cost you. What is the first step?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"The first thing to do is just be like, wait, really? Like, are you sure? Is there some kind of mistake? Like, this happened to me one time. I went into the pharmacy. I had a prescription for an old-line prescription drug, and the pharmacist was like, that's going to be $400."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And you said, no, no, thank you."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"I said, really? And..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Recalculate, please."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah. And I was like, wait; I think my insurance changed. Do you have my new insurance? And then they were like, actually, under your new insurance, it's $0. So, like, just check for simple errors. Ask, like, could you check with my provider? Is there, like, something misspelled? Is something, you know, easy with the insurance that can be fixed?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"What else can you ask the pharmacist while you're there?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"There can be other questions, like your doctor was like, I want you to take this twice a day, so I'm prescribing you 60 tablets of 5 milligrams. And it turns out the pharmacy wants, like, four times as much for that. And the pharmacy would be like, you know, I could give you 30 10-milligram tablets, and there's a pill cutter over there, and you could, like, solve this. There are just things your doctor may not know about how you're going to be charged for a particular thing. That happens all the time."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"The next question is, like - and you asked the pharmacist first - it's like, hey, is there, like, a discount for this? Is there, like, a coupon you could look for? And, you know, again, I've been - you may have had this experience, too. But some pharmacy I have been to, the pharmacist's like, oh, wait; let me check. I think there's a coupon for this. And they just tell you, oh, yeah, I can give this to you for something much more reasonable. But they may or may not do that. They may or may not be able to check, but you have in your pocket some answers, right? You can basically just open up your phone, go to Google and put in the name of the drug you're there to get and, like, discount or coupon."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"This is wild to me."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"When I first found out - I use them now all the time."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"But when I first..."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...Found out that there were coupons for pharmaceutical drugs..."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...And they can lower the cost significantly, and they're just available online."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Like, you don't have to subscribe or pay to get access to them."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"But it's a if-you-know-you-know thing."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's just there. And there's kind of two flavors, right? I mean, you'll probably - you do the Googling. You'll probably get a result from a site like GoodRx, which people are probably familiar with, and it will tell you, like, there's - actually you could just pay cash for this and this super discounted price."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And we should just say GoodRx has been a sponsor for NPR, but you found out about them through your own reporting, right?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah, exactly. And, yeah, you don't have to sign up for anything. You just, like, click a thing and it shows up on your phone, and there's a code you show to the pharmacist and they're like, great. Here it is for a price you could probably afford. When I showed up at the pharmacy and was told my drug would be $400, I was like, I've heard about this site, GoodRx. And it was pretty interesting because it showed, your pharmacy is asking for $400 for this. If you use our coupon, you could pay $100. And I was like, that still seems like an awful lot. And they're like, Walgreens wants $100 for this, and CVS wants 75. But Mariano's - which is the local grocery chain with a pharmacy in it - they'll sell it to you for 20. Costco - 20 bucks. Walmart - $15."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And this is all that you - what you saw on GoodRx?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"These are discounts that GoodRx has worked out, but it's different at every pharmacy."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"So you mentioned that pharmaceutical companies will often offer coupons as well."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"How do you go about finding those?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"You Google the name of your drug and coupon or discount. That is the most direct way. And if it's there, it's probably going to show up. I mean, GoodRx may have a link to it, also, but they're not hard to find. The manufacturers want them to be easy to find because they want you to use them."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Are there any caveats here when it comes to using coupons?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"The first caveat is, like, not every drug that you would want a coupon for has a coupon you can use. And another one is the coupon may not make it really affordable for you. The coupon may be like, this drug that they're going to charge you $500 for is now just $100 for you. And you may be like, thanks, but $100 is still more than works for me. And then there are parts that are more particular to you. One is you actually have to have insurance for this to work because the strategy on the drug company's part here is they're going to get the insurance company to pay them once they've given you a discount. There's still money left over for them to be paid by the insurance company."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"So if you don't have insurance, there's no point to them giving you this discount. And not all insurance works with it. Specifically, if you have insurance that's basically backed by the federal government, like Medicare or Tricare or the VA, there's what are called anti-kickback laws written that basically mean you can't access these deals. So that's not great."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"And then finally, your insurance company may put up roadblocks, and the basic idea is the insurance company sees the pharmaceutical company's game. They're like, I don't like that, and I'm going to make it so that Dan can't use your coupon. Or if he uses it, he's still got to pay his big deductible. He's still got to lay out tons of money in cash before I start kicking in for this."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Fun."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"It is super, super, super annoying."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"I mean, annoying doesn't cover it, right? There's just no words."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yep. OK. So we tried seeing if there was a mistake."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And then we tried looking for coupons."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"The next step is to ask your provider if they can help."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yes. So we learned about this. We kind of distilled this playbook partly from talking with women (ph) - Jeannie Chamberlain (ph) from North Carolina. So her husband got a prescription. They took it to the pharmacy, and..."},{"author":"JEANNIE CHAMBERLAIN","text":"It was $1,200 for a 14-day supply."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Wow."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"So, you know, she did the first things. She went to Google and she was like, is there a discount here? Is there a coupon here? And Google was like, well, good news, yes, there's a coupon here. But bad news, with the coupon, this $1,200 thing is $800. And Jeannie was like, that's not going to work."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"So onto the next step."},{"author":"CHAMBERLAIN","text":"And so we did what I tell people to do - went back to the doctor and said, is there something else?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"A lot of the time, yeah, there is. You can ask the pharmacist or your doctor, is there an alternative version of this medicine that could work for me? And your pharmacist may say, oh, yeah, right. So this particular asthma inhaler - it's no longer covered by your insurance. It's going to be $500. But there's one made by a competing company that, like, works for most people, and it looks like I could give it to you for, like, 20 bucks, but you want to loop in probably your provider in most cases to say, like, is this other one - is there some reason I shouldn't take this other one? 'Cause sometimes there is. Sometimes your provider's going to be like, well, 'cause you're on this other thing that I've prescribed to you, you probably shouldn't do that one, or, well, I've had bad experience with it. But, like, many, many times..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"...For, you know, medications that are super common, it's just a random quirk that, like, this essentially equivalent medicine is being priced really high for you under your insurance, but this other one - it would be totally available for cheap."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"After the break, we talk about what to do when there is no alternative, and Dan shares more tips."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK, we're back. Dan, what can you do when your doctor says there is no other drug for you to take?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Then you've got a couple of steps to follow. One question is, like, does my insurance just not cover this at all, or are they asking for what's called a prior authorization, meaning they need your doctor or provider to, like, write them and tell them, my patient here needs this specific drug. Here are the medical reasons that other alternatives are not going to work for this patient. I need this one. And your provider should be familiar with that rap and should go ahead and write whatever letter they need to write."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"But that can take time, right? Your doctor may be like, I'm going to write that letter for you, but I'm going to tell you they're going to want 14 days to get this resolved. And you're like, I need this right now. And when you get to the point where it's like, we got to fight with the insurance company, this is where our listeners really came through. And this tip came from a kind of surprising place 'cause the person who called it in is a pharmaceutical sales rep. His name's John (ph). John requested that we use just his first name 'cause he's not authorized to speak to the media about this kind of stuff."},{"author":"JOHN","text":"I love it when I hear stories of average people just sticking it to the insurance company, and it's nice when the patient wins because they don't get a lot of wins."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"I note he said the insurance company, not the pharmaceutical company."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah, that's true. That's true."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"He loves average people sticking it to the other guys. But OK."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"I think of these companies, the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies and the big providers - I think of them all as sharks, and they're each trying to say, like, ah, I hate that shark. That's a bad guy, that shark. But, like, they're all just sharks fighting each other."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And what does that make us - the, like, little minnows?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah, we're the food."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Nice."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"We're it. They're all fighting..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Delicious."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"...Over who gets to eat the most of us. Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Great."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah. It's such an honor to be fought over by these guys. But so what John said was, like, this is actually a place where someone like me can help you. He's like, you know, I carry around samples. I have free samples of things, and this is kind of what they're useful for, right? That, like, your doctor may have on his shelf samples of this thing, that you basically ask your doctor, Doc, do you have or can you get some samples of this medicine for me? Then you have the medicine you need while you and your provider are waging this fight with the insurance company to get your medicine covered."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. So you go to your doctor, you say, got any samples?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Can you give me enough to tide me over for two weeks?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah, or however long it takes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Well, let's say even that doesn't work. Is there anything else, or is this the end of the line?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"No, we're not quite at the end yet because some drug manufacturers also just offer straight-up discounts like financial assistance. They call it patient assistance programs. So these are need-based programs. The pharmaceutical companies offer some of them. Other times, they're offered through nonprofit organizations, and they can make your medicine available for free or at a big discount. So unlike a coupon, you can't just, like, pull it up on your phone. You have to actually fill out an application, and some applications are much more rigorous than others."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"And they all have requirements. They may be like, if you have insurance, we can't help you, or your income is too high, we can't help you. So this is absolutely like a - you have to kind of see if there's something there for you, and they may require your doctor to send in paperwork. And you can search for them individually online. If you search for the name of your drug and patient assistance program, you'll probably get some answers. But if you're looking for multiple drugs or just want a big resource, there's a site called NeedyMeds that brings things together."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"So I'm wondering - a lot of folks are choosing their health insurance plans right now. What should people who take prescription drugs be thinking about as they look over plans?"},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah. The last tip is actually, in some ways, the place to start if you can start early enough. A lot of us don't have a lot of choices when we pick insurance, but we can at least get information about any choices that we do have. There's this super important document that I never heard tell of until I'd been reporting on health care for a minute. It's called the formulary, and the formulary is your insurance plan's list of all the drugs - all the drugs - and how much you will pay for any given drug. So during open enrollment is when you got to find that formulary for any plan you're looking at. So if you're shopping on HealthCare.gov or your state's Affordable Care Act marketplace site, you can find it there online. I mean, you might have to hunt around a little bit. If you're getting this from HR, you ask, like, I need to see the formulary for next year's insurance plans."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"And then you - if you're lucky, you know, you get it in electronic form, and you hit Ctrl-F - right? - find - for the drugs that you need to take. And that's where it tells you, this is what your medicines are going to cost you next year under this plan. This is also the time when, if you're like, no plan that's being offered to me has my meds at the prices that are right for me, now you have a head-start, right? It's the fall. The year hasn't started yet, and this is when you go to your provider and you're like, hey, what are alternatives? They say this drug for my condition isn't covered, but this other one is. Can I take that one? And if your doctor's like, no, you're like, great. Let's start that process now of hitting the appeals, hitting the prior authorizations so that when it's January 1, we've sorted it out."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good tip."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Yeah, it's - I mean, it's like the super pro tip. And, you know, the sad part is that it's a thing you have to do every year, right? Like, you solved it for this year, your insurance, your setup. You're on a plan that covers what you need, or you fought the battle to get it covered. And then next year, you know, your work is like, yeah, we changed insurance plans. You're like, OK, what's the formulary this time? And now I got to start fighting again. Or if you're on Medicare and the drug benefit there, it's called Part D. Those plans are all administered by private insurance companies and a lot of them change every year - like, change the formulary. So Jeannie, who we talked to at the beginning, she's working with seniors who, every year, she's like, let's look at that formulary. And if they didn't do that with her, they'll come to her in January, and they'll be like, I don't know why my medicine is $300 now."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"It's exhausting. I need a nap after thinking about all this."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"You and me both, man."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Dan Weissmann, thank you so much."},{"author":"WEISSMANN","text":"Marielle, thanks so much for having me."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That was Dan Weissmann, host of the show \"An Arm And A Leg,\" a podcast about why health care costs so freaking much and what we can maybe do about it."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right, time for a recap. Takeaway one - if you're picking up a prescription and it costs more than you expected, first find out if there's been a mistake, like maybe the pharmacy doesn't have your insurance information or input it wrong. Takeaway two - ask your pharmacist for coupons or discounts, and also look for them online. Takeaway three - ask if there are any alternative drugs that you could take. And if not, see if they'll write a letter of medical necessity to your insurance company to get them to cover this drug. Takeaway four - that process can take a while. So in the meantime, find out if your doctor's office has any free samples of the drug that can tide you over."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway five - look into financial assistance programs. Some drug manufacturers offer these based on financial need, and nonprofit groups sometimes offer these, too. One site that can help you navigate your options is called NeedyMeds."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And takeaway six - before you choose your health insurance plan for next year, ask to see the formulary for each plan you're considering. That'll show you all the drugs your insurance covers and how much you'll pay for each one. This could help you make decisions about a plan or help you get a letter of medical necessity from your doctor before the new plan year starts."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Before we go, I have a favor to ask. If you have a second, would you leave LIFE KIT a five-star review? If LIFE KIT has ever helped you save a little money, make a healthier choice for yourself or made you feel more seen, a five-star review is a great way to show your support.

And you may be like, thanks, but $100 is still more than works for me. And then there are parts that are more particular to you. One is you actually have to have insurance for this to work because the strategy on the drug company's part here is they're going to get the insurance company to pay them once they've given you a discount. There's still money left over for them to be paid by the insurance company."]},{"begin":"532.840","end":"555.720","lines":["So if you don't have insurance, there's no point to them giving you this discount.

Here are the medical reasons that other alternatives are not going to work for this patient. I need this one.

That, like, your doctor may have on his shelf samples of this thing, that you basically ask your doctor, Doc, do you have or can you get some samples of this medicine for me?

Other times, they're offered through nonprofit organizations, and they can make your medicine available for free or at a big discount.

If you search for the name of your drug and patient assistance program, you'll probably get some answers. But if you're looking for multiple drugs or just want a big resource, there's a site called NeedyMeds that brings things together."]},{"begin":"1057.440","end":"1067.080","lines":["So I'm wondering - a lot of folks are choosing their health insurance plans right now. What should people who take prescription drugs be thinking about as they look over plans?"]},{"begin":"1067.080","end":"1118.680","lines":["Yeah. The last tip is actually, in some ways, the place to start if you can start early enough. A lot of us don't have a lot of choices when we pick insurance, but we can at least get information about any choices that we do have. There's this super important document that I never heard tell of until I'd been reporting on health care for a minute. It's called the formulary, and the formulary is your insurance plan's list of all the drugs - all the drugs - and how much you will pay for any given drug. So during open enrollment is when you got to find that formulary for any plan you're looking at. So if you're shopping on HealthCare.gov or your state's Affordable Care Act marketplace site, you can find it there online. I mean, you might have to hunt around a little bit. If you're getting this from HR, you ask, like, I need to see the formulary for next year's insurance plans."]},{"begin":"1118.680","end":"1167.960","lines":["And then you - if you're lucky, you know, you get it in electronic form, and you hit Ctrl-F - right? - find - for the drugs that you need to take. And that's where it tells you, this is what your medicines are going to cost you next year under this plan. This is also the time when, if you're like, no plan that's being offered to me has my meds at the prices that are right for me, now you have a head-start, right? It's the fall. The year hasn't started yet, and this is when you go to your provider and you're like, hey, what are alternatives? They say this drug for my condition isn't covered, but this other one is. Can I take that one? And if your doctor's like, no, you're like, great. Let's start that process now of hitting the appeals, hitting the prior authorizations so that when it's January 1, we've sorted it out."]},{"begin":"1167.960","end":"1170.760","lines":["Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good tip."]},{"begin":"1170.760","end":"1221.040","lines":["Yeah, it's - I mean, it's like the super pro tip. And, you know, the sad part is that it's a thing you have to do every year, right? Like, you solved it for this year, your insurance, your setup. You're on a plan that covers what you need, or you fought the battle to get it covered. And then next year, you know, your work is like, yeah, we changed insurance plans. You're like, OK, what's the formulary this time? And now I got to start fighting again. Or if you're on Medicare and the drug benefit there, it's called Part D. Those plans are all administered by private insurance companies and a lot of them change every year - like, change the formulary. So Jeannie, who we talked to at the beginning, she's working with seniors who, every year, she's like, let's look at that formulary. And if they didn't do that with her, they'll come to her in January, and they'll be like, I don't know why my medicine is $300 now."]},{"begin":"1221.040","end":"1225.440","lines":["It's exhausting.

Takeaway one - if you're picking up a prescription and it costs more than you expected, first find out if there's been a mistake, like maybe the pharmacy doesn't have your insurance information or input it wrong. Takeaway two - ask your pharmacist for coupons or discounts, and also look for them online. Takeaway three - ask if there are any alternative drugs that you could take. And if not, see if they'll write a letter of medical necessity to your insurance company to get them to cover this drug. Takeaway four - that process can take a while. So in the meantime, find out if your doctor's office has any free samples of the drug that can tide you over."]},{"begin":"1282.240","end":"1295.680","lines":["Takeaway five - look into financial assistance programs.
