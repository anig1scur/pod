It's Marielle. Before we get to the show, I want to make sure you know it's a special day for NPR 'cause it's GivingTuesday. NPR celebrates this global day of generosity every year, but we've never had a year quite like this one. You've probably heard by now that federal funding for public media was eliminated as of October 1. That means NPR is now operating without federal support for the first time ever. It's a big change and a big challenge, but it's one that we can overcome together. We are so grateful for the listeners who've already stepped up to donate, like Stephanie (ph) from Kansas, who says, I frequently listen to LIFE KIT to jump-start my morning. Everything I learn helps me practice productive habits. Stephanie, we are so glad to hear it."},{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"Please make your GivingTuesday gift right now by signing up for NPR+. It's a simple recurring donation that gets you perks, like bonus episodes of NPR podcasts and curated collections of LIFE KIT episodes by topic, like health and parenting. Join us at plus.npr.org. Thanks again for your support, and thank you if you're already an NPR+ supporter. All right. Let's get on to the show."},{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"You're listening to LIFE KIT..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...From NPR."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"I remember when I interviewed for my very first full-time journalism job at a corporate finance magazine. I actually tried to talk my future boss out of hiring me. I told her, look, finance isn't my thing. I was an English major. I don't know anything about this. She told me I could learn. And that was true."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Over the years, I learned about accounting and taxes, city finances, macroeconomics, the Federal Reserve. I became fluent in a lot of these things. But I think it's worth noting that I felt like finance as a topic was just not accessible to me. Mary Childs felt like this, too."},{"author":"MARY CHILDS, BYLINE","text":"When I started out as a journalist covering this, I was mystified by it. And you start to just sort of rhythmically understand that there's, like, capital flows - that just means money moving - and, like, different asset classes. That's just stuff you can buy. All this different terminology that, like, becomes second nature, but it can feel really foreign."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Mary is a longtime financial journalist and a co-host of the NPR show Planet Money. Anyway, I think this is how a lot of us feel, journalist or not, especially when it comes to investing - mystified, intimidated, ill equipped. But we can't let that stop us from trying 'cause the truth is you can learn and you should."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"The stock market can allow you to generate more money than if you just saved your money in a savings account or invested it in safer assets, like bonds, and to kind of participate in broader economic growth. So as the economy around you is growing and more transactions are happening and businesses are growing, stocks are going to be going up, and you want to be a part of that. You don't want to get left behind."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"On this episode of LIFE KIT, Investing 101. We'll talk about different types of retirement plans and their tax benefits, the various kinds of investment funds and how to diversify. And we'll also get into brokerage accounts, which you can use to invest for the shorter term."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"A lot of people invest through a company-sponsored retirement plan, like a 401(k) or a 403(b). Can you just explain what those are?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Those are both simply vehicles that have been created by legislation to have tax benefits to kind of allow employees to invest with a little bit of a boost from the tax regime. So a 401(k) is typically for employees of for-profit corporations, and a 403(b) is for employees of public education organizations and some tax-exempt nonprofits. And they let employees contribute money before paying taxes. So you get to defer your taxes until you start withdrawing - at the latest age 73, when you're retired. And hopefully, at that point, your pile of money is so much bigger because you have been investing in this plan this whole time."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"I can't give investment advice, but this is so huge. If your employer offers a match program, like, that's free money, and you should take it. And you should just ring every dollar you can afford to put into your 401(k) and get matched because that's just going to benefit you later."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Yeah, I think this is how a lot of folks are introduced to investing. Just to go through some of the basics, what happens to a retirement plan when you leave a job?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"It just continues. So it will stay as you left it. It's, like, frozen in time, but it's just chugging along, still being invested in the market. And so you got a new job, say, and they have a 401(k) plan or a 403(b), and you can actually combine them. So there are all these, like, buttons you can push at Vanguard or Fidelity or whatever to roll your old retirement account into your new one. And it's pretty easy, I think."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"What are some other ways, besides these company-sponsored plans, that people can invest for retirement?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah. There are a bunch of different options. There's a Roth IRA, and there's a regular IRA. Basically, it just games when you pay taxes. Are you going to pay taxes today and then put all your money in it and never have to pay taxes again on it when you withdraw, when it's, like, you know, compounded annually for the past 30 years, and it's a bajillion dollars now? Congratulations. Or do you want to pay taxes at the end when you have a bajillion dollars?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right. Takeaway one - there are several different kinds of retirement investment accounts. You might be able to start one through your job. This is known as a 401(k) at a for-profit company or a 403(b) at a nonprofit. And there's a tax benefit to these. You don't have to pay taxes on your contributions or on your earnings until you start withdrawing the money, generally when you retire, which could be great if you expect your tax rate to be lower at that point. Also, your employer might offer you a match, meaning if you put in, say, 3% of your salary, they will also put the equivalent amount of money into your account. That's free money, so take advantage of it."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"You can also start an individual retirement account, or IRA. Often folks will have these if they're self-employed or if they want to roll over money from a company that they've left. Then there's an option called a Roth, and these can be individual retirement accounts, or they can be employer sponsored. The main difference is in how you pay taxes. With a Roth, you can invest money that's already been taxed, and then you don't have to pay any taxes on the gains at any point. And you can withdraw your contributions at any time, even before retirement, without paying a penalty, which is not true for traditional retirement accounts."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"One thing I've heard is that it can help if you have the ability to invest in both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA or 401(k) or 403(b)."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Because the tax benefits are different and so you're sort of hedging your bets there."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. So let's say that your company does offer a retirement plan. Step 1 would be to tell your company to withhold a certain amount from your paychecks - right? - before you pay taxes and put it in that retirement account. But after you do that, you have to choose the stocks and funds to invest in, right?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Uh-huh."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Does that ever get done automatically?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"It actually can. The, like, automatic stuff is generally because it's really important that people do invest in these, that employees do get their retirements up and running to some degree. And employers know that and have set up a bunch of nudges to make that happen. 'Cause this decision can be really hard, and it's really overwhelming. And you're like, why do I know if the Vanguard index fund is better or worse than the BlackRock target date fund? Like, how am I supposed to - like, this is just a list of gibberish."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Yeah. I think this is where a lot of people get tripped up because there are so many options, different fund names with different acronyms."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Completely."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Let's walk through some common terms that you might see when you're starting to invest in funds. What is an index fund?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah. So an index fund is just a basket of whatever thing you have chosen - stocks or bonds - that aims to track an index, like the S&P 500. An index fund simply tracks that index and doesn't necessarily make any decisions about, like, oh, you know, I no longer like the look of Microsoft or Facebook, and I shall sell them. No. The decisions are made automatically based on what the index has and what proportion of each stock is in that index."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Now, here's the Russian doll question within the question. What is the S&P 500?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"I love that. It's just the 500 biggest or most important companies that are listed on a stock exchange in the United States. So it's just the broad market. It's kind of used as the benchmark that we all look to as to say, OK, how are stocks, broadly speaking, doing today or doing over time?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. In comparison to an index fund, there are also funds that are actively managed by somebody, right?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"That's exactly right. So there are funds that have a person at the helm who is making buying and selling choices daily because they made some judgment. They exercised some discretion, and they made a choice. And that will not happen in a passively managed fund."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Another set of terms that people might see are mutual fund and ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Can you explain the difference between those?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"A mutual fund is, like, a pooled investment vehicle. You know, if I go out to buy a slice of an index, or I go out to buy a slice of a company, a piece of stock, I don't have that much money. But if you and I pool our money and we pull in all of our friends, suddenly we have a lot more purchasing power, right? We can buy more. A mutual fund is just a pooled investment vehicle for a lot of different investors to be able kind of buy into this same portfolio that they each get a little slice of."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. And then what's an ETF?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"So an ETF - that stands for exchange-traded fund - the product itself is traded on an exchange, like, just like a stock. And the reason people really like it is that they are tax advantaged. They have a lot of tax benefits that make them a lot more attractive than, say, a mutual fund or other types of products that you might be able to buy."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Do ETFs also tend to have lower fees?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yes. Because of that tax advantage, ETFs are able to charge less money for their execution, and they are able to charge less because they're generally passively managed. They are mostly index funds. Mutual funds are almost always actively managed, managed by a person making decisions, a person who needs to be paid a salary. There are actively managed ETFs, but the general idea that we're talking about is probably going to be an index fund. No one's there making decisions. It's just an automatic thing. It can be executed basically automatically, and that can get pretty cheap."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right. Takeaway two - here are some common terms you might see when you're starting to invest. An index fund is a type of investment fund that goes up and down in value according to the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq. And a market index is basically a collection of companies. The S&P 500, for instance, includes 500 large U.S. companies. Index funds are passively managed, so there's nobody at the helm making decisions about what stocks to buy and sell every day. The fund just follows the index, however that's doing."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And then there are funds that are actively managed. Somebody's deciding what to buy and sell based on conditions in the economy in the world. Mutual funds are generally actively managed, and they have higher fees because of that. But they don't necessarily perform better than index funds. ETF, or exchange-traded funds, are typically passively managed and have lower fees. And you do want to minimize the fees you pay because those can really add up over time."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"So I know there are a lot of funds out there, and you could probably make a case for any individual one. But which of these tend to perform better over time?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"I think the general consensus is that for individual investors - people like you and me, who are not spending all of our time researching companies and getting an edge on our competition and finding out what companies are going to outperform in the future - people like us are often best situated by just buying an index fund. Like, we're not going to beat the market. We don't have an edge. No offense to us. It's OK. We're doing other things."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Is it a reasonable choice to just put all of your money in your retirement account in one index fund that tracks the S&P 500?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"I would maybe put some in bonds. You know, just try to jazz it up a little bit so that all my eggs are not in one literal basket. But, well, it's probably fine (laughter)."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. So, I mean, let's talk about what it means to have a diversified portfolio. Like, why do people say that you should diversify, and what does that actually mean?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"The idea of a diversified portfolio is just the idea that a basket of things with different risks, those risks can balance each other out. So, like, the stock market might have a really terrible day one day, but bonds often go up in price when stocks go down. So if you're all in on the stock market, you're going to lose money. If you're balanced between the stock market and the bond market, you're going to lose a little less money than you would have in the initial scenario, just as a simple example."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Well, let's talk about bonds because this is a common way that people try to not put all their eggs in one basket, as you said."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"What are bonds, and why do people invest in them as part of a retirement plan?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah. So when a company borrows money, they are issuing a bond. And that's just a promise that they will pay back that money they borrowed plus periodic interest payments for a given amount of time. And you - as the investor, you are lending out your money, and in return, you get those interest payments. And that's the kind of compensation you get for taking the risk of lending to the company. And the riskier the perception of the company, the higher that yield will be, the higher that compensation. And bonds are safer because they are higher in a company's list of corporate promises than stocks. So ostensibly, unless the company goes bankrupt, you're going to get that money back plus interest. And that's kind of the comforting promise of bonds versus the risk of stocks that, you know, your money can just kind of totally evaporate."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"How do bonds tend to perform compared to, say, a high-yield savings account?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Oh, great question. So a high-yield savings account, when interest rates are high, they yield more, right? So they track how much - where the Fed is setting interest rates. And as a result, you as an investor can get money just for saving, which is amazing. And bonds are supposed to perform better than that. So because you're taking the risk of lending to a company, a company which is going to then go and do business that you aren't managing - right? - that is a risk, and you're being compensated for that risk with the interest payments. And so the interest you're getting on your savings is literally just the bank saying, thank you so much for your business. I appreciate having this cash so that I can lend it out versus when you buy a bond, you're making the choice to lend to that company and take on that risk. So it's just sort of a question of who's managing it and what risk you're getting paid for."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"If I wanted to diversify my portfolio or not put all my eggs in one basket, however we want to say it, what percentage of my money should be in bonds? Like, what do people recommend?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"The traditional recommendation, the generic recommendation, which doesn't take into account who you are as an investor, that is for a 60-40 allocation portfolio. So that's for 60% stocks, 40% bonds. And that means you're taking some risk. You're a little bit tilted toward risk, but you are not risking it all."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway three - in general, it's a good idea to diversify your retirement portfolio and to not just hold stocks. A common way to do this is to buy bonds. They often perform well when stocks go down. So if you have these in the mix, the market downturns won't hit you as hard. That said, bonds don't pay the same high returns that you can get from stock funds. So if you want the opportunity to make the most money possible and you have a long time horizon, you might choose to not have bonds or to have a very small amount."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Does that change if you're 22 years old or..."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Oh, yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...30 years old or, you know, you don't necessarily need to have these really safe investments if you have the benefit of lots and lots of time?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yes. One thing that I think cannot be underscored enough is the benefit of time. So if you're younger, you can afford to lose money, basically. You can still generate more money by working. You're going to be able to recover to kind of fill in any holes if the stock market is to go down. And also, if you stay invested and you don't sell, which we know you're not supposed to sell, the stock market generally comes back. That means that your portfolio will bounce back. Just don't look at your portfolio. Don't open the website 'cause it's going to look really ugly. You're going to be tempted to sell and that's a mistake."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"And then as you get older, you want to make reevaluations. You want to kind of take a step back and say, OK, what do I need to save and what do I need to have for sure in order to have a comfortable retirement, in order to be able to make my rent or mortgage payments and afford food and afford whatever my lifestyle is?  And that means that your priorities turn from generating money to protecting your money. And so that means you want to go from a riskier something or other, like stocks, to a safer something or other, like bonds."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"We'll have more investing basics with Mary Childs of Planet Money after the break."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"What if you don't want to invest in funds that support certain industries, like, for ethical reasons? Are you sacrificing performance?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Oh, this is such a good question. It is a hard one. You can slice it every which way, and you can find a study that will support your biases - whatever thesis you have might be. But studies have shown that ethical investing or environmental, social and governance funds - funds that focus on doing better by those metrics - have performed at least as well as traditional portfolios. There is a case to be made for investing in funds that will engage with management and say, hey, we, as your shareholders - I own this much percent, and I'm concerned about your use of this or the number of worker injuries or fatalities in production. All of these different metrics that you as an investor can actually say, hey, we care about this thing. Can you do better? Can you fix it? And the company has to listen because you are a part owner of that company."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"These funds would generally - they would have to be actively managed, right?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yes and no. It, again, depends on what you want. There are plenty of products that are passively managed, that are their own kind of indices, that are like, OK, we are the S&P 500 but minus fossil fuels, or there are a bunch of different options that are like that."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. That's good to know. We've been talking about retirement investments mainly, but there are other ways to invest for the shorter term, and a big one is to put money in a brokerage account. Can you just explain what is a brokerage account, and how is it different from, like, let's say, a 401(k)?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yeah. So a brokerage account is just a little place for you to put your own money that is not pooled with someone else's money, and you can just invest directly in the market that way. So you would open, you know, a Schwab account or something like that, and you would have your own little pile of money. And you would buy a fraction of a share or a share of a smaller company and participate directly in the stock market or bond market that way. And you can still buy into ETFs and mutual funds that way as well, but there's less of a tax benefit, and there's - you're obviously not getting your beautiful employee match."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"The thing is that if you're putting money in a brokerage account, it's not as long of a horizon."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Exactly. So this is money you can access at any time. You don't have to wait until you're retiring, as you would in your 401(k) or 403(b) account."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"So given that, like, if you know, all right, like, I've had this money in a brokerage account for a few years. It's been growing. I want to buy a house in one year. Do you shift your investments in that account to a fund that seems less risky, or do you up the percentage that you have invested in bonds?"},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Everything is relative. So, you're - you know, you have to look at the landscape around us and what the market's been doing and what other people expect and how they feel. And this is, of course, where it gets really hard because no one has a crystal ball. But the idea is like, OK, if you think that we're in an AI bubble and there's a crash coming in the next three to six months, don't put your money in the stock market. You're going to then go put your money in a bond fund or real estate or something else that separates you from the AI crash that you think is necessarily coming. And then you may not make 10% of what you invested in, but you're not going to lose the 30% that you think is coming, right?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Right."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"So it's that kind of relative value judgment that, you know, anytime you say something is cheap, there's an implied compared to what? Anytime something's expensive, compared to what?"},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Takeaway four - in this episode, we've mostly talked about retirement accounts, but there are also ways to invest for the shorter term. One way is to open up a brokerage account, and you might have a different strategy for the investments in this account than in your retirement plan because you're looking at a shorter time horizon."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"I think it's helpful to remember that there isn't one right way to go about this."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"There's no one right answer, yeah."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And nobody knows, but we have some general guidelines that have seen success over time."},{"author":"CHILDS","text":"Yes. There are things that we can learn from research and from history, and that can help insulate us from mistakes."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"One other note here - don't hold your emergency savings in a brokerage account. You want to put those in an FDIC-insured, high-yield savings account where they won't fluctuate with the stock market."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"OK. Time for a recap. Takeaway one - there are several different kinds of retirement investment accounts with varying tax benefits - 401(k)s, 403(b)s, IRAs - and there are Roth versions of all of these. Also, if your employer offers a retirement plan match, take advantage of that."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway two - an index fund is a type of passively managed investment fund that goes up and down in value according to the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq. And then there are funds that are actively managed, meaning somebody's deciding what to buy and sell based on conditions in the economy and in the world. Mutual funds are generally actively managed and have higher fees because of it, but they don't necessarily perform better than index funds. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are typically passively managed and have lower fees, and you do want to minimize the fees you pay."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Takeaway three - a common way to diversify is to buy bonds. They often perform well when stocks go down. So if you have them in the mix, market downturns won't hit you as hard. But bonds don't pay the same high returns that you could get from stock funds. So if you want to give yourself the opportunity to make the most money possible and you have a long time horizon, you might choose not to hold bonds at all or to hold a very small amount."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"And takeaway four - once you have your emergency savings in an FDIC-insured bank account, consider a brokerage account to grow money that you'll want to access before retirement. By the way, you may have a different strategy for the investments in this account than the ones in your retirement plan because you're looking at a shorter time horizon."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"All right.

Can you just explain what those are?"]},{"begin":"262.520","end":"325.520","lines":["Those are both simply vehicles that have been created by legislation to have tax benefits to kind of allow employees to invest with a little bit of a boost from the tax regime. So a 401(k) is typically for employees of for-profit corporations, and a 403(b) is for employees of public education organizations and some tax-exempt nonprofits. And they let employees contribute money before paying taxes. So you get to defer your taxes until you start withdrawing - at the latest age 73, when you're retired. And hopefully, at that point, your pile of money is so much bigger because you have been investing in this plan this whole time."]},{"begin":"325.520","end":"354.720","lines":["I can't give investment advice, but this is so huge. If your employer offers a match program, like, that's free money, and you should take it.

So there are all these, like, buttons you can push at Vanguard or Fidelity or whatever to roll your old retirement account into your new one. And it's pretty easy, I think."]},{"begin":"411.600","end":"418.400","lines":["What are some other ways, besides these company-sponsored plans, that people can invest for retirement?"]},{"begin":"418.400","end":"443.040","lines":["Yeah. There are a bunch of different options. There's a Roth IRA, and there's a regular IRA. Basically, it just games when you pay taxes. Are you going to pay taxes today and then put all your money in it and never have to pay taxes again on it when you withdraw, when it's, like, you know, compounded annually for the past 30 years, and it's a bajillion dollars now? Congratulations. Or do you want to pay taxes at the end when you have a bajillion dollars?"]},{"begin":"443.040","end":"482.760","lines":["All right. Takeaway one - there are several different kinds of retirement investment accounts. You might be able to start one through your job. This is known as a 401(k) at a for-profit company or a 403(b) at a nonprofit. And there's a tax benefit to these. You don't have to pay taxes on your contributions or on your earnings until you start withdrawing the money, generally when you retire, which could be great if you expect your tax rate to be lower at that point. Also, your employer might offer you a match, meaning if you put in, say, 3% of your salary, they will also put the equivalent amount of money into your account. That's free money, so take advantage of it."]},{"begin":"482.760","end":"517.040","lines":["You can also start an individual retirement account, or IRA. Often folks will have these if they're self-employed or if they want to roll over money from a company that they've left. Then there's an option called a Roth, and these can be individual retirement accounts, or they can be employer sponsored. The main difference is in how you pay taxes. With a Roth, you can invest money that's already been taxed, and then you don't have to pay any taxes on the gains at any point. And you can withdraw your contributions at any time, even before retirement, without paying a penalty, which is not true for traditional retirement accounts."]},{"begin":"517.040","end":"532.200","lines":["One thing I've heard is that it can help if you have the ability to invest in both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA or 401(k) or 403(b)."]},{"begin":"532.200","end":"532.640","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"532.640","end":"536.480","lines":["Because the tax benefits are different and so you're sort of hedging your bets there."]},{"begin":"536.480","end":"537.200","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"537.200","end":"554.400","lines":["OK. So let's say that your company does offer a retirement plan. Step 1 would be to tell your company to withhold a certain amount from your paychecks - right? - before you pay taxes and put it in that retirement account.

Does that ever get done automatically?"]},{"begin":"557.560","end":"585.320","lines":["It actually can. The, like, automatic stuff is generally because it's really important that people do invest in these, that employees do get their retirements up and running to some degree. And employers know that and have set up a bunch of nudges to make that happen. 'Cause this decision can be really hard, and it's really overwhelming. And you're like, why do I know if the Vanguard index fund is better or worse than the BlackRock target date fund? Like, how am I supposed to - like, this is just a list of gibberish."]},{"begin":"585.320","end":"591.680","lines":["Yeah.

What is an index fund?"]},{"begin":"600.200","end":"631.240","lines":["Yeah. So an index fund is just a basket of whatever thing you have chosen - stocks or bonds - that aims to track an index, like the S&P 500. An index fund simply tracks that index and doesn't necessarily make any decisions about, like, oh, you know, I no longer like the look of Microsoft or Facebook, and I shall sell them. No. The decisions are made automatically based on what the index has and what proportion of each stock is in that index."]},{"begin":"631.240","end":"636.080","lines":["Now, here's the Russian doll question within the question. What is the S&P 500?"]},{"begin":"636.080","end":"654.560","lines":["I love that. It's just the 500 biggest or most important companies that are listed on a stock exchange in the United States. So it's just the broad market. It's kind of used as the benchmark that we all look to as to say, OK, how are stocks, broadly speaking, doing today or doing over time?"]},{"begin":"654.560","end":"661.840","lines":["OK. In comparison to an index fund, there are also funds that are actively managed by somebody, right?"]},{"begin":"661.840","end":"677.080","lines":["That's exactly right. So there are funds that have a person at the helm who is making buying and selling choices daily because they made some judgment. They exercised some discretion, and they made a choice. And that will not happen in a passively managed fund."]},{"begin":"677.080","end":"685.840","lines":["OK. Another set of terms that people might see are mutual fund and ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Can you explain the difference between those?"]},{"begin":"685.840","end":"714.400","lines":["A mutual fund is, like, a pooled investment vehicle. You know, if I go out to buy a slice of an index, or I go out to buy a slice of a company, a piece of stock, I don't have that much money. But if you and I pool our money and we pull in all of our friends, suddenly we have a lot more purchasing power, right? We can buy more. A mutual fund is just a pooled investment vehicle for a lot of different investors to be able kind of buy into this same portfolio that they each get a little slice of."]},{"begin":"714.400","end":"716.320","lines":["OK. And then what's an ETF?"]},{"begin":"716.320","end":"734.920","lines":["So an ETF - that stands for exchange-traded fund - the product itself is traded on an exchange, like, just like a stock. And the reason people really like it is that they are tax advantaged. They have a lot of tax benefits that make them a lot more attractive than, say, a mutual fund or other types of products that you might be able to buy."]},{"begin":"734.920","end":"738.320","lines":["Do ETFs also tend to have lower fees?"]},{"begin":"738.320","end":"771.160","lines":["Yes. Because of that tax advantage, ETFs are able to charge less money for their execution, and they are able to charge less because they're generally passively managed. They are mostly index funds. Mutual funds are almost always actively managed, managed by a person making decisions, a person who needs to be paid a salary. There are actively managed ETFs, but the general idea that we're talking about is probably going to be an index fund. No one's there making decisions. It's just an automatic thing. It can be executed basically automatically, and that can get pretty cheap."]},{"begin":"771.160","end":"806.040","lines":["All right. Takeaway two - here are some common terms you might see when you're starting to invest. An index fund is a type of investment fund that goes up and down in value according to the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq. And a market index is basically a collection of companies. The S&P 500, for instance, includes 500 large U.S. companies. Index funds are passively managed, so there's nobody at the helm making decisions about what stocks to buy and sell every day. The fund just follows the index, however that's doing."]},{"begin":"806.040","end":"831.520","lines":["And then there are funds that are actively managed. Somebody's deciding what to buy and sell based on conditions in the economy in the world. Mutual funds are generally actively managed, and they have higher fees because of that. But they don't necessarily perform better than index funds. ETF, or exchange-traded funds, are typically passively managed and have lower fees. And you do want to minimize the fees you pay because those can really add up over time."]},{"begin":"831.520","end":"844.880","lines":["So I know there are a lot of funds out there, and you could probably make a case for any individual one.

Like, we're not going to beat the market. We don't have an edge. No offense to us. It's OK. We're doing other things."]},{"begin":"866.920","end":"874.960","lines":["Is it a reasonable choice to just put all of your money in your retirement account in one index fund that tracks the S&P 500?"]},{"begin":"874.960","end":"885.280","lines":["I would maybe put some in bonds. You know, just try to jazz it up a little bit so that all my eggs are not in one literal basket. But, well, it's probably fine (laughter)."]},{"begin":"885.280","end":"896.200","lines":["OK. So, I mean, let's talk about what it means to have a diversified portfolio. Like, why do people say that you should diversify, and what does that actually mean?"]},{"begin":"896.200","end":"922.200","lines":["The idea of a diversified portfolio is just the idea that a basket of things with different risks, those risks can balance each other out. So, like, the stock market might have a really terrible day one day, but bonds often go up in price when stocks go down. So if you're all in on the stock market, you're going to lose money. If you're balanced between the stock market and the bond market, you're going to lose a little less money than you would have in the initial scenario, just as a simple example."]},{"begin":"922.200","end":"930.680","lines":["OK. Well, let's talk about bonds because this is a common way that people try to not put all their eggs in one basket, as you said."]},{"begin":"930.680","end":"931.320","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"931.320","end":"935.920","lines":["What are bonds, and why do people invest in them as part of a retirement plan?"]},{"begin":"935.920","end":"980.560","lines":["Yeah. So when a company borrows money, they are issuing a bond. And that's just a promise that they will pay back that money they borrowed plus periodic interest payments for a given amount of time. And you - as the investor, you are lending out your money, and in return, you get those interest payments. And that's the kind of compensation you get for taking the risk of lending to the company. And the riskier the perception of the company, the higher that yield will be, the higher that compensation. And bonds are safer because they are higher in a company's list of corporate promises than stocks. So ostensibly, unless the company goes bankrupt, you're going to get that money back plus interest. And that's kind of the comforting promise of bonds versus the risk of stocks that, you know, your money can just kind of totally evaporate."]},{"begin":"980.560","end":"985.880","lines":["How do bonds tend to perform compared to, say, a high-yield savings account?"]},{"begin":"985.880","end":"1044.280","lines":["Oh, great question. So a high-yield savings account, when interest rates are high, they yield more, right? So they track how much - where the Fed is setting interest rates. And as a result, you as an investor can get money just for saving, which is amazing. And bonds are supposed to perform better than that. So because you're taking the risk of lending to a company, a company which is going to then go and do business that you aren't managing - right? - that is a risk, and you're being compensated for that risk with the interest payments. And so the interest you're getting on your savings is literally just the bank saying, thank you so much for your business. I appreciate having this cash so that I can lend it out versus when you buy a bond, you're making the choice to lend to that company and take on that risk. So it's just sort of a question of who's managing it and what risk you're getting paid for."]},{"begin":"1044.280","end":"1057.960","lines":["If I wanted to diversify my portfolio or not put all my eggs in one basket, however we want to say it, what percentage of my money should be in bonds? Like, what do people recommend?"]},{"begin":"1057.960","end":"1085.880","lines":["The traditional recommendation, the generic recommendation, which doesn't take into account who you are as an investor, that is for a 60-40 allocation portfolio. So that's for 60% stocks, 40% bonds. And that means you're taking some risk. You're a little bit tilted toward risk, but you are not risking it all."]},{"begin":"1085.880","end":"1137.200","lines":["Takeaway three - in general, it's a good idea to diversify your retirement portfolio and to not just hold stocks. A common way to do this is to buy bonds. They often perform well when stocks go down. So if you have these in the mix, the market downturns won't hit you as hard. That said, bonds don't pay the same high returns that you can get from stock funds. So if you want the opportunity to make the most money possible and you have a long time horizon, you might choose to not have bonds or to have a very small amount."]},{"begin":"1137.200","end":"1143.680","lines":["Does that change if you're 22 years old or..."]},{"begin":"1143.680","end":"1145.440","lines":["Oh, yeah."]},{"begin":"1145.440","end":"1160.400","lines":["...30 years old or, you know, you don't necessarily need to have these really safe investments if you have the benefit of lots and lots of time?"]},{"begin":"1160.400","end":"1228.440","lines":["Yes. One thing that I think cannot be underscored enough is the benefit of time. So if you're younger, you can afford to lose money, basically. You can still generate more money by working. You're going to be able to recover to kind of fill in any holes if the stock market is to go down. And also, if you stay invested and you don't sell, which we know you're not supposed to sell, the stock market generally comes back. That means that your portfolio will bounce back. Just don't look at your portfolio. Don't open the website 'cause it's going to look really ugly. You're going to be tempted to sell and that's a mistake."]},{"begin":"1228.440","end":"1272.040","lines":["And then as you get older, you want to make reevaluations. You want to kind of take a step back and say, OK, what do I need to save and what do I need to have for sure in order to have a comfortable retirement, in order to be able to make my rent or mortgage payments and afford food and afford whatever my lifestyle is?  And that means that your priorities turn from generating money to protecting your money. And so that means you want to go from a riskier something or other, like stocks, to a safer something or other, like bonds."]},{"begin":"1272.040","end":"1277.640","lines":["We'll have more investing basics with Mary Childs of Planet Money after the break."]},{"begin":"1277.640","end":"1289.280","lines":["What if you don't want to invest in funds that support certain industries, like, for ethical reasons? Are you sacrificing performance?"]},{"begin":"1289.280","end":"1334.160","lines":["Oh, this is such a good question. It is a hard one. You can slice it every which way, and you can find a study that will support your biases - whatever thesis you have might be. But studies have shown that ethical investing or environmental, social and governance funds - funds that focus on doing better by those metrics - have performed at least as well as traditional portfolios. There is a case to be made for investing in funds that will engage with management and say, hey, we, as your shareholders - I own this much percent, and I'm concerned about your use of this or the number of worker injuries or fatalities in production. All of these different metrics that you as an investor can actually say, hey, we care about this thing. Can you do better? Can you fix it? And the company has to listen because you are a part owner of that company."]},{"begin":"1334.160","end":"1338.560","lines":["These funds would generally - they would have to be actively managed, right?"]},{"begin":"1338.560","end":"1353.000","lines":["Yes and no. It, again, depends on what you want.

That's good to know. We've been talking about retirement investments mainly, but there are other ways to invest for the shorter term, and a big one is to put money in a brokerage account. Can you just explain what is a brokerage account, and how is it different from, like, let's say, a 401(k)?"]},{"begin":"1371.440","end":"1404.040","lines":["Yeah. So a brokerage account is just a little place for you to put your own money that is not pooled with someone else's money, and you can just invest directly in the market that way. So you would open, you know, a Schwab account or something like that, and you would have your own little pile of money. And you would buy a fraction of a share or a share of a smaller company and participate directly in the stock market or bond market that way. And you can still buy into ETFs and mutual funds that way as well, but there's less of a tax benefit, and there's - you're obviously not getting your beautiful employee match."]},{"begin":"1404.040","end":"1410.280","lines":["The thing is that if you're putting money in a brokerage account, it's not as long of a horizon."]},{"begin":"1410.280","end":"1419.640","lines":["Exactly.

But the idea is like, OK, if you think that we're in an AI bubble and there's a crash coming in the next three to six months, don't put your money in the stock market. You're going to then go put your money in a bond fund or real estate or something else that separates you from the AI crash that you think is necessarily coming.

Mutual funds are generally actively managed and have higher fees because of it, but they don't necessarily perform better than index funds.
