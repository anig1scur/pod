I think they were straws or colored pencils or something like that. I did not knock them over, but I also couldn't leave them there. It felt like if I didn't pick them up, I was a bad person, and this incident would be marked down on my permanent record. Basically, I knew I'd feel guilty later."

When I'm sick and a friend comes over to help and does my dishes - guilt. Yeah, guilt can ruin your life if you let it, but these are all examples of the unhealthy kind of guilt. Guilt can be a healthy impulse, when you've actually done something wrong or harmed another person."

If you're listening to this episode, I'm guessing you already have a pretty good idea of what guilt is and what it feels like - or, if you're anything like me, maybe you have, I don't know, a deep, abiding, lifelong and daily relationship with guilt. Like, you wake up in the morning, and there she is again. Oh, hey, Miss Guilt, how'd you sleep? Oh, not good. OK, well, what hat do you have for me today - mom guilt, eco guilt, work guilt, friend guilt? Oh, all of the above again - cool. Got it, thanks. Anyway, I digress. The thing is, guilt's got a sister, and they look and sound a lot alike."

Like, OK, maybe you borrow your sister's favorite sweater and then end up staining it, even after she begged you to take good care of it and was super hesitant to hand it over. You'd probably feel really guilty about the damage to the sweater, but then you might also feel shame for being so careless - like, ugh, I'm the worst; she was right to worry all along. Finding yourself steeped in those feelings of guilt, shame or both can be really tough - but also sometimes necessary."

It's a questionnaire posing hypothetical scenarios - like that wine spill - to measure people's tendencies towards feelings and actions of guilt and shame. And what she found was that people with high levels of guilt proneness are associated with lots of positive qualities. They're more trustworthy. They have greater responsibility towards others."

      "text": "Being able to love each other is such a important, necessary part of surviving communities. And that's why we experience shame and guilt - is so we can survive in communities. And so if we keep our focus on what does empathetic repair and what does empathy dictate is the right next steps right now, then we can learn to trust ourselves a little bit more, too, in that process."
