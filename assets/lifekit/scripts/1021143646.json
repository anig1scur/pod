But whether you're a longtime fan or just thinking about how and where to get started in YA, we've got you covered with some recommendations, some thoughts about what makes YA YA and some things to look for as you wade into the inviting but turbulent waters of young adult fiction."

I mean, I've seen some critiques of the appellation young adult, those who dismiss it as, well, it's just a marketing term. But if you think about it, every genre begins life as a marketing term. It's a way to signal to readers that this book has certain things in common with other books you might like."

      "author": "THOMAS",
      "text": "...Standard way to start it with. But I also think that you need to be thinking about themes specifically. Like, teens have different worries than adults. I would even argue that teens make far worse decisions than adults, (laughter) so the plot is always going to be a little bit more haywire. And another big one, I would say, is the coming-of-age stories."

I think I always think of young adult as there's heightened emotions or heightened feelings because at this age, a lot of the characters are experiencing their first - you know, maybe their first prom, their first love or something like that. But the feelings in YA are very prioritized."

So they're asking, who am I? But for adults, it's almost as if they have this - sometimes they have this false sense of who they are. They say, this is who I am, but then something, an event happens that makes them just rethink their whole, entire identity."

    {
      "author": "WELDON",

    },
    {
      "author": "RIVERA",
      "text": "And it's like the jokes just - you know, they aren't there. And so YA allows for that, like, taste of real life, you know, that authentic snapshot of what it is to be fumbling with all your best intentions forward and, like, doing your best, you know?"

And I do want to spend more time in this conversation talking about what makes this genre great, as opposed to what some devotees of what you were mentioning, Gabby, literary serious fiction, say about it because at the end of the day, what they say about this genre is what they say about all genres, and it's just not interesting. Also, they seem at the same time blissfully unaware that literary fiction is itself a genre. But that's a discussion for another day."

We have so many incredibly talented, like, literary authors within the YA genre, A.M. McLemore being one of my absolute, all-time favorites. And I think that's also really just doing a disservice to young adults in just kind of assuming that, oh, you're not smart enough to kind of understand these really dark and deep themes or whatever."

The problems and hardships that young adults face are very real and, like, very intense, and there's trauma. It's just the adult's tendency to kind of write off young adults almost like they don't remember when they used to be one."

      "author": "WELDON",

    },
    {
      "author": "LE",
      "text": "I think there is a natural desire to avoid dark topics, but I think it's also important to bring those dark topics into the light. They can start conversations. When people are growing up, I think it allows parents, maybe, to talk to children about certain topics that they wouldn't have otherwise talked about. It's a great conversation starter. So sometimes YA gets the bad rap of being too dark or, you know, too heavy."

We hate the things that make us feel soft, that, like, lean towards the feminine - right? - like, the same way rom-coms get a bad rap or, like, you know, we dismiss things that are geared towards younger people, even comics, right? Oh, you're not reading a real book. You're reading a comic or a graphic novel. And it's like, no."

That still really happens and deserves that tender care and deserves to be explored with humor and grace. Like, YA is fun and goofy but also, like, not easy, right? And what do they say, right? All things worth having is, like, things that you have to go through. They're not easy things. And so, you know, we let patriarchy dismiss things, we miss out on so much wonder and so much exploration. And YA is here to do that."

When you're reading YA, Loan, when you're editing it, and especially when all three of you are writing YA, which features young protagonist, as you mentioned, and it's read by a lot of young people, how much do you all deal with, think about the notion of pearl-clutching that might happen, you know, this think-of-the-children kind of thing where..."

I mean, that seems like a impossible needle to thread. How do you guys deal with it?"

It's impossible to have this perfect representation and, like, what that means to everyone who's going to pick up your book. For me personally, when I'm writing stories, and, you know, which largely center around trans and queer kids, it's like, I'm not writing this book to satisfy everybody. I am writing this book in order to, like, make a - like, one kid feel seen and understood and to give that representation, then I will have done my job. Like, it's my responsibility to protect my readers, absolutely, but I'm also not going to shy away from heavy or dark topics just because it makes adults uncomfortable..."

It's a queer sci-fi book with mecha fighting machines. There's found family. There's Sapphic romance and, like, those really messy, kind of chaotic relationships that we just talked that we love so much. It's - we have it in spades for \"Gearbreakers.\" And I am so excited to finish reading it. And there's also going to be a second book. So y'all need to begin on that one 'cause it's incredible."

But, you know, after college, I picked up this book called \"I'll Give You The Sun\" by Jandy Nelson. And this is for anyone who thinks that YA is one-note or recycled or petty because you're reading this book, and it's going to make you cry. It's going to make you feel everything, I think - all the feels, as people say these days. It represents so much of humanity. There's a journey to find your identity. There's some romance. There's gay characters. There's a deep exploration of parents and children, their relationship, and also the relationship between siblings, too."

They're in different circles of life. So you're getting the present day through one teenager's eyes, and then the other perspective is from another one in the past. So it's almost as if the past is kind of catching up to the present. And it's brilliantly done. You really, truly feel everything."

It's the first book I've ever read that the character was just already trans, right? Like, right? There's no, like, oh, what am I? Like, there is a little bit. There are explorations of gender. But your main character is Black, is trans, is an artist, is trying to figure out their life. And it is just so beautiful and fun.
