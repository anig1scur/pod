  "intro": "There are options beyond living solo or with roommates \u2014 and one of them is called 'communal living.' In this arrangement, people don't just simply live together, but share resources and create community. In this episode, co-living enthusiasts explain how it works and how to decide whether it's right for you.",

What about if you wanted to have some spontaneous fun - you know, the kind that doesn't require a calendar invite - grab a bunch of friends and play frisbee in the park or order a pizza and watch a movie?"

There are lots of ways to build community, and on today's show, we're going to talk about one of them. It's called co-living. That means living among a group and sharing space with people beyond your nuclear family, whether that space is an apartment or a house or a building - or even a city block."

Gillian says that generally when people are co-living, they're doing it not primarily for convenience or cost savings but because they want to live communally and to tie their lives together. And she says, actually, in the U.S., this concept that we should aspire to live alone or with only our nuclear families - that's pretty new."

It can be buying a big house with like-minded people. But it is different from just living with roommates because it's about commitment to pooling resources and collaborative decision-making. And for many, that commitment is long term rather than a stop on the way to living solo. But what feels like a good fit can depend on what's happening in your life."

And we, you know, went through, like, both kind of dreamy things and, like, practically, what did we want of the house? So, like, what do we want to do for Shabbat?

      "text": "Let's recap. Takeaway one - really ask yourself how you want to live and be open to the many possible configurations out there. Takeaway two - consider who you'd really want to live with. Make a list of the people in your life you trust and lean on. You might be surprised at who's open to living together. Takeaway three - when you find your people, make sure they're open to having check-ins and challenging conversations."

      "text": "Takeaway four - as you're choosing where to live, look for a place that balances public and private spaces and be extra thoughtful about the kitchen. Takeaway five - once you're all moved in, let the law of large numbers work for you. Doing work around the house should feel like contributing a small part to the whole. Encourage bragging, not blame. And when in doubt, blame Cheryl. And finally, takeaway number six - be open to sharing more than space. Your housemates can teach you new skills, give you access to tools and even share in childcare. Yes, there are challenges that come with adding more people to your life, and pooled resources means so much more is possible."
