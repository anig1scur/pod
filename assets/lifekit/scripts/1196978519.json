I ask because it's been about two weeks since the year started, and this is where the rubber tends to meet the road. Oh, yeah, we all have big ideas and grand plans on New Year's Eve, but then life starts to get in the way. We fall into old habits, or we fail to start new ones, you know, or we meet resistance. One of the most common goals for New Year's is to get fit, to exercise or move more. But what if your body doesn't cooperate? Reporter Aja Drain has been a dancer her whole life, and she loves going to the gym and just generally moving around."

With a chronic illness, being able to move your body may not always be the easiest. It may not move in the way you want it to. It may tire quickly. But moving with intention makes a difference in your physical, mental and emotional well-being. Moving your body doesn't need to be grandiose or a pain in the ass. It needs to be something that's fun and that works for you."

Even though my injury is temporary and vastly different from her lifelong condition, Samantha's insights made me realize that no matter what your condition, our bodies all go through changes at some point - chronic illness, injury, mental health conditions, aging and so much more."

If your body experiences a change, you're going to change, too. This concept defines takeaway one - a change in your body doesn't mean the end of movement. Change your idea of exercise to make it fit you. Before her diagnosis, Samantha engaged with exercise on a pretty average basis. She golfed, used the elliptical and lifted some weights. But after her diagnosis, she found it hard to respond to the change in her body. And for the first 10 years after her diagnosis, she told me she was in a kind of denial about her MS. Sometimes she'd ignore what her body was telling her."

Fitness isn't restricted to spin or HIIT classes, although those are still great options. Activity can be incorporated in broader ways. Many of Christine's older patients aren't too keen on treadmills, bicycles or weights."

      "author": "CHILDERS",
      "text": "They don't realize that, for example, walking is very good physical activity for the body. In fact, it is the best physical activity for the body. It's the best thing for fall prevention - is just getting up, getting, moving, going out for a walk, doing housework. If you're dusting, if you're cleaning, you're stretching. You're bending. You're leaning - going shopping."

      "text": "It's also hard not to compare ourselves to Olympians, bodybuilders or Mother Fitness herself. Megan Thee Stallion - ahh. But hopefully, the more expansive interpretation of movement can help us focus on compassion, not comparison. So we've shifted our definition of exercise to focus more on general physical activity. But we need a plan to get the ball rolling. For takeaway two, to design an adaptable fitness plan, focus on small, process-oriented goals. Cliche as it is, it's about the journey, not the destination. Caroline Brackette is an associate professor at Mercer University and a sports mental health expert working at the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee Mental Health Registry. She uses this framework with her clients."

And all of those steps add up to reach the outcome you want. The same concept applies to fitness. When you're preparing your goals for the new year, it's critical to establish, what do you want out of this? Those goals can only be defined by you and don't just have to revolve around improving your stats in the gym but also improving your overall quality of life. Here's Samantha again."

Even when the options you want become inaccessible, that doesn't mean you don't have any options at all. Remember, physical activity is broad. You can get creative and keep it simple. Some of Christine's favorite go-to to exercises are really simple and accessible, like calf raises while holding on to a kitchen sink, which is helpful for balance."

      "text": "Sometimes, our body and mind can be fulfilled in different ways. If you enjoy attending dance classes, for example, but have to sit out, maybe listening to music or still attending the class to chat and connect with peers can be fulfilling enough. If you love hiking but can't go a far distance, maybe meditating or stretching outside in a beautiful spot can help to fulfill that need. Think about the underlying motivators for your choice of exercise or movement. There are a lot of factors that give us joy."

When we're juggling so many changes in life and our ability, it's easy to lose motivation. So sometimes it's helpful to keep track of those paper towels we're pulling, even if it's just half a sheet."

You may be familiar with tracking workouts, but tracking all forms of movement can also be useful. Cleaning the house, running errands, gardening, going for a run, lifting weights - it all matters, and it all adds up. Over time, Samantha has found that tracking the little things helps her to appreciate that progress is progress, no matter the size. She kept a little planner where she wrote down everything - workouts, but also errands, vacuuming and other activities."
    },
    {
      "author": "SALVAGGIO",

Be compassionate with yourself and proud."

      "author": "DRAIN",
      "text": "Increasing your body's ability isn't the only accomplishment. Recognizing your boundaries is important to celebrate, too, because that's also a part of maintaining your health. Awareness and recognition is also a big part of takeaway four - your body will tell you when it's tired or in pain. Make sure to listen. We already established no pain, no gain is not the most inclusive fitness mantra. But understanding pain can help increase our own body awareness to keep us safe while we move."

      "author": "CHILDERS",
      "text": "So if you're doing something and you get a sudden sharp pain, you hear a popping noise or you get, you know, really acute pain and then when you do that movement again, you get very significant sharp pain, that's when you need to see someone."
    },

      "author": "DRAIN",
      "text": "Through my own injury, I noticed I could be caught between two extremes. On the one hand, all I wanted was to move and to push through the pain I was experiencing just to do something. But on the other hand, all I wanted to do was lay in bed and not lift a finger. Those extremes aren't the only options. Active recovery involves moving the muscles, typically the ones that have done the most work. That could be through stretching, exercise for tissue repair, gentle movements or other methods. Christine adds that heat, ice or a massage from a qualified individual can also help with muscle aches or soreness. But remember, she says the sharp pains you feel while moving should be considered a warning that the movement is too extreme and should be reviewed with a health care or exercise professional. In addition to those methods, giving yourself time to heal is key."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHILDERS",
      "text": "Healing uses energy. And so when we have any kind of an injury, surgery, illness or whatever, we are using internal energy to heal those areas, which means that external energy, the energy that we need for the things that we do, you know, normally, like walking around the house or whatever, is depleted because the body is using up the internal energy. So as a result, we feel tired. We feel fatigued. We get tired more quickly."
    },
    {
      "author": "DRAIN",
      "text": "For example, if you have a knee replacement, it's totally normal to take an afternoon nap. You have a new knee. Cut yourself some slack. It takes a lot of energy for daily movement since it's so stiff, and you need to build up your energy levels to help heal it. But if you're on a roll, it may be frustrating to take a pause to recover. But your body can't operate on empty. Rest is only going to optimize your next workout and can improve strength. Here's Caroline again."

And so you may also go through those stages - that denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. And so how do you manage what you are listening to, paying attention to?

It's OK to be sad for what once was. Remember, Samantha experienced this firsthand and wrestled with denial for the first 10 years of her diagnosis.

We can be our harshest critics, and negative self-talk can be a barrier to accepting changes in our body and our new routine. I should have done this. I could have done that.
