When you think about eye health, this is usually the image that comes to mind - right? - sitting in a dark office in a big leather chair, two great big wheels of lenses in front of your face making you feel like an owl, and little rows of letters across the room making you sweat. There's no way they'd put three Z's in a row - right?"

Eighty percent of what we learn about the world comes in through our visual pathway. We need our eyes to perform our daily activities, do our jobs, to navigate the world around us. So eye care is so much bigger than just a prescription or an annual eye exam. So in this episode of LIFE KIT, eye health. We'll talk about how to combat eye fatigue. We'll separate eye facts from fiction. And we'll set our sights on daily practices to strengthen and enjoy our vision. Eyeballieve (ph) you're going to learn a lot. I know - one too many puns, right?

Takeaway one - screen time is hard to avoid, but digital eyestrain doesn't have to be. To give your eyes the rest they need, take lots of breaks and be mindful of your visual space. My seemingly endless scrolling and surfing throughout my day was actually the genesis for this episode - phones and iPads and TVs and laptops. Being glued to these rectangles of light for hours and hours every day just cannot be good for our eyes. In fact, it's such a problem that the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the National Eye Institute predict that half the world's population - half of everybody - will be nearsighted by the end of 2050. Screens are a potential culprit here."

You might even have neck or shoulder pain. But there's no need to fret. We've got solutions for you. The first one is catchy. You might have heard the phrase before - 20-20-20. That means for every 20 minutes of work, take a 20-second break and look 20 feet away."

And what you're going to do is you're just going to put your thumb straight ahead of you, and you're going to make a big circle with your thumb. And you're going to follow, watching your thumb with your eyes. You're going to put your thumb in a big circle - like, up to the top of your head, out to as far as your arm can reach out to the side, and then down to the bottom. That's engaging all six of your eye muscles while you're doing that stretch. So we tell patients - we'll say do five circles with your right thumb, and then switch to the other hand and do five circles with your left thumb, going in the outward direction, so you'll go up and out."

When you have dry eyes, the vision becomes blurry, and this is something that we often see. People don't come in saying, I have dry eyes. They come in oftentimes saying, my eyes hurt, or my vision is blurred. But it comes and goes throughout the day, or when I blink, it gets a little bit better. So the ramification of having dry eyes can be really profound. And really, when you get very severe dry eyes, there are a lot of different medical problems that can be associated with severe dry eye syndrome."

Not eyedrops - there is a difference. But there have been recalls lately, so you might want to do a quick search before you buy. You could also give yourself, like, a mini spa treatment at the beginning and the end of each day by putting warm compresses over your eyes. That can help moisturize the oil glands on your eyelids that you need to make oil for your tears."

      "text": "Generally speaking, Rupa says that most prescriptions will stabilize around early adulthood, but that's not always the case. So let's break down what can change the quality of your vision. Some conditions, like cataracts, can be age-related. Excessive smoking and drinking have been linked to a number of eye diseases that could then worsen your vision. There are also some medical conditions that will do the same - high blood pressure, for one."

    {
      "author": "WONG",

      "text": "Near work is what it sounds like - any work that you focus on up close, as in within arm's reach. So all that screen time we were talking about definitely falls under this umbrella. Video games, computer work, but also homework time, reading, drawing - all near work, too. The good news is the fix is as simple as you think it might be - just getting away from the desktop and getting outside."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "This might sound a little hyperbolic, but there's a lot of science backing this up, especially when it comes to young eyes. Recent research suggests that regular outdoor time for kids - up to two hours a day is what both Valerie and Rupa recommend - may help slow or even prevent nearsightedness. That's a big deal. There are a couple of theories as to why this is. One is that, when you're outside looking at nature, you're spending less time looking at things so close up. Your eyes are taking more things in at a distance, which is important for eye development and eye rest. The other theory is that sunlight slows eye growth, which could help eyes from unnaturally elongating, which is a cause of nearsightedness."
