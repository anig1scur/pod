  "intro": "Conflicts with neighbors are common. Trash, noise, parking, weeds \u2014 there are seemingly endless ways neighbors can get on each other's nerves. But it doesn't have to be that way. A mediator and a dispute resolution expert say that taking calm, measured steps to resolve conflict can lead to greater understanding and even harmony between you and the folks on your block.",

I think you could count on one hand how many people I've yelled at in my entire life. One of those lucky few was my downstairs neighbor when I lived in Philadelphia. And look, I'm not going to go into the dispute and explain to you all the ways I was right and he was wrong because I know that I was, and I don't need the confirmation."

I think it's because this is where we live. We want our homes to be a safe and comfortable place, and something our neighbor is doing might stand in the way of that. Sasha Philip says conflicts between neighbors are super common."

As a mediator, Sasha tries to help two parties come to a solution. And as an arbitrator, she comes up with a solution for them. She says with neighbor conflicts, things can get emotional quickly. But there is absolutely hope to find middle ground and even to find a creative solution. It can happen."

      "author": "NORRIS",

Sasha has this example from a mediation she did between two neighbors. Basically, one neighbor had a big old tree with pine cones in it, and all the pine cones dropped onto the lawn of the next-door neighbor, who was not happy about it."

      "text": "In this case, both neighbors had pretty strong opinions about what they wanted to have happen, but it's hard to compromise when that's the case. So instead of focusing on those strong positions, Sasha teased out the need underneath it because if you can understand the need, possibilities can open up, and you can find more solutions for the problem. It's like Sasha took people from being rigid to flexible, and here were the underlying needs for each neighbor."

    },
    {
      "author": "PHILIP",
      "text": "And so the first neighbor who wanted their yard to be clean, their needs were met because they knew someone was going to come in on a regular schedule and clean up. And the neighbor who wanted to live among trees and nature had their needs met because they didn't have to take the tree down, and they could enjoy the tree."
    },

      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Go beyond what you think the outcome needs to be and really consider your emotional needs in the situation because that can help you think more creatively about some kind of solution. So our first three takeaways were about slowing down and doing some internal reflection. And now you come to a fork in the road. Do you want to let this issue go or be proactive? Letting go can be easier said than done. Both experts said there are times when you just have to suck it up and find a way to take care of yourself in the situation. That's what ended up happening with Casey."

I don't want to be that person. So I just try to take a deep breath, calm myself, realize it's not the end of the world."

As you prepare to do that, Moonwater says your initial approach will set the tone in terms of communication. So this is a moment to bring your best self and have a good attitude because, as I like to say, your vibe is going to influence your neighbor's vibe."

    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "And if that happens, have a plan to address it or step away. For that first reach out to your neighbor, both experts say try to do it in person. Ideally, catch your neighbor in a chill moment, not when they're running out the door for work. Sasha likes to go old school and bring a gift - maybe cookies or flowers or wine. And if you don't know your neighbor, start by saying hello."

Plus, she says, being able to read someone's face and body language can go a long way. Keep the combo neutral at first, and don't immediately dive into the problem. I asked Moonwater to role-play what this conversation could sound like with an imaginary neighbor playing loud music."

      "author": "MOONWATER",
      "text": "OK. Knocking on the door. Hey, neighbor, how are you doing? Checking in with a hello first and not jump right to what the challenge is - to make a little bit of small talk. I might tell them that I dig their tunes, and I also am trying to prepare for a big day the next day. And I'm hoping to get a little sleep, wondering if they might be able to turn them down just a bit. That's pretty different than, what the bleep are you doing with your music? It's way too loud. Turn that bleep off."

      "author": "NORRIS",

The ultimate goal here is to establish a connection with your neighbor so that you can talk things out. However you engage with your neighbor, stay safe. That's takeaway number five. And Sasha says you know what staying safe looks like for you."
    },

      "author": "PHILIP",
      "text": "I would never, ever suggest that anybody put themselves in a position of feeling unsafe. Engaging with conflict is a very vulnerable place to be anyway. You don't also want to be carrying around that feeling of unsafety. I'm a brown woman. I'm an immigrant. Knocking on a, you know, old white male's door (laughter) in certain areas in the country might feel really intimidating."
    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "She says staying safe could also mean bringing a support person, like a friend or neutral neighbor with you when you knock on your neighbor's door, or safety could mean simply leaving that mindful note. For some people, there can be the impulse to want to call the police. But both our experts said they prefer to see neighbors choose a calmer, more civil way to deal with a conflict than by calling law enforcement. And they say that is totally doable via conversations. As you communicate with your neighbor, try to find common ground. That's takeaway number six. Start by really listening to the other person, and don't think about how you're going to respond to them. Actually, that's a really nice life skill you can use anytime you're talking with someone."

And these two creatures have been best friends for 14 years. And just understanding that may create empathy and may create common ground."

    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "You can even look for common ground before you reach out to your neighbor. Maybe you have kids the same age, or you both love gardening or women's roller derby. As you see common ground, you can also seek out a neutral party trained in conflict resolution at a place called a dispute resolution center, like where Moonwater works. These are organizations all over the country and are often nonprofits that help people navigate conflict in healthy ways. Their services are often affordable or on a sliding scale. A cool thing Moonwater said is a person can reach out to one of these centers at any stage of the conflict."

    {
      "author": "MOONWATER",
      "text": "So if they are experiencing a conflict with their neighbor and they're not sure what to write in the note or whether to knock on the door or not, they can call us, and we can have a conversation with them to help them think about what a good strategy might be. If they find that they want some help in having that conversation, we're here for that, too. If they've tried to have a conversation and it didn't go well, they might choose to use their services before suing one another, for example, in small claims court."
    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Some of these centers will even reach out to your neighbor on your behalf and have a conversation with them, and then convey information back and forth between both parties. And you don't even need to speak with your neighbor. And these centers provide mediators you can work with. That's someone trained in helping people deal with their conflicts. Mediation can look like all the parties meeting in person in the same room or over Zoom. And a mediator can be especially helpful if there's some kind of power imbalance. Sasha says if one neighbor is a loud talker and the other neighbor is quieter, a mediator can set some ground rules about respectful communication."

It has a tendency to lead towards more patience and curiosity and grace for one another, towards more compassion. We even tend to change the modulation of our voice. When we think about a difficult conversation with curiosity, we change the kinds of questions we ask and how long we're willing to stay present in that conversation."
