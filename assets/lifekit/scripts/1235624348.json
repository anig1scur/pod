Friendship experts, and real-life friends, Danielle Bayard Jackson and Marisa G.

It's Marielle. On today's show, we're talking about friendship. One thing I think is amazing about friends is that these are people you choose. I mean, we don't choose our families, generally don't choose our coworkers or the people we interact with at the grocery store. But with friends, it's like you go through your life noticing other people who you appreciate and admire, people who feel like kindred spirits, and then you say, hi, can I keep you? That's incredible. We love these people and spend time with them not because we have to, but because we want to. If you flip that idea on its head, though, the fact that friendships are elective can make them feel fragile."},{"author":"DANIELLE BAYARD JACKSON","text":"We kind of know that we don't, quote-unquote, \"have to be here.\" And I wonder if that makes some of us especially tender to bringing up conflict because we know that this person can opt out the same way they opted in."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Danielle Bayard Jackson is a friendship expert and author of \"Fighting For Our Friendships: The Science And Art Of Conflict And Connection In Women's Relationships.\""},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"People are turning to friendship to offer a sense of ease and recreation and fun. It can feel risky to ruin that by bringing up something serious and difficult and challenging."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Danielle wants to encourage us to be more authentic with our friends to talk about the places we differ because we are all different. But when we communicate openly with each other without judgment, we can get closer and make space for more than one way of being."},{"author":"MARISA G FRANCO","text":"Yeah. Full disclosure - me and Danielle are friends. And I feel like you've told me before, like, I struggle with texting or something like that, and I really appreciate that 'cause I'm just like, oh, well, I'm never going to take - and I have also not been the best texter with you, too, so I've also - like, I appreciate that we're both on the same page here."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That's Marisa G. Franco - yes, Danielle's friend - and a psychologist, professor and expert in human connection. She says this advice about being authentic with your friends and willing to disagree applies to the seemingly minor everyday stuff and the more heated disagreements."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"If you really take anything today from, like, what me and Danielle says, I feel like one thing is, like, do not withdraw from your friends. Just give them the opportunity for repair, right? 'Cause you're afraid that the friendship is going to end if you bring up this issue, but you guarantee that it will end if you don't bring up the issue, and you just withdraw."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"On today's edition of Dear LIFE KIT, the series where reporter Andee Tagle asks experts your burning questions, Andee talks to Danielle and Marisa about how to communicate with your friends and deal with conflict in friendship. After the break, your questions on a couples getaway that one party is dreading, on how to stay friends after kids, and about what to do when your friend is texting you too much."},{"author":"ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE","text":"Are we ready? Ready for our first question?"},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Let's do it."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"OK. Danielle, Marisa, thanks so much for joining us. Let's do it. Here we go. Question 1. Dear LIFE KIT, I don't like my friend's husband, and now she wants us to go on vacation with him. I have a friend that I love dearly, but a few years ago, she married a man that's hard to get along with. He's cheap, rude to waiters and throws full-blown tantrums when he doesn't get his way. Before they got married, my friend and I would vacation together and always had a great time. So it would seem like a natural extension to now include our partners. However, I could not think of anything worse than spending my hard-earned vacation time cringing at her husband's behavior. Telling my friend I don't like her husband is definitely not an option, but how can I turn her down gently without revealing my true reason why?"},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"So I think, obviously, it's hard when people reject us. So what I tend to recommend is, like, a boundary and an offering, and so saying to this friend, like, you know, I actually really miss the times that we would spend together and the times that we would go on vacation together. And that was, like, so special to me. And I know that, you know, now we're married and things have sort of changed. But, like, I was wondering if you would be open to, like, revisiting that special time we used to have together? Like, would you be open to going on a trip with just me if that's the alternative that you desire?"},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"If that's not the alternative that you desire, what other alternatives can you do? Can you say, oh, I don't think we'll be able to, like, go on a trip together with you, but could we go on a day trip? Maybe that's more passable. Or could we go to this restaurant together so we can all have some time to get to know each other? And so don't go on this trip if you really don't want to go on this trip. Absolutely not. But is there an offering, an alternative offering that you could provide, which would make your friend feel less rejected, validate your investment in it and allow you to do something that you can tolerate?"},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"OK, so much good stuff in there. Danielle, do you agree? Is there a third option here? Is there another way - is there another path here?"},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Totally agree. I was going to say the same thing about, you know, maybe highlighting what it is you desire instead of what you don't. So the same thing. I miss girl time. It's just not the same if it's not us. You know, it can be playful. You know, friendship is elective. So you guys are friends. You have something special. You don't necessarily have to enjoy each other's partners. That's something they'd have to elect to do. But I think just continuing to enjoy each other because that's something special, and it doesn't have to include others, and that's OK."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I like that. Don't shoot on yourself. There's not a relationship escalator when it comes to your friendship here. Do you agree with the letter writer that she can't tell her friend the truth about her feelings about her husband? Is there any situation in which is - it is appropriate to tell your friend - if this is a really close friend, if this is someone you really care about - how you feel about their spouse?"},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Yeah. I mean, this is just general advice for giving people feedback. Instead of making it about their characters, what are the specific behaviors that you struggle with and what comes up for you when that happens? Owning that. Sometimes, our reaction to someone is also based on our own triggers. And so, you know, I might say that, like, you know, I think I struggle sometimes when he gets really angry, and he really gets upset. And like, I have, you know, my own issues around, like, being exposed to anger, and that's, like, why this is really hard on me."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"And you can, like, share some vulnerability about your own past experiences and why this person is really triggering for you, too. And so the more specific we can make it and the more vulnerable we can be by saying, this is the past experiences that come up for me when this happens that make it really hard for me to, you know, come closer because of that - because of how this person's acting, then I think we make it less likely that our friend is going to be defensive."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Marisa, Danielle, thank you so much for this. Ready for Question No. 2?"},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Let's do it."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Dear LIFE KIT, my best friend and I are in our mid-30s. We're both happily partnered off. He doesn't want children with his partner and is constantly talking about how he hates when his friends have kids, and it always ends their friendship. I'm undecided about if I want children or not, but the other day, he told me if I ever had kids, it would be the end of our friendship because that would change everything. I tried talking to him about it, but he kept insisting that I would change and have less time for him."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"It seems a little harsh to drop your friend of 14 years because they had a baby, but I believe him, as he's done this with other friends. I want to approach this again with him, but I don't know how. Any advice? Signed, Hypothetically Hurt."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"OK. This is a painful thing, but I feel like we all have a ton on our plates. Do we really have time to be upset with our friends about hypothetical scenarios, is my question? Do we have time to be pre-worried or pre-mad?"},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Yeah. I mean, my suggestion here is to really, like, start with curiosity. Like, this sounds like a place of pain for your friend. And so can you just, like, try to understand more about, like, why is this a friendship-ending thing? It sounds like they fear that you're not going to have enough time or that you're going to reject them. And I think the more that you, like, hear out their experiences around this, this negative experience around this, the less volatile they become."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"And the other thing I would say is just, like, offering that, like - the care and impact. When people are triggered, they tend to be self-centered, 'cause they're in too much pain. They don't have enough capacity to see yours. So can you say, like, I love you? Our friendship is so important to me. I'd be so sad to lose you, even if this does change how much time, like, how much love I have for you would never change. And I would love to figure out ways to still be invested in this friendship and still make sure that, like, I don't know, your needs are being taken care of to the extent that I can do that, you know, when I have kids. And I just want you to know, like, that would be a major loss for me, and, you know, I hope that no matter where our friendship goes, you would be open to figuring out a way to continue it 'cause I really love you."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah. Absolutely. Danielle, I do think this is a very specific and very peculiar hurt our friend, Hypothetically Hurt, is experiencing, and I think there's a lot in the zeitgeist right now about the chasm that can form between friends before and after having kids - a very real thing. Initial thoughts? What do people often get wrong in the post-kids friendship conversation?"},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"I mean, it definitely sounds to me like an overcorrection, right? I've been hurt by friends before. They've pulled away when they have kids, are totally distracted. They adopt new interests. They want to talk about butt cream and diaper cream, and I have no interest. And I just don't want to go through that again. And so hard boundary - not going to have friends with kids. And I get that."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"But what's interesting to me is that it's almost like this person is trying to avoid some sense of rejection, where the friends do have less time, and they do have new interests, and they do have unpredictable lives and obligations. That's true. But if it doesn't come in this form - a child - it can come in any other form. I can't - you now, so it's like, if our friendship changes in that way, I'm done. But this is one of those changes that is explicit that we can't anticipate. Who knows what's going to happen that changes my availability to you and my interests? And things are going to change. Our friendship is going to evolve."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"And Dr. Franco spoke earlier around, you know, how there has to kind of be space for your, you know, autonomy and your decisions. And I think that's why ultimatums don't really do well in relationships because you are removing my sense of agency. If I want to have children, I would hope, as my friend, you're going to be there to be a witness to this transition in my life."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I'm a parent of a toddler myself, and I can't say I'm familiar with this exact scenario, but I can definitely relate to the strain parenthood puts on friendship and the amount of extra effort it takes on both sides to stay friends with people. And even when you try, even when you really try, it can still feel like enough isn't enough. I wonder, any advice you have out there for any parents and nonparents stuck in that unsatisfied friendship limbo?"},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Well, I've been on both sides. I have two. So I have a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old. But I remember when my friends started having kids. And I'll be honest, I remember feeling bored with their conversations..."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Dang."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"'Cause you're trying to be a good sport, but you just don't..."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"...Have the same interests. And I can only go so far - right? - with this conversation. So I'm being polite, right?"},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"I don't want to have detailed conversations."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Sleep training - cool. Yeah."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Yeah. Like, oh, you know, like, come on. Where's your cool? Where's your edge? I remember feeling a little left out because I saw how they gravitated toward friends who could have those conversations, and I couldn't offer that anymore. And I remember feeling like a little discouraged because what once came with so much ease, to pick up the phone and say, oh, do you want to swing by that new place tomorrow, now required so much mental labor and calculation. Well, let me see if so and so can take the baby and then maybe - and being discouraged by it. I do remember all those things."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"But it was worth it. I can't imagine a world where that person is not in my life. That's just what was required for us at the time. And I would say now as a parent, I'm grateful for friends who are patient and flexible and they understand. It also offers understanding to me as a person, because being a mom is a part of - to some degree, it's a part of who I am. This is who I am. So to have friends who can affirm that aspect of my identity is really important."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Absolutely. OK, last question. Here we go. Dear LIFE KIT, I made friends with a neighbor about a year ago. We became instant friends and have a lot in common. I really enjoy this person's friendship and company. However, she texts me nonstop. It starts with a good morning text every morning, then constant messages about every detail of her day and then ends with a goodnight text in the evening. It's too much."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I want to be this person's friend, so I don't want to hurt their feelings, but I wish we could just catch up in person. I don't need the daily play-by-play and good morning, goodnight text every single day. Sometimes, I don't respond, but it doesn't deter her. It turns me off the friendship. She's very sensitive, and I know saying something will hurt her feelings. I don't want to end the friendship, but she is driving me away. What do I do? Signed, Unsubscribe."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Well, you know, I hear this person really afraid of hurting their friend's feelings, which I think is a really beautiful thing. They have a lot of empathy towards their friends, but consider that it'll hurt their feelings a lot more if you end the friendship without giving them a chance to repair, right? Like, sometimes you have to do what feels cruel to be kind."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"And if you really take anything today from, like, what me and Danielle says, I feel like one thing is, like, do not withdraw from your friends, just give them the opportunity for repair, right? 'Cause you're afraid that the friendship is going to end if you bring up this issue, but you guarantee that it will end if you don't bring up the issue, and you just withdraw, right? So at least give it a possibility."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"And you can just say - and offering a lot of affirmation, reassurance - hey, friend, like, really do enjoy our friendship. I really love to connect. I know that I can be really lousy at texting, and I'm worried that that hurts your feelings. So would you be open to most of our connection happening in person? Something like that. Again, owning that this is a difference. There's nothing wrong with your friend. There's nothing wrong with you. It's just a difference, and you're figuring out how to navigate it going forward."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"That's a really nice and clear-cut solution. I can read from this question that it seems like the friend previously has not been deterred from just not hearing back. If that doesn't really - if they don't really hear that feedback, you know, like, if the texting continues, if they're like, yeah, sure, I understand. You don't have to respond to me all the time. If we still get the barrage of messages. Danielle, what do we - where do we go from here?"},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"You know, maybe tell this friend, hey, sorry if I'm not responding as much as you'd like. I actually prefer getting together in person. I feel like I can enjoy people more when we're talking in person. And when I get messages throughout the day, it actually makes me really anxious. And so catch up in person is kind of my thing. So I'm letting you know that it's not just that I'm not going to text you back as much as you'd like. I am letting you know what it does to me. It actually makes me anxious to get lots of messages. So that's why I just really like to enjoy people in person. And hopefully, people can pick up the subtext, which is, girl, I'm going to need you to stop blowing up my phone."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"OK? You know? And, you know, another theme is about having space for your preferences. You know, remind yourself of what values you would say that you have in friendship. Do you value honesty? Do you value openness? Do you value there being room for both people to have their needs met? This is that. Like, this is that in practice. So it's super uncomfortable. But this is you kind of pushing back to see, is there space for me here? Is there a space for me to be in this friendship and say what I need, too? As opposed to shrinking myself so that she's comfortable."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"And I just know that if it were me and I were a person just blowing somebody up, I would want that information because the last thing I would want is to make anybody in my life feel overwhelmed or to know that they're stressed over how to let me know. I would want that information. And it's a chance for me to show them you are safe with me to tell me that information. Whether it's texting or some other detail, this is my opportunity on the receiving end to show you, OK, a little awkward for me, feel a little embarrassed, but I hear you. Say less. I got you."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah. It may be an opportunity for closeness. You know, like, I feel - we're close enough friends that I feel like I could tell this to you. And I really like the approach there, which is like, it's not you. It's me."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Yeah. Full disclosure - me and Danielle are friends. And I feel like you've told me before, like, I struggle with texting or something like that, and I really appreciate that 'cause I'm just like, oh, well, I'm never going to take - and I have also not been the best texter with you, too (laughter). So I've also - like, I appreciate that we're both on the same page here, and I appreciate when people are up front about their own style."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Like, our phones are a middleman between us and other people, and sometimes we think that middleman reflects who that person is. But for some people, it really does not. Like, they're neglecting us over the phone, but in person, we get their full attention. And so I think it's really important to recognize when does the middleman reflect the person and when does it not."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"Ooh. That's so good. She's always dropping bars."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I'm going to write that one down and put it on my wall."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"It's so good. I mean, you assign meaning to things that people do and don't do. Like, the duration that it takes of going back and forth. You could assign meaning to that. Like, oh, she doesn't care. She's not as invested. She doesn't respect, you know, what I'm saying to her. I'm not worthy of a response. I do not want anyone thinking that. It's just overwhelm or distraction. So at least kind of reassuring that person that I see you. I hear you. You matter. I also struggle with this thing. So I know it might strike up a certain feeling, but I need you to know, you know, what's really going on for me is - can be helpful, but I know that texting is a whole other issue."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Absolutely. Before we let you go, we ask every guest of Dear LIFE KIT for their best piece of advice, if anyone has one to start."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"I will say I had lunch today with someone who I was meeting in person for the first time. We've been chatting on email, but we met in person. And she was talking to me about how she is experiencing more joy in her life because she's living a values-aligned life, which I hear people say all the time. But she was talking about how she intentionally pauses to think about the choices she is making, whether it's to say yes to this email or to end the call for today and go home to the kids, that along the way, she's training herself to think through her values."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"And sometimes, that's inconvenient. Sometimes, it's awkward. Sometimes, she's letting people down. But it helps to keep her on track. And I just really appreciated the reminder to not just go so quickly on autopilot all the time and to pause intentionally throughout your day, throughout your week, to ask yourself if the decisions you're making are congruent with the values you claim to have. And that's something that I've - I'm going to try to commit to moving forward because I saw the joy, like, emanating from her, and I want to try to be more intentional about that as well."},{"author":"FRANCO","text":"Oh, Danielle, that was so nice. Thank you for that reminder. I'm just thinking about one of my therapy supervisors who said anything unspeakable to you is affecting you, and, like, to find time to spend with things that are unspeakable. Because I feel like this whole conversation has been about anything unspeakable to you is also affecting your friendships. So..."},{"author":"JACKSON","text":"That's so good."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Add it to the wall."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That was reporter Andee Tagle.

But with friends, it's like you go through your life noticing other people who you appreciate and admire, people who feel like kindred spirits, and then you say, hi, can I keep you? That's incredible. We love these people and spend time with them not because we have to, but because we want to.

Danielle, Marisa, thanks so much for joining us. Let's do it. Here we go. Question 1. Dear LIFE KIT, I don't like my friend's husband, and now she wants us to go on vacation with him. I have a friend that I love dearly, but a few years ago, she married a man that's hard to get along with. He's cheap, rude to waiters and throws full-blown tantrums when he doesn't get his way. Before they got married, my friend and I would vacation together and always had a great time. So it would seem like a natural extension to now include our partners. However, I could not think of anything worse than spending my hard-earned vacation time cringing at her husband's behavior. Telling my friend I don't like her husband is definitely not an option, but how can I turn her down gently without revealing my true reason why?"]},{"begin":"249.200","end":"301.440","lines":["So I think, obviously, it's hard when people reject us. So what I tend to recommend is, like, a boundary and an offering, and so saying to this friend, like, you know, I actually really miss the times that we would spend together and the times that we would go on vacation together. And that was, like, so special to me. And I know that, you know, now we're married and things have sort of changed. But, like, I was wondering if you would be open to, like, revisiting that special time we used to have together? Like, would you be open to going on a trip with just me if that's the alternative that you desire?"]},{"begin":"301.440","end":"344.440","lines":["If that's not the alternative that you desire, what other alternatives can you do? Can you say, oh, I don't think we'll be able to, like, go on a trip together with you, but could we go on a day trip? Maybe that's more passable. Or could we go to this restaurant together so we can all have some time to get to know each other? And so don't go on this trip if you really don't want to go on this trip. Absolutely not. But is there an offering, an alternative offering that you could provide, which would make your friend feel less rejected, validate your investment in it and allow you to do something that you can tolerate?"]},{"begin":"344.440","end":"355.120","lines":["OK, so much good stuff in there. Danielle, do you agree? Is there a third option here? Is there another way - is there another path here?"]},{"begin":"355.120","end":"406.720","lines":["Totally agree. I was going to say the same thing about, you know, maybe highlighting what it is you desire instead of what you don't. So the same thing. I miss girl time. It's just not the same if it's not us. You know, it can be playful. You know, friendship is elective. So you guys are friends. You have something special. You don't necessarily have to enjoy each other's partners. That's something they'd have to elect to do. But I think just continuing to enjoy each other because that's something special, and it doesn't have to include others, and that's OK."]},{"begin":"406.720","end":"431.960","lines":["I like that. Don't shoot on yourself. There's not a relationship escalator when it comes to your friendship here. Do you agree with the letter writer that she can't tell her friend the truth about her feelings about her husband?

I mean, this is just general advice for giving people feedback. Instead of making it about their characters, what are the specific behaviors that you struggle with and what comes up for you when that happens? Owning that. Sometimes, our reaction to someone is also based on our own triggers. And so, you know, I might say that, like, you know, I think I struggle sometimes when he gets really angry, and he really gets upset. And like, I have, you know, my own issues around, like, being exposed to anger, and that's, like, why this is really hard on me."]},{"begin":"460.040","end":"486.280","lines":["And you can, like, share some vulnerability about your own past experiences and why this person is really triggering for you, too. And so the more specific we can make it and the more vulnerable we can be by saying, this is the past experiences that come up for me when this happens that make it really hard for me to, you know, come closer because of that - because of how this person's acting, then I think we make it less likely that our friend is going to be defensive."]},{"begin":"486.280","end":"490.360","lines":["Marisa, Danielle, thank you so much for this. Ready for Question No. 2?"]},{"begin":"490.360","end":"491.360","lines":["Let's do it."]},{"begin":"491.360","end":"515.000","lines":["Dear LIFE KIT, my best friend and I are in our mid-30s. We're both happily partnered off. He doesn't want children with his partner and is constantly talking about how he hates when his friends have kids, and it always ends their friendship. I'm undecided about if I want children or not, but the other day, he told me if I ever had kids, it would be the end of our friendship because that would change everything. I tried talking to him about it, but he kept insisting that I would change and have less time for him."]},{"begin":"515.000","end":"528.880","lines":["It seems a little harsh to drop your friend of 14 years because they had a baby, but I believe him, as he's done this with other friends. I want to approach this again with him, but I don't know how. Any advice? Signed, Hypothetically Hurt."]},{"begin":"528.880","end":"540.040","lines":["OK. This is a painful thing, but I feel like we all have a ton on our plates. Do we really have time to be upset with our friends about hypothetical scenarios, is my question? Do we have time to be pre-worried or pre-mad?"]},{"begin":"540.040","end":"563.400","lines":["Yeah. I mean, my suggestion here is to really, like, start with curiosity. Like, this sounds like a place of pain for your friend. And so can you just, like, try to understand more about, like, why is this a friendship-ending thing? It sounds like they fear that you're not going to have enough time or that you're going to reject them. And I think the more that you, like, hear out their experiences around this, this negative experience around this, the less volatile they become."]},{"begin":"563.400","end":"601.040","lines":["And the other thing I would say is just, like, offering that, like - the care and impact. When people are triggered, they tend to be self-centered, 'cause they're in too much pain. They don't have enough capacity to see yours. So can you say, like, I love you? Our friendship is so important to me. I'd be so sad to lose you, even if this does change how much time, like, how much love I have for you would never change. And I would love to figure out ways to still be invested in this friendship and still make sure that, like, I don't know, your needs are being taken care of to the extent that I can do that, you know, when I have kids. And I just want you to know, like, that would be a major loss for me, and, you know, I hope that no matter where our friendship goes, you would be open to figuring out a way to continue it 'cause I really love you."]},{"begin":"601.040","end":"619.680","lines":["Yeah. Absolutely. Danielle, I do think this is a very specific and very peculiar hurt our friend, Hypothetically Hurt, is experiencing, and I think there's a lot in the zeitgeist right now about the chasm that can form between friends before and after having kids - a very real thing. Initial thoughts? What do people often get wrong in the post-kids friendship conversation?"]},{"begin":"619.680","end":"639.680","lines":["I mean, it definitely sounds to me like an overcorrection, right? I've been hurt by friends before. They've pulled away when they have kids, are totally distracted. They adopt new interests. They want to talk about butt cream and diaper cream, and I have no interest. And I just don't want to go through that again. And so hard boundary - not going to have friends with kids. And I get that."]},{"begin":"639.680","end":"676.280","lines":["But what's interesting to me is that it's almost like this person is trying to avoid some sense of rejection, where the friends do have less time, and they do have new interests, and they do have unpredictable lives and obligations. That's true. But if it doesn't come in this form - a child - it can come in any other form. I can't - you now, so it's like, if our friendship changes in that way, I'm done. But this is one of those changes that is explicit that we can't anticipate. Who knows what's going to happen that changes my availability to you and my interests? And things are going to change. Our friendship is going to evolve."]},{"begin":"676.280","end":"694.640","lines":["And Dr. Franco spoke earlier around, you know, how there has to kind of be space for your, you know, autonomy and your decisions. And I think that's why ultimatums don't really do well in relationships because you are removing my sense of agency. If I want to have children, I would hope, as my friend, you're going to be there to be a witness to this transition in my life."]},{"begin":"694.640","end":"717.240","lines":["I'm a parent of a toddler myself, and I can't say I'm familiar with this exact scenario, but I can definitely relate to the strain parenthood puts on friendship and the amount of extra effort it takes on both sides to stay friends with people. And even when you try, even when you really try, it can still feel like enough isn't enough. I wonder, any advice you have out there for any parents and nonparents stuck in that unsatisfied friendship limbo?"]},{"begin":"717.240","end":"731.320","lines":["Well, I've been on both sides. I have two. So I have a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old. But I remember when my friends started having kids. And I'll be honest, I remember feeling bored with their conversations..."]},{"begin":"731.320","end":"731.920","lines":["Dang."]},{"begin":"731.920","end":"734.320","lines":["'Cause you're trying to be a good sport, but you just don't..."]},{"begin":"734.320","end":"734.760","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"734.760","end":"739.280","lines":["...Have the same interests.

So I'm being polite, right?"]},{"begin":"739.280","end":"739.400","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"739.400","end":"741.560","lines":["I don't want to have detailed conversations."]},{"begin":"741.560","end":"743.400","lines":["Sleep training - cool. Yeah."]},{"begin":"743.400","end":"779.480","lines":["Yeah. Like, oh, you know, like, come on. Where's your cool? Where's your edge? I remember feeling a little left out because I saw how they gravitated toward friends who could have those conversations, and I couldn't offer that anymore. And I remember feeling like a little discouraged because what once came with so much ease, to pick up the phone and say, oh, do you want to swing by that new place tomorrow, now required so much mental labor and calculation. Well, let me see if so and so can take the baby and then maybe - and being discouraged by it. I do remember all those things."]},{"begin":"779.480","end":"808.320","lines":["But it was worth it. I can't imagine a world where that person is not in my life. That's just what was required for us at the time. And I would say now as a parent, I'm grateful for friends who are patient and flexible and they understand. It also offers understanding to me as a person, because being a mom is a part of - to some degree, it's a part of who I am. This is who I am. So to have friends who can affirm that aspect of my identity is really important."]},{"begin":"808.320","end":"833.480","lines":["Absolutely. OK, last question. Here we go. Dear LIFE KIT, I made friends with a neighbor about a year ago. We became instant friends and have a lot in common. I really enjoy this person's friendship and company. However, she texts me nonstop. It starts with a good morning text every morning, then constant messages about every detail of her day and then ends with a goodnight text in the evening. It's too much."]},{"begin":"833.480","end":"858.280","lines":["I want to be this person's friend, so I don't want to hurt their feelings, but I wish we could just catch up in person. I don't need the daily play-by-play and good morning, goodnight text every single day. Sometimes, I don't respond, but it doesn't deter her. It turns me off the friendship. She's very sensitive, and I know saying something will hurt her feelings. I don't want to end the friendship, but she is driving me away. What do I do? Signed, Unsubscribe."]},{"begin":"858.280","end":"875.560","lines":["Well, you know, I hear this person really afraid of hurting their friend's feelings, which I think is a really beautiful thing. They have a lot of empathy towards their friends, but consider that it'll hurt their feelings a lot more if you end the friendship without giving them a chance to repair, right? Like, sometimes you have to do what feels cruel to be kind."]},{"begin":"875.560","end":"896.360","lines":["And if you really take anything today from, like, what me and Danielle says, I feel like one thing is, like, do not withdraw from your friends, just give them the opportunity for repair, right? 'Cause you're afraid that the friendship is going to end if you bring up this issue, but you guarantee that it will end if you don't bring up the issue, and you just withdraw, right? So at least give it a possibility."]},{"begin":"896.360","end":"922.680","lines":["And you can just say - and offering a lot of affirmation, reassurance - hey, friend, like, really do enjoy our friendship. I really love to connect. I know that I can be really lousy at texting, and I'm worried that that hurts your feelings. So would you be open to most of our connection happening in person? Something like that. Again, owning that this is a difference. There's nothing wrong with your friend. There's nothing wrong with you. It's just a difference, and you're figuring out how to navigate it going forward."]},{"begin":"922.680","end":"946.320","lines":["That's a really nice and clear-cut solution. I can read from this question that it seems like the friend previously has not been deterred from just not hearing back. If that doesn't really - if they don't really hear that feedback, you know, like, if the texting continues, if they're like, yeah, sure, I understand. You don't have to respond to me all the time. If we still get the barrage of messages. Danielle, what do we - where do we go from here?"]},{"begin":"946.320","end":"989.040","lines":["You know, maybe tell this friend, hey, sorry if I'm not responding as much as you'd like. I actually prefer getting together in person. I feel like I can enjoy people more when we're talking in person. And when I get messages throughout the day, it actually makes me really anxious. And so catch up in person is kind of my thing. So I'm letting you know that it's not just that I'm not going to text you back as much as you'd like. I am letting you know what it does to me. It actually makes me anxious to get lots of messages. So that's why I just really like to enjoy people in person. And hopefully, people can pick up the subtext, which is, girl, I'm going to need you to stop blowing up my phone."]},{"begin":"989.040","end":"1022.840","lines":["OK? You know? And, you know, another theme is about having space for your preferences. You know, remind yourself of what values you would say that you have in friendship. Do you value honesty? Do you value openness? Do you value there being room for both people to have their needs met? This is that. Like, this is that in practice. So it's super uncomfortable. But this is you kind of pushing back to see, is there space for me here? Is there a space for me to be in this friendship and say what I need, too? As opposed to shrinking myself so that she's comfortable."]},{"begin":"1022.840","end":"1054.240","lines":["And I just know that if it were me and I were a person just blowing somebody up, I would want that information because the last thing I would want is to make anybody in my life feel overwhelmed or to know that they're stressed over how to let me know. I would want that information. And it's a chance for me to show them you are safe with me to tell me that information. Whether it's texting or some other detail, this is my opportunity on the receiving end to show you, OK, a little awkward for me, feel a little embarrassed, but I hear you. Say less. I got you."]},{"begin":"1054.240","end":"1063.880","lines":["Yeah. It may be an opportunity for closeness. You know, like, I feel - we're close enough friends that I feel like I could tell this to you. And I really like the approach there, which is like, it's not you. It's me."]},{"begin":"1063.880","end":"1083.320","lines":["Yeah. Full disclosure - me and Danielle are friends. And I feel like you've told me before, like, I struggle with texting or something like that, and I really appreciate that 'cause I'm just like, oh, well, I'm never going to take - and I have also not been the best texter with you, too (laughter). So I've also - like, I appreciate that we're both on the same page here, and I appreciate when people are up front about their own style."]},{"begin":"1083.320","end":"1108.800","lines":["Like, our phones are a middleman between us and other people, and sometimes we think that middleman reflects who that person is. But for some people, it really does not. Like, they're neglecting us over the phone, but in person, we get their full attention. And so I think it's really important to recognize when does the middleman reflect the person and when does it not."]},{"begin":"1108.800","end":"1112.240","lines":["Ooh. That's so good. She's always dropping bars."]},{"begin":"1112.240","end":"1116.160","lines":["I'm going to write that one down and put it on my wall."]},{"begin":"1116.160","end":"1169.520","lines":["It's so good. I mean, you assign meaning to things that people do and don't do. Like, the duration that it takes of going back and forth. You could assign meaning to that. Like, oh, she doesn't care. She's not as invested. She doesn't respect, you know, what I'm saying to her. I'm not worthy of a response. I do not want anyone thinking that. It's just overwhelm or distraction. So at least kind of reassuring that person that I see you. I hear you. You matter. I also struggle with this thing. So I know it might strike up a certain feeling, but I need you to know, you know, what's really going on for me is - can be helpful, but I know that texting is a whole other issue."]},{"begin":"1169.520","end":"1179.080","lines":["Absolutely. Before we let you go, we ask every guest of Dear LIFE KIT for their best piece of advice, if anyone has one to start."]},{"begin":"1179.080","end":"1226.640","lines":["I will say I had lunch today with someone who I was meeting in person for the first time. We've been chatting on email, but we met in person. And she was talking to me about how she is experiencing more joy in her life because she's living a values-aligned life, which I hear people say all the time. But she was talking about how she intentionally pauses to think about the choices she is making, whether it's to say yes to this email or to end the call for today and go home to the kids, that along the way, she's training herself to think through her values."]},{"begin":"1226.640","end":"1270.520","lines":["And sometimes, that's inconvenient. Sometimes, it's awkward. Sometimes, she's letting people down. But it helps to keep her on track. And I just really appreciated the reminder to not just go so quickly on autopilot all the time and to pause intentionally throughout your day, throughout your week, to ask yourself if the decisions you're making are congruent with the values you claim to have. And that's something that I've - I'm going to try to commit to moving forward because I saw the joy, like, emanating from her, and I want to try to be more intentional about that as well."]},{"begin":"1270.520","end":"1292.360","lines":["Oh, Danielle, that was so nice. Thank you for that reminder. I'm just thinking about one of my therapy supervisors who said anything unspeakable to you is affecting you, and, like, to find time to spend with things that are unspeakable.
