And, you know, every week, we chit-chat about books and reading and all that fun stuff. Now, back in January, I asked people to write in about their reading goals for the year because, you know, the type of person who reads a Books letter from NPR is probably also the type of person to have reading goals. And we got a lot of responses about either wanting to read some classic books that they never got around to or reading more nonfiction. I mean, most folks just wanted to read more. But none of those goals really mean anything if you're not working towards them, right?"

On this episode of LIFE KIT, Mansee's on the pod to talk about her piece, and our conversation got more existential than I thought it would because it's more than just about reading. It's about how we treat our hobbies, how they serve us and what's the line between a healthy obsession and one that just gives us something else to stress about?"

And then suddenly I felt like, oh, I've completely missed the mark. I felt very upset for no reason, it felt like, and really went down the journey of like, OK, should I make my goal less this year? Should I make my goal more this year? How do I sort of adjust based on what I learned from the previous year?"

    {
      "author": "KHURANA",
      "text": "One is it's definitely a personality type to enjoy having a goal to feel like you're working towards something, especially when it comes to a numbers game. There are some people who get overwhelmed by having a numbers goal, and that's totally fine. There are other options for you if that's the case. But really, I think the goal is more of a reflection on how you've been doing and how your reading has been progressing over the years. So three years ago, I kind of fell off reading. I wasn't doing it as much. It used to be my favorite thing to do when I was a kid, and I really wanted to get back into it. So I made a really simple goal - read a book a month, 12 books a year. And I was able to reach that. And by writing everything down and by writing down each book I read, I was able to see how easy it was to reach that goal. And now, three years later, I increase that goal a little bit every year to make it so that it's something that I'm working towards or working on."

    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Yeah. That tracks pretty closely to why I started tracking my reading. I noticed I wasn't reading a lot, and I think you can't solve a problem unless you kind of see the numbers in front of you, right? Now, counting one book as one unit of measurement, I think, is a limited measure because sometimes people want to diversify their readings, right? And sometimes people feel pressure to read, you know, more Dostoevsky than, you know, John Grisham or whatever. But sometimes people just want to read what they want to read, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "KHURANA",
      "text": "Yeah, I think that that is definitely a huge thing. And one of the biggest things that I sort of came out of after reporting this story was think about genres, not numbers. If you're someone who isn't a numbers person, doesn't really want to focus so much on the numerical value, you can start to think about the types of books you're reading instead of how many books you're reading. For example, if you're a big fan of long, \"War And Peace\"-type classics, it might be more interesting for you to read only three books a year. Or if you're someone who wants to read more science fiction, maybe you notice you gravitate more towards nonfiction, and you really want to change that."
    },
    {
      "author": "KHURANA",
      "text": "You can make a goal to read two new books from two new science fiction writers. Something like that can really help you still have a goal when it comes to reading but not be as focused on the numbers. There are even certain apps like The StoryGraph that give you reading challenges that have to do with reading 10 books by international authors, so you can easily track that, have really good book recommendations, and still feel like you are working towards some sort of goal when it comes to your reading."

    },
    {
      "author": "KHURANA",
      "text": "Yeah. So I think one of the best things about reading is that it can kind of expand your horizon and it can expand the types of stories you're hearing, the types of people you're interacting with and the types of narratives you're consuming. So if you're someone who maybe only gravitates towards contemporary romantic fiction, it can be really limiting to only read contemporary romantic fiction for, you know, an entire year, or it can feel a little boring. You've read the same 300-page book over and over and over again. So, really sitting down, taking stock of what you're reading and seeing, OK, what else do I want to learn about today, what are other types of authors that I want to try, what are other perspectives that I could be gaining, is a really good reason to challenge yourself with these tiny challenges and make your reading a little bit more interactive and challenge yourself to read something different."

You made a New Year's resolution, like we all do, about your reading. And then comes, like, June July - right? - mid-year, you check in with that goal, and you're like, the numbers don't add up (laughter), you know? You're not on track to hit that goal. What do you do?"

I was like, all right, well, I'm never recovering from this night shift or my reading challenge. But I think a really big thing here is to not be afraid to adjust the goal. If you realize that life is getting in the way, that you were overly ambitious at the beginning of the year, you can change that goal. You don't have to have it set in stone. Reading is one of those things where you're not necessarily competing with others, you're competing with yourself in a lot of ways. So changing that goal can make it feel less like a chore, less like homework, as you mentioned, and more like something that is enjoyable."
    },
    {
      "author": "KHURANA",
      "text": "I think the big thing is, is once you realize that you're slipping further and further behind that goal, you're starting to read books that you do not care about. You're just trying to finish the book so that you can reach your reading goal, or you're reading really small books really fast and not digesting anything because you're so in pursuit of that one number. It's better to just change your goal, slow down and enjoy what you're reading 'cause at the end of the day, this is a hobby, not homework, not a chore."

And then if you look at the books I'm reading in December, you know, they all happen to be, like, the length of, like, \"Of Mice And Men.\" I'm just trying to put numbers on the board."

      "text": "Yeah, and this is definitely for the people who are unlike you and I, who don't miss homework, who don't want to focus on a number, I think a big thing here is really reframing reading. Reading is often seen as a solitary activity, but it definitely doesn't have to be. You can join a book club, of course, or you can just have a goal to read outside a little bit more, go to a bar, go to a park. One of the other things you can do is go to more reading events in your area. I love going to authors' talks at local libraries, for one."

And if you don't want to go out and read, I think it's best to just make reading a bit more of an activity. It's not something that you have to do just right before bed, where you read 10 pages and then fall asleep. You can light some candles, get a blanket, find more ways to make reading an activity that you can enjoy at the end of the long day."

      "text": "I had so many conversations for this piece with so many different people, and a lot of them were really like, you know, you should make your goal 35. You can't - there are so many things that you can't achieve in life. Make your reading goal something that you can. But then I talked to one person who said, you know, it should be something that tests you a little bit more. And I think that I really do want that test. That's just who I am. So I will say I am planning to read 45 books this year because I feel like that number is the right amount of a challenge for me. It feels like a goal I can reach if I keep reading a priority, but it doesn't feel impossible for me to reach. And halfway through the year, I'm on track to reach that goal. I'm enjoying what I read and remembering that reading isn't an obligation. It's my hobby, and I don't have to read a book I don't like."

I'm a big fan of saying, like, you know, give a book 50 pages, dump it, whatever, who cares, right? You read what you want to read, da, da, da, da, da. I'm not the best at following my own advice, right? And I also will admit to feeling, like, some juice when I put in - enter into the spreadsheet, like, read one more, like, adding one more notch to the list, which is not - I don't know if that's unhealthy, but I think that's what you're talking about when you say, like, you like the challenge, you like the test, right? Like, there is something bro-y, jock-y to it."

You are tracking your progress, we're tracking how well you're doing at it, and it is for you to look at later and feel proud and feel accomplished. It's not a punishment or it's not an assignment that we're giving you. It is a way for you to remember and enjoy what you've been doing. And reading is definitely one of those things where it feels really good to be able to see exactly how many books you've read or remember those books and see, oh, this is the one that I really liked this year. This is the one that I gave five stars to. This is the one that I rated the highest. It is a way for you to sort of reflect later on. It is not meant to be something where you are competing with others, or you are trying to prove something to other people. Think of it more as a reflection, tracking your books, or picking a goal, not necessarily a competition."
