Two episodes flipped my world upside down, Making a Side Gig Work for You and Five Practices To Become a Better Listener (ph). And not only was the content amazing and helpful, but the people you invited on to talk about these issues were verbally diverse people. It really changed my perspective of who can be on a podcast, and it really just made me realize that my own speech impediment was holding me back. And listening to these two episodes really helped me find my own voice."

It goes, (reading) as the holidays approach and a new variant surges, I'm struggling to figure out how to balance my feelings about safety without causing drama. I'm fully vaccinated, and my plan to stay safe while staying sane has been to only spend time indoors with people I know are vaccinated and mask in all other indoor situations."

This summer, my fiance's brother asked their father to get vaccinated before coming to visit him and his children out of state. He got upset. He refused, and they caved. I know my fiance also doesn't like the situation, but I also know he is done trying to convince his father of anything. It's not my family, so I feel like it's not my place to stand up to him when his own kids won't."

And I think the first point that really comes to mind is that you're going to be married to this person, so this is really good practice in figuring out how to navigate times where you need to be a united front, quite frankly, and to figure out your role. I understand the notion that you don't want to stand up to your future father-in-law in the same way as if you were one of his children. But on the other hand, you shouldn't have to sacrifice your own health in order to get along in this family."

So I would say, have a real conversation about this with your fiance."

But I would say, you know, this is really good practice because a lot of times, it's kind of, like, this - almost this custody conflict. Whose job is it, you know? Who owns the drama with the in-laws? But in reality, you know, you shouldn't have to sacrifice your health just to keep from rocking the boat."

My husband and I are on a tight budget, and I have a large family to get presents for and can't swing this. When it comes down to it, I tend to find gift-giving wasteful and harmful to the environment anyway and am considering proposing no gifts without much hope this idea will stick - hoping for some advice on how to navigate the holidays with this disconnect."

Well, if we get rid of gifts altogether, then it's not going to feel like a true holiday, or we won't show generosity, or we won't be able to gather, or no one will care, or it won't be a special occasion. You know, it might not happen this holiday season because it might take a less pressured conversation. But this is important because this can set a precedent, right? Do you really want to be roped into a situation where your values are being completely ignored and you're going into debt for things you don't agree with?"

This one - (reading) my partner and I have a wonderful and stable relationship that is more than a few years old. I'm physically disabled and genderqueer. I thought I got along with my sweetheart's family great when we first met, but a few months after that, they started bashing me to my partner. They said really hurtful things out of, quote-unquote, \"concern\" for my sweetheart, including accusing me of lying about basic elements of my life, that I wouldn't be a good parent and that I was volatile and controlling or taking advantage of my partner. All of this is completely out of left field."

I would love to find a way to ease things between us, but I don't feel there's anything I can do without being misunderstood and mischaracterized with every interaction. I worry that they don't like the care I need from my partner from time to time and my lack of gender conformity. My instinct is to just avoid them, but I don't want my partner to have to choose between our relationship and their family."

At some point, we can expect of our partners that if we are being really mistreated, that we're being fundamentally criticized for who we are, that we're being talked about in such a negative way that it's toxic to our mental health, we can expect our partner to try to protect us from that."
    },
    {

You know, do we have some boundaries in place where, when we go and visit, if they start talking in a certain way, we tell them two times, hey; that's really hurtful; I'd prefer you not speak that way? And if that keeps going, then we leave."

I mean, that's - just like we shouldn't have to be discriminated against or bullied because of who we are out there in the general world, it really shouldn't come from people that are supposed to be our family."

      "author": "LIMBONG",

Like, something like that?"
    },

      "author": "BONIOR",
      "text": "Absolutely. Something like that can work really well, as long as it's especially communicated to the mom each time, right? You want sort of the warning. Hey, that's the second time you've mentioned, you know, their gender identity. We're going to have to leave if that happens another time. Please, let's be respectful here - you know, something like that."

This letter writer writes, (reading) I was recently kicked out by the man I used to call my dad. Consistent drinking and an unpredictable temper has made it hard to live with him without calling out some questionable parenting choices. I guess at some point, he got tired of it and decided I shouldn't live in a house he doesn't even pay for. Due to his choices, I'm left to spend the holidays away from my mom and my sisters. It pains me to think about how hard it's going to be to even try to see them for Christmas. I feel miserably alone. If I could beg to come home, I would, but that isn't my choice to make while he still lives there. How do I feel less lonely?"

I think the holidays tend to get even worse in terms of loneliness when we don't let ourselves feel the loneliness - when we, you know, say, well, I should be happy, I should be doing this, it should be joy all the time.

And, hey, it turns out this friend's not lonely, but they're dealing with a bunch of stress, and I helped them troubleshoot that situation of how to deal with in-laws or whatever it might be.

You know, what if we honored this person that we loved so much that we lost in a new way, and that became part of the holiday tradition?

But I think the middle ground really does consistently come down to saying, what are your values here? What's most important? Just like on the flip side, you know, I want to decorate, I want to gather, I want to do all this holiday stuff because maybe it feels sentimental. It reminds you of a simpler time. It connects you with family. OK. You know, if those are part of your values, there should be ways to approach that that don't mean spending $300 on, you know, fake icicles for your house if that's what your partner doesn't like. So that's something that we can keep in mind for the holidays, too - try to get rid of the external trappings and ask the deeper question of, what values am I trying to represent here, and how can I connect with my partner on that level?"

If you want to thicken a soup without gluten or flour, if you're fixing for yourself or someone else eats gluten-free, you can use potato flakes, or you can simply bake a potato in the microwave and mash it up and a potato to the soup. And no one will know the difference, it will taste great, and you won't have to disappoint anyone. So thank you. Bye."
