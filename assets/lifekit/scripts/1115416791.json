Once we've been dating for X amount of months, then we start talking about other things. And so there are kind of very linear steps - why it's called an escalator. And we move in a certain direction, and that's the only direction for it to move in for it to be a successful relationship."

The stuff you do when you're alone that feels normal might be a problem when another person is around. Partners need to contend with all their differences around standards for cleaning, going to bed, waking up. Kiana is going to walk us through some big topics to consider. First up - sleep."

So we're all going to be triggered by different things. Maybe the comment that your partner makes about you sleeping in really stabs at your sore spot. Maybe that dirty dish they left out makes you feel unappreciated. Maybe their decision to go out with friends instead of come home to you makes you feel insecure.

But really honoring the fact that I still feel safe with you, I still feel like you're my person in some way and whatever - however you're defining that, like, I would consider that really successful, even if you're now deeply annoyed the fact that this person leaves their floss on the counter. Like, people do weird stuff, you know. Are you ready for all the weird stuff if you're moving in? Like, there's so much weirdness. I love it."

Takeaway two - talk about routines and logistics with your partner. This is a time to discuss sleep, money, chores, intimacy and alone time. Takeaway three - learn the dance of your fights. It's not just OK, it's healthy to fight. But you need to understand what the root issues are and be vulnerable. Takeaway four - measure your success. Don't try and assess right away. Wait six months and ask yourself, do I still feel safe with this person? Do I still feel like they're my person, even though their floss is hanging on the sink faucet?"

And my solution to that was to start actually logging outfits that I wore and liked and putting them in an album on my phone titled \"Outfits.\" Now, when I'm feeling really uninspired, I can always look to that and remember that I do, in fact, have something to wear."
