For example, the cost of treating breast cancer can be as high as $200,000. A hospitalization for COVID-19 costs an average of $73,000. Even just getting an MRI can cost more than a thousand dollars. So health insurance offers financial protection. But that's not all."

Join the Cigna club or the Kaiser club or the Aetna Club and get discounts on the doctors in your club and your prescriptions, all that stuff. Health insurance does some other things for you too, like covering preventive services for free so you can keep yourself healthy with well checkups and cancer screenings. A lot of people in the U.S. don't have health insurance - about 28 million people. Certainly, for many of them, it's because there are no affordable options. But if you're uninsured, it's important to know that almost half of the uninsured qualify for free or low-cost plans. Sometimes people don't know these programs exist or how to sign up. That's what this episode is here for."

      "text": "First, we're going to talk about the public insurance options you might have access to. If you're 65 or older, you can sign up for Medicare. It's a federally run program. The government pays for your health care. There are some caveats here about what Medicare doesn't cover. Some people buy extra plans to cover extra things. You can find lots of info at medicare.gov. Medicaid is the health insurance program for people who are low income. It covers a lot of people - 80 million Americans. Medicaid is run by the state you live in and funded by both the federal and state governments. The details of whether you're eligible depends on where you live. Then there are the private health insurance options."

Your employer doesn't offer you any coverage. You're not eligible for Medicare 'cause you're not old enough. You're not poor enough for Medicaid. You can go to the marketplaces, apply for financial help and choose a plan there."

    {
      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "If you hear marketplaces or the insurance exchanges, they're the same thing. They refer to the online shopping tools you can use right at HealthCare.gov or through your state. Some states run their own marketplaces, like Your Health Idaho or DC Health Link. If you live in one of these states, not to fear, HealthCare.gov will still get you there. HealthCare.gov will also tell you if you qualify for Medicaid and help you figure out how to enroll in your state. It's important to know about all these programs before you start to look for health insurance because it can be scary out there on the internet."

You have to be super careful about this, not just because getting tons of phone calls is annoying, but also because some of the health insurance plans people might be trying to sell you are short-term or skinny plans. They might seem very appealing because they're cheap, but they also might not cover some basic things like prescription drugs and annual checkups, which a lot of experts warn make them not a very good deal.

When in doubt, call the insurance company and ask, is my provider in-network for this plan? Is my medicine on the plan's formulary? That's the list of medications an insurance plan will cover. One thing to note, Sabrina Corlette says, is that some plans have more flexibility when it comes to covering things out of network than others."

And without getting too wonky, an HMO is typically a plan that doesn't let you see out-of-network providers, or you can, but you're paying a hundred percent. But a PPO will give you a lot broader choice of providers. Might be a little bit more expensive to see an out-of-network provider, but they'll still cover some of that cost."

      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",

If you see an allergist your friend recommended who's not in that network, your costs are all on you. PPOs, preferred provider organizations, are a bit more flex-y (ph). They also have a network of providers. But you can see that allergist, and your plan will still chip in."

      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "Let's start with the simplest one. The premium is the amount you pay every month, like your cable subscription or any other bill - pretty straightforward. Then things get tricky with something called cost sharing. This is your share of the cost for your health care. You pay these costs on top of your monthly premium whenever you use health care services like going to the doctor or picking up a prescription, anything like that. One piece of this is your deductible."
    },
    {
      "author": "DELAO",
      "text": "Deductible is an amount of money that your insurance will not cover until you spend a certain threshold of expenses in health care. So if you have a $5,000 deductible, that means you'll be covering the first $5,000 of your health care expenses for the year before your insurance starts covering it."
    },
    {
      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "At the beginning of every year, your deductible resets to zero. If you don't use a lot of health care in a given year, you might not even get close to paying your full deductible. If you do use a lot of health care, the first few appointments and prescriptions you pick up early in the year might seem extra expensive because you haven't hit your deductible yet. Your insurance is kicking back. And when you hit that magic number, it'll sit up and start kicking in. After that, you do still have some costs when you go to the doctor in the form of a copay or coinsurance."

    {
      "author": "CORLETTE",

      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "So say you're in a plan that has a deductible of $2,000. After you hit your deductible, you'll still be paying copays or coinsurance until you hit this even higher ceiling of the out-of-pocket maximum - say it's $4,000. After that, no copays, no coinsurance. Your insurance will pay 100% of the cost of all covered health services for the rest of the year."
    },
    {
      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "Here's one way of thinking about these costs that might be helpful. Insurance companies use these costs kind of like dials. A basic plan might dial back the monthly premium so it's not too much every month, but then have a high deductible. If you chose that, you'd be making a bet that you wouldn't need to use a lot of health care in the coming year. If a plan dials up the premium, so you're forking over quite a bit every month, you'll likely have much lower other costs, like deductibles and coinsurance."
    },

      "author": "SIMMONS-DUFFIN",
      "text": "If you're shopping on healthcare.gov, there's a shorthand for these different levels of plans, and that is the metal categories. Bronze is the most basic plan. Silver's a bit better, then gold. And the top-line plans are platinum. It also has this handy tool that shows the estimated yearly cost, taking all of these various costs into account and giving you a ballpark of what your overall health insurance costs might be in the year. Some other search tools might have this as well. It's pretty useful so you don't have to do as much math in your head."

Which plans are available and affordable to you might vary a lot depending on where you live, your income and who's in your household. With the pandemic, Congress passed new temporary funding to make premiums more affordable and cover more out-of-pocket costs for people. You may qualify for those subsidies depending on your income. The Biden White House says 4 out of 5 enrollees qualify for plans with premiums of $10 or less per month. Now, the income the plan is asking about isn't what your income was this past year. You're looking forward at what your income will be next year."

Think about any potential big health items in the coming year and use your favorite doctors and usual prescriptions to narrow your choices down to plans that cover those key things. Takeaway No. 3 - learn what all those tricky cost terms mean, like deductible and coinsurance. Takeaway No. 4 - look at your monthly budget alongside your health needs to figure out what plan suits you best. Takeaway No. 5 - get free, impartial help from assisters.
