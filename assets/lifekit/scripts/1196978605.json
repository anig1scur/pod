We had an episode recently about what to do in the moment when you are feeling completely overwhelmed; you need to stop the racing thoughts and slow your racing heartbeat. But one thing we learned was that, while it's really important to ground yourself in these moments, that's not where the work ends 'cause if you're constantly having these days where your fight-or-flight response is triggered, there's probably a reason, some underlying cause of your stress. It could be your health or the health of someone you love. It could be a relationship that's falling apart, or the fact that you can't pay rent or fear for your safety."

It puts us at higher risk for heart disease, high blood pressure and strokes, and it can also increase inflammation in our bodies and weaken our immune systems. NPR health correspondent Rhitu Chatterjee talked to Dr. Nerurkar, and on today's episode, they're going to walk us through these five resets and how they can help you live a healthier, less stressful life."

      "author": "CHATTERJEE",

Maybe, like Wes, you want to have more time for your kids or other family or friends, or perhaps you want to make room in your life for something else that brings you joy. If you figure out that why, it will make it easier for your already exhausted, overwhelmed brain to start thinking about those other little changes you can make in your daily life to get to your goal."

Studies show that, on average, people spend more than four hours on their phone each day. That's more than 28 hours a week. Surveys also show that over 50% of respondents grabbed their phones within 15 minutes of waking up, about 15% doing this as soon as they wake up."

Think about what happens when you sit down to read a book, and then grab your phone to look up a word and then check messages and social media updates. That urge to constantly bounce from task to task when we're online - that's popcorn brain."

    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Because the pace of life offline is much slower than the online one and needs more time and attention. A good way to counter that sensation of a popping brain circuitry, Aditi says, is by setting boundaries with your phone. Limit scrolling to 20 minutes a day. One thing that can help you get there is by limiting the push notifications and alerts on your phone. During the day, she suggests putting your phone away in a drawer or, if possible, 10 feet away so it's easier to resist that urge to grab it all the time. At night, she suggests keeping the phone far enough so you can't reach for it first thing in the morning."

    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "So when you open your eye, give your body and brain the ability to open the other eye and just rest in the moment for 30 seconds, for one minute - doesn't have to be long. But just acclimate to the morning, the light, and then you can check your phone. But giving yourself that little moment of pause, of grounding at the start of your day can be a game-changer."

It's three seconds. And I would say this to myself under my breath; stop, breathe, and be."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Aditi says this technique can be particularly useful before you do something stressful - say, a work meeting that you've been dreading. It only takes a few seconds but, when repeated many times over the course of the day, can have a dramatic effect on stress levels. Daily movement can also help with that."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "Not only is movement good for the brain and the body, but in fact, not enough movement - or rather, no movement - being sedentary - is, in fact, bad for the brain and body."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "And so try finding ways to sit less and move more. Maybe you take five-minute walks a few times a day. Or maybe, like Aditi's patient Wes, you do one 20-minute walk every day. Our next takeaway - the fourth reset in Aditi's book - is about the benefits of doing tasks one at a time and taking regular work breaks because most people these days don't take breaks at work, and multitasking has become the norm."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",

    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "We know that multitasking is a scientific misnomer. There is no such thing. When we are multitasking, what we are actually doing is task switching, doing two separate tasks in rapid succession."

    },

      "text": "Essentially, it means doing one task for - you know, you start at five or 10 minutes, and then you take a short break, and then you do another task for five, 10, 20 minutes, and take a short break, and then do the next task."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "She says doing just one task at a time is better for the brain, and so are regular breaks throughout the day. Aditi says the breaks don't need to be very long - anywhere between three and 10 minutes. But she says be intentional about those breaks, and do something to de-stress."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "Whether it means getting up and stretching, taking a walk, going outside, doing something where you are intentionally creating a little bit of spaciousness in your brain can have an impact - not just on feeling good, but actually changing the biology of your stress in your brain and your body. In fact, when you take a break, you are enhancing your productivity."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Her fifth reset and our last takeaway can help you counter one of the most common impacts of stress on people's psyches by quieting the inner critic."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "So when there is a negative experience, it becomes sticky in your brain like Velcro. The same amount of good and bad may be happening to you at the same time. But when you're feeling a sense of stress, you hold on to those negative experiences, and there's a heightened sense of negativity."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "She says, when you're stressed, the brain uses a part of it called the amygdala."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "Your amygdala is focused on survival and self-preservation. And your inner critic has a megaphone during periods of stress because ironically, it's trying to keep you safe and out of harm's way. And so when you are trying something new or when you're learning something new, that inner critic is holding that megaphone and shouting from the rooftops, you're not good enough; you're going to fail; you'll never get there."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "One proven way to hush that negative inner critic is with a daily exercise of gratitude journaling. Aditi says, every night before you go to bed, write down five things you're grateful for that happened that day. There will be days when you'll have plenty to write about, and on some days, it might be hard to find things that you're grateful for. But still, she says, stick to the exercise, even if it's to acknowledge the basic things you have."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "One of those things could be, I have a roof over my head; I have food in my fridge and my pantry."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Over time, she says, the practice makes the brain less like Velcro and more like Teflon to negative stressful experiences. And it does this through a process called cognitive reframing."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "It shifts your focus to focusing on those good things. And that, in turn, will change your brain. It'll change your brain circuitry, and it will silence that inner critic and quiet down, decrease the volume of your amygdala."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "And now it's time for a recap. Our first takeaway is figuring out your MOST goal. MOST is an acronym - M for motivating, O for objective and measurable, S for small and T for timely. This will help your already stressed and overwhelmed brain feel motivated to make changes and figure out where to start. Takeaway No. 2 - set boundaries with your phone and other devices. Keep your phone out of reach at night so you don't reach for it first thing in the morning, and limit scrolling to 20 minutes a day. Takeaway No. 3 - tap into your mind-body connection to lower stress throughout the day. Deep breathing exercises and daily movement are a great way to do that. Takeaway No. 4 - stop trying to multitask. Focus on one task at a time, and take regular breaks at work. Takeaway No. 5 - practice daily gratitude journaling. It only takes about five minutes but can dramatically rewire your brain to be less stressed and more open to positive experiences and thoughts. But regardless of which of these resets you use, Aditi advises starting with just two things. She calls this the resilience rule of two."
    },
    {
      "author": "NERURKAR",
      "text": "The resilience rule of two is how your brain responds to change. Change is a stressor for your brain. Even positive changes in your life can be a stress for your brain. This is why New Year's resolutions don't stick - because we often have the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach, and we try to do everything all at once. Nothing sticks, and so we throw in the towel and we say, oh, well, didn't work."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "But starting with just two changes at a time, she says, will make it more likely for you to succeed in your efforts and for those strategies to become daily habits. And once they are part of your daily life, she says, then you can go ahead and try two more changes."
