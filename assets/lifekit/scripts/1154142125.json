And if your kid is keeping up with their growth charts, if their pediatrician is happy with their development, try not to stress. There are a lot of other foods that go into a well-rounded diet. We're not trying to only worship at the altar of Brussels sprouts here. And I'm honestly saying this for myself, too. Of course, if you're worried, always check with your child's doctor. They can tell you if there's something to truly be concerned about."

So generally speaking, if a child eats more than that, even though that may seem - like, if a child's eating only 20 foods, for example, that may not feel like a lot, especially to a parent. But particularly for younger children, that can be really normal."

      "author": "COHEN",

      "text": "I know. It's a real exercise in endurance. One thing to note is that an exposure to a food, one of those 10 exposures, it can come in a lot of different forms. So, for example, take a carrot. Maybe you eat a carrot in front of your kids and you offer them one. Maybe you cook the carrot in a stir fry. Maybe you give it with ranch dressing. Maybe you shred the carrot into a muffin. Just keep trying."

      "author": "HARLAN",

      "author": "HARLAN",
      "text": "Totally. It can feel really disheartening when your kid rejects a food and you just, like, feel like you went straight from the skillet to the trashcan.

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "author": "LLOYD",
      "text": "And every night, if, you know, a family's eating dinner together, you have the plate on the table and you put the vegetable on there. So it's kind of low stakes in that it's not on your child's plate. They really only will kind of reach for it if they're curious."
    },
    {
      "author": "HARLAN",
      "text": "So this is also getting at the concept of modeling. Little kids are like sponges, and they see everything. So show them that veggies are good by eating them yourself."
    },
    {
      "author": "COHEN",

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. So being really positive about the food helps. What happens when you're not around your kid when they're eating, you know, and you can't have that conversation with them?"
    },
    {
      "author": "HARLAN",
      "text": "So modeling doesn't just have to come from caregivers. For example, if your kid's eating a school lunch and they see their friend eat something off the tray that they themselves might normally reject, like a green bean. That can also have an influence on them."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. So in this case, peer pressure is good. What else?"
    },
    {
      "author": "HARLAN",

      "author": "HARLAN",
      "text": "It's a good friend. That friend makes everybody else feel like they can do it, too. And you can sort of use that pre-dinner, super hungry situation to your advantage with your kids. So try giving them some fruits and veggies as a little appetizer before a meal. There's some evidence to back this up."
    },
    {
      "author": "COHEN",
      "text": "There some really interesting research that has actually been looking at schools, for example, where they'll offer kids - while they're waiting on the lunch line. And they'll provide kids with, like, little cups of fruits or vegetables, things like that, while they're waiting on line. And, in fact, it shows that, not surprisingly, kids end up eating more fruits and vegetables when it's offered that way."

      "author": "HARLAN",
      "text": "Yeah. So this is a very popular technique, but it's not actually recommended. Because what we want to avoid is making broccoli - or any vegetable - something that your child has to get through to get to the, quote-unquote, \"good food,\" like ice cream."

And really, we want to just create, like, a no-pressure situation where kids are consistently offered different vegetables, but it's not a matter of you have to do this or making it seem so stern. Oftentimes, that can create a negative association with different vegetables."

She also said that she's a big fan of what she calls a thank-you bite, which is basically asking your kid to take one small taste of something to show appreciation for the person who made the food."

And it's also not recommended - both Kelsey and Juliana said - to force your kid to finish their food before they can get up from the table because what we really want to do is teach kids how to listen to their bodies, how to know when they're full and how to trust those signals. So if your kid says they're not hungry, they don't finish their dinner, and then an hour later they come to you wanting a snack, what you can do is you can offer them those same choices from dinner so that you're not rewarding them for skipping a meal or encouraging them to do that."

      "text": "This episode of LIFE KIT was reported by our visuals editor Beck Harlan, who might be experiencing some parenting karma right now 'cause as a kid, she used to hide her vitamins under the couch to avoid taking them. It was produced by Clare Marie Schneider. Our digital editor is Malaka Gharib. Meghan Keane is the supervising editor and also hated sweet potatoes as a kid. Her dad told her they tasted like candy and, clearly, that was a lie. Beth Donovan, who once snuck fruit onto her niece's pizza, is our executive producer. Our production team also includes Andee Tagle, Audrey Nguyen, Sylvie Douglis and Mia Venkat, who actually loved veggies as a kid because her mom is an amazing cook. And then she went to a sleepover and tasted what her friends were getting served up, and she was like, yeah, this tastes like a wet paper towel. Julia Carney is our podcast coordinator. And engineering support comes from Stacey Abbott. I'm Marielle Segarra. I will be forever scarred by the time I was served steamed corn from a can without butter or seasoning. Thanks for listening."
