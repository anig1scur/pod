      "text": "What is most important, especially as two Black people talking - I think we have to always question our relationship to how we add value to things or how we presume things to be valuable - right? - because we're operating in a society within cultural structures that often teach us that our contributions don't hold value. And so the objects that we, you know, reclaim and find invaluable ourselves - that to me is the thing that is most important when I'm thinking about especially a domestic space that I'm building for myself. Is it a family photo? I've been thinking a lot about framing T-shirts that I have. How do you take the agency in your own space to say, this is really valuable and this is the object or set of objects that when someone walks through the threshold of my home, a guest in my home, how do I tell them who I am?"

      "author": "DREW",

You know, the optics of your childhood home, if you're so lucky to have a home, will really dictate the way that you see the world, whether that's, you know, that auntie's couch that's covered in plastic or, you know, you go into the kitchen, and you see a tagine. Those types of things, you know, stick with you and how you think about, when you become an adult yourself, what kind of spaces that you want to build for yourself that either are informed by that practice or reject that practice."

He used to collect corkscrews."

Like, what are you naturally drawn to, because if you have - you know, like, my dad and my mom went to this concert in the '80s and, like, they have the concert book. And it's, like, one of the most sacred things that we have. And that is, like, something to be framed, you know, and that can just as easily become the way that you decorate your home."

And you can get a print in the range from, you know, $50 to $5,000, depending on where you're going. You know, there's amazing organizations like Visual AIDS that often do fundraisers through prints. And there's this long tradition that, you know - I don't know exactly when it started, but I learned about it through the work of Kellie Jones, learning about how even during the civil rights era, white artists like Rauschenberg and Jim Dine would have art auctions and donate the proceeds to organizations like SNCC and CORE."

      "author": "DUTES",

Like, if you go and approach these people, and it's for - proceeds go towards movement work, it's - you almost feel better because you're spending your money not just for you. You're spending it for other people. Should we be sliding up in the DMs? Should we be, you know, going to a show and being just like, listen, I love that. How much is it?"

And so I think it's important to move forward with courage, if that's what you want to do, but also to respect that people are busy, you know? Artists, not for nothing, are all running their own businesses."

      "author": "DREW",
      "text": "Yeah. It's relative to your home, of course. It's relative to what the pieces are. Because I don't personally like to put nails in my walls, I actually put Command tape. And it tells you the weight that it can support. And so I get the strip based on how much weight the resulting object has, and then I adhere it to the wall. And for me, at this stage of my life, I'm still a renter. And so I have to think about keeping the space, you know, intact when my day to move out comes. But it's really dependent on the space and what utility you have, to make sure, first and foremost, that the work is safe."
