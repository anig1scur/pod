They come in all different styles and flavors but offer users the same twinkling hope - love at first swipe. Maybe you're thrilled about all the opportunity at your fingertips or maybe you're absolutely exhausted by it all or just wary of strangers online. Wherever you fall on the spectrum, dating apps, especially in the past year and a half, have become a bigger part of our romantic lives than ever before. So how do you make the most of it?"

      "author": "HOFFMAN",

And as you said, it is not the same as meeting the way that we used to meet. It is a completely new medium and new tool. And if you approach it with the same old-fashioned rules around chivalry and chemistry and whatever your old expectations were, then it's no wonder that you would be disappointed with your results."

Those are really the things that I help my clients hone in on before we even get to the dating app. So to specifically answer your question, you should not get attached to any of your matches before you have really met them and gotten to know them. I tell my clients to think of the messages and the swipes like coins in the fountain. You toss it in and you make a wish. And if it comes true, that's a wonderful thing. You got your wish. And if it doesn't come true, it's just a penny. Are you going to get upset about a penny? That's how you really have to treat those initial messages and only start to get invested as you really get to know somebody offline."

      "text": "That's great. You have to start by having some intention, having some purpose. Let's turn to specifics. Different apps, as you were alluding to, ask for different things. But what they all have in common is this pressure to make a profile that shows the world your best and brightest and truest self. That's such a hard thing to do. It's such an agonizing process. You know, I've sat with girlfriends for hours and been like, OK, does this skydiving picture send the right message? Does it say the right thing? And if so, where exactly should it be in the Bumble lineup? And what does that say, you know? Or, wait, don't frame your favorite food response that way. It comes out a little too snarky."

      "author": "HOFFMAN",
      "text": "The profile is really the most important piece of your online dating experience. That said, I don't want people to stress out about what should go on it and really look at your dating profile and your dating experience as sort of your love lab of your life. You can test different photos, see how they do. A profile I look at as a living document. The three C's are color, context and character. Color is - it's actually strategic to stand out from a sea of swipes. Context - telling your story through your photos. And character - showing your personality."

Be specific because that will make you memorable, and it will also paint a picture. Remember, we are addicted to storytelling, so we want to paint a picture of what our life is like, what it would be like to get to know us. I also see people wasting a lot of real estate with platitudes and talking about idealized versions of who their mate is. We don't need to say that this person needs to be kind and courteous and trustworthy. That is a given. Now, tell me what's a level beneath that and really tell me those elements that you bring to the table."

Like, sometimes if daters have been online a long time or feel that they've been burned or frustrated with the dating process, many times I can read that through their profile. They'll tell me everything that they don't want instead of what they do want or every qualification based on disappointing past experiences. We don't need that. We need to keep it positive. What people tend to do is put their filters up right away, put those barriers up, and then you don't get enough options in your dating pipeline."

And the stats show that women who are proactive and send outgoing messages have far more matches. So that is the headline on messaging. First, I would say don't overthink it. Don't overthink the perfect message. Actually, my husband and I met online, and he said that he spent 48 hours trying to figure out what to say to me. He had his roommates reading the messages. He's a writer..."

Just if you are curious about something in their profile or you connect with something in their profile, that can get that person invested in connecting and communicating with you."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "OK. So we touched a little bit about how to get a match, how to, you know, craft the perfect profile. The other hard part is when you get one or you get lots of matches, it can be exhausting to have those same getting-to-know-you conversations over and over again. Having to, you know, think up that perfect witty banter can feel like a job sometimes, right? How can people keep it fun and stay engaged?"
    },
    {
      "author": "HOFFMAN",
      "text": "The first thing is, don't get stuck in the texting trap. The texting trap is when you are trying to vet someone just over text message or message within the app to see if you should go on a date with them. And you can never really tell what somebody is going to be like on a date just from the messages back and forth. So you could easily get caught up in feeling like you've gotten to know someone because you're messaging every day, you're going back and forth, you're waking up to a, hey, how's your day going message. And you are getting a need met by feeling seen, by feeling like you have connection, but you don't really have a relationship or a foundation."

How do you keep yourself from feeling alienated or discouraged by those types of things?"
    },
    {
      "author": "HOFFMAN",
      "text": "Swipe left on those people. And for those people who have those things in their profiles, try to open up. You're not looking to date a carbon copy of yourself. And I find that there's too much focus on finding someone who shares interests with you when really for someone to be compatible with you, you really only need to share two or three activities that you both enjoy together."

    {
      "author": "HOFFMAN",
      "text": "I'll have my clients make a list of all of the qualities that they're looking for, and then I say narrow it down to 10. And they look at me sideways, and they're like, OK. Then narrow it down to five. Then narrow it down to three. And I give them three must-haves and one deal breaker. A deal breaker is, like, a non-negotiable, like I can't stand cigarette smoke, and they smoke. It's something that is unchangeable - likely to be; people can stop smoking - but something that is likely to be unchangeable about that person, at least in the near term. And a must-have is really a value or a goal for the future, a quality about the life that you are trying to build with the person that you end up with."

      "author": "HOFFMAN",

      "author": "BRAMMER",
      "text": "I think it certainly does, because the truth about dating apps and social media writ large is that they are sort of a playground for your anxieties. It is a place where, you know, the worst things about you could be either confirmed or denied by people you see as cool or desirable, people who are sitting in places of authority. So what that could look like on Grindr is, like, that guy who you think is out of your league, but what if he responds to you? Wouldn't that validate you as a person who is attractive and worthy of being seen as sexy..."

The problem with that, of course, is that it's a very fragile thing because it's relying on strangers and people who don't really know you to supply you with something that can validate your whole existence. And that can be devastating if you're hinging your sense of self on approval from complete strangers on the internet."

I'm approved now. This person said, I'm worthwhile. They're onto something. Great. But what I discovered is that there is actually no end to that appetite. There's no satisfying it. The other thing is, if you're seeing another person as your gateway to approval, that kind of ends up reducing their humanity as well as yours, because they don't really get to be a person with nuances..."

When I open a dating app, when I'm set up with a friend of a friend for a date, I have to think, what do I want out of this situation? So for me, it's sort of about, like, what if - if something good happens or if I happen to meet someone today, that's nice. If it doesn't happen, I don't need it. Like, what does that look like? And you have to remind yourself quite a bit, obviously. It's not - it doesn't work every single time.

So if there's something in your life that you'd like to expand, something that brings you happiness that you think I would really love to magnify this, other people are really good at magnifying your interests just by engaging with them at the same time. So worst comes to worst, you walk away with this thing that brings you happiness. You just invested more time into it. You just became deeper into it. It's important to try to make the game in your favor as much as possible because it's a rough one, and it's hard out there. So if you can walk away feeling like I'm glad I did that without it being, like, a potential partner, then that's great."

What's your advice for remaining authentic or real within this kind of framework?"

For example, I identify as a gay man because I want to meet other gay people so that we can sort of meet each other, potentially date each other. It doesn't mean that gay people are all the same or that we all have similar experiences. It's just a useful label, a useful word, a useful term. But you obviously just want to put the energy out on the app that you would appreciate attracting. So if you are hoping to attract people with a similar personality or sense of humor, then yeah, flex your sense of humor in the bio. Just think of it as a fun little writing prompt, and you should be fine."

So if something goes poorly, oftentimes we look into that bad date, and we think, OK, what's wrong with me? Like, what do I need to fix? Am I not funny enough? Am I not attractive enough? It seems to be the case that with attempted romantic endeavors, we scour them even more to find potential flaws in ourself or in the other person. It shouldn't be an exercise in looking for flaws. It should just be an attempt to make a connection. And if the connection is there, that's great. If it's not there, we can keep it moving. But they're not each a referendum on two personalities or two human beings. It can be a lot chiller (laughter) than that and needs to be if you're going to keep putting yourself out there, because otherwise you're in for a really rough time."
