And over a decade ago, she got a call no parent wants to get. Her daughter's school counselor was calling to let her know that the 10-year-old had attempted suicide."

And parents don't even know what signs to look for or how to support a child who's having those thoughts. As Regina's experience shows, it's an overwhelming experience for the parents, too. But we know a growing number of children and teens have been struggling with thoughts and attempts of suicide in recent years."

And suicide is a leading cause of death among children and teens. But research also shows that suicide is preventable. And there's a lot that loved ones - especially parents - can do to reduce the risk that a child will go on to make an attempt. So what can they do? That's what Regina Crider set out to find out after her daughter's first attempt."

    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Now, these warning signs don't always mean thoughts of suicide. They are signs that your child is struggling emotionally. Maybe they have anxiety or depression, which puts them at a higher risk of suicide. And if they are considering self-harm or suicide, it's important to note that these thoughts and behaviors span a spectrum. And the vast majority of people and kids who have those thoughts don't go on to attempt. A lot of people have fleeting, passive, suicidal thoughts when they're going through a rough patch. These usually don't lead to attempts. A smaller percentage of people have more persistent, active thoughts that do push them to make a suicide plan, find a means to hurt themself and eventually make an attempt. And the only way to know for sure whether your child is having thoughts of suicide and how severe those thoughts are is to ask them directly."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Research shows very clearly that asking someone directly does not put the idea in their head. In fact, it paves the way for people to share with you any emotional struggles they're having, including thoughts of suicide."

And I think it makes sense that some people just, you know, want to not feel this way anymore. Is that something that's going on for you? - 'cause I'd like to see if there are some things I could do to be helpful."

And you can find a group near you on the website of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI. Or you can contact their local chapter."

      "text": "But as she's learned over the years, her daughter suicidal urges had little to do with the things that she was thinking about. It was really an internal struggle that the girl was dealing with. A child with suicidal thoughts is likely depressed, overwhelmed and unable to see their way out of whatever it is that they're grappling with. So if a parent says, what could possibly be wrong? We love you; you have everything you need, it doesn't help the child. In fact, it can make them feel ashamed of how they're feeling and overwhelm them even more."

You can say something like, I know how strong you are. I've seen you get through hard times before. I think you can get through this, too. And we can do this together. And also, help them find coping skills, things they can do to lift their spirits, make them feel more hopeful, more comforted.

And that might, like, not be someone's thing - so asking them what would be helpful."

While pediatricians aren't necessarily trained to provide mental health care, during the pandemic many states have received federal funding to help train and support pediatricians to provide some basic mental health care. And if your state doesn't have such a program, your pediatrician may still be able to refer you to a mental health care provider. And you can also look for a provider in your area using Psychology Today's online directory."

And if your child is in immediate crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The number is 988. You or your child can talk to a trained counselor on the line, and they can help you de-escalate the situation. Depending on the state you live in, they may be able to even find other resources to help your child."
