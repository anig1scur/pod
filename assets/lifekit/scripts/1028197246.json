In this episode, we talk to experts \u2014 some of whom are stepparents themselves \u2014 about how you can navigate the process. They share their do's: let the biological parent deal with discipline \u2014 and their don'ts: don't say anything to the child that you wouldn't want them to repeat to the other parent.",

In fact, stepparent sometimes feels so negative, people have started using other terms like bonus parent or other parent or love parent or even making up a name. And what do you call the children? I'm a stepparent. And for me, when I said my stepsons, it sounded like I didn't love them and was keeping them at a distance, and calling them my sons felt like I was trying to take their mom's place, which I wasn't. So over time, I began calling them my boys, which kind of feels right."

Just a quick note - we use the term biological parent or bio parent to mean the parent from the original family, whatever that looks like in yours. So let's look at practical ways to make the process of being a stepparent a little easier - essentially a road map I wish I had."

So it's very important that they create that unity and that atmosphere that makes you feel safe, as well as the kids feel safe, with coming together. Once the parent kind of initiates and forms that, then you can kind of flow as you see fit."

If the parent-child relationship is close, the new stepparent is left out. And when everybody's together, the stepparent's the outsider. So I suggest, in addition to finding fun things to do together, find one-to-one time for the couple without the kids. The parent and child also need time alone together, regular, reliable time alone together. And this includes, by the way, adult children."

      "author": "CARDOZA",

      "author": "PAPERNOW",

      "author": "CARDOZA",

    },
    {
      "author": "PAPERNOW",
      "text": "It comes easily if that person is difficult or challenging. But do it out of kids' earshot because here's what we know. What makes for poorest well-being for kids is not stepfamilies. It's not single-parent families. What makes poorest well-being for kids is adult conflict, even adult tension. So if you want kids who are healthy - and healthy kids are a lot easier to parent than unhealthy kids - you really need to not bad-mouth their other parent, not make things tense in front of kids."

You're going to say, oh, honey, this mess is so hard for me; could you help me clean it up? It's reaching. It's forging a relationship. Now, that's not discipline. Discipline would be, you are supposed to clean up after yourself; clean up right now."

That's why honest conversations with your partner are critical."
