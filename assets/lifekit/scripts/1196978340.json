And every year up until now, I've kind of just put up every Christmas ornament and tchotchke that's been handed down to me - sometimes to my detriment 'cause, you know, when you've got all these little elf and Santa figurines lined up in your pantry, you end up knocking them over every time you go to make a cup of tea or grab some spices. It is possible I got this habit from my mom."

Or maybe you didn't celebrate that much growing up. Maybe what you remember is a lot of bickering. No matter what, Elaine says that you can put your own stamp on things. And this brings us to takeaway one - reflect on your childhood. What were the holidays like for you growing up?"

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah. I mean, that's something to consider, right? Like, sometimes, when you're thinking about your emotional state and whether you want to decorate and how much you want to decorate, that's part of it, too, right? If you lost a family member around Christmas or just in the past year, you might decide, I really don't want to decorate."
    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "Right. I do a very minimal decor now, and that's actually coming from nothing. So now I might put out a plant. Like, I might have poinsettias, or I might do this little, tiny, mini tree."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "So basically, figure out how much effort you want to put in this year and how hard you want to go. Other ways to do the minimalist thing - go with more neutral colors, like beige stockings and white garlands, or put a candle in every window and a wreath on the door and call it a day. I've decided to go medium-effort with my decor this year. The Christmas tree will be the focal point, and I have a wreath, too. If you want to be a maximalist, one option is to just go big and tacky and festive - you know, lots of thrift-store oddities, mismatched figurines, brightly colored lights. But there are lots of other ideas, too."
    },

      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "author": "GRIFFIN",

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "So of course, if it's Christmas, for instance, there's the classic red and green or, for Hanukkah, blue and silver. But you don't have to stick with those. Get a little wild, like - hear me out - Miami Beach colors."
    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",

      "author": "SEGARRA",

    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "Literally, those colors that you just mentioned are perfect. I would mix silver, gold, black and a navy blue. I would mix all of those together, and that's a very calming statement."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And that would be more of a minimalist statement like we were talking about before. So taking that Miami Beach example, here's how you might incorporate those colors into your holiday decorating."
    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "Oh, my gosh, everything. So if you have an artificial tree - those silver trees? Stop. Wouldn't that make you - have a silver tree or a white tree. If you have a live tree, you could put a lot of artificial snow on it. I like the white from Miami Beach. And then you could mix in greenery. We always want to have greenery 'cause, you know, it's decorative. It's cheap. It's great as filler. But you could also use palm fronds."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. So you've identified your color palette. You know how big or how small you want to go and what you want your space to feel like. Takeaway four - get creative. And you don't need to spend a lot of money on this. There's this store in my neighborhood that makes handmade felt ornaments, and they have a whole tree filled with sea creatures. Now, while I don't want to buy any new ornaments this year, it got me in a lane, thinking I could do an under-the-sea Christmas theme for pretty cheap."
    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",

    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "I always say, in life in general, but in design in particular, time and money are inversely proportionate. To save one, you have to spend exponentially of the other. So if you have this theme that you love and you can't afford it, you obviously want to find the biggest statements in that and then make them yourself. You have to be resourceful."

      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "The room's architecture really decides where the tree is going to go. I want you to put the tree somewhere where you might have to move one piece of furniture. If you have to move more than two, that's not where the tree needs to go."

      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "In a room, the No. 1 thing that you see first is the vista right across from the door. That's a very key point. Designers never leave that empty because the eye has to have somewhere to land. That's where it lands first, and it needs to land on something very pretty."
    },

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Also, take advantage of your corners."
    },
    {
      "author": "GRIFFIN",
      "text": "Corners are great things for, like, tall plant stuff. As a rule, the tree goes in a corner because, you know, it's not taking up that much room."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And if you have other smaller ornaments or crafts, those can go on flat surfaces throughout the space - in moderation."

And we finished the tree, and we had, like, nibbles. And, you know, the room was aglow with the lights. And we did the tree and, you know, ate, drank champagne. And that was, like, tons of fun. You could also have that to undo your tree."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "By the way, I have decided on a theme. It's not under the sea, though maybe next year. It's kind of vintage cozy, with warm, white lights on my tree and lots of natural materials. My friend and I are planning to make a garland out of dried orange slices, and my wreath has apples and pears in it. I'm also using some classic glass-blown ornaments and handmade felt ones that just give me a warm and fuzzy feeling."
