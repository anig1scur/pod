It can feel really embarrassing and the opposite of fun. In this episode of LIFE KIT, journalist Ruth Tam, who's picked up the ukulele recently, talks with Joel about learning an instrument as an adult. They'll discuss how to get motivated, strategies for practice and how to stick with it."

Playing music felt like solving a math equation - challenging and fun, but ultimately extremely technical. But recently I picked up the ukulele, and that's required me to feel my way through a song. I'm learning to play more intuitively. And yeah, it's breaking my brain a little bit. But I can also feel myself rebuilding my relationship to music at the same time. I chose the ukulele because it just felt easy. It's small and portable, and I could get one for free. Shoutout to my sister, who's a music therapist and always has, like, two to three ukuleles at any given time."

      "text": "I just thought it was beautiful. I think another thing that really shaped me wanting to learn was, in King's Cross St. Pancras, which is one of the big stations in London, they have two pianos just set up there for anybody to play. I think one of them was donated by Elton John. And I've always liked dropping by there to kind of hear what people are doing. And it was one of my goals when I first started out to get to a standard where I would feel comfortable, like, playing on one of those myself and hopefully not totally embarrassing myself."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "So Takeaway 1 - make this whole learning an instrument thing fun, and that starts with playing an instrument you actually want to play and practicing songs you actually enjoy. But sometimes you have to work up to that because when you're a beginner and you only know a few notes or some simple chords, you're stuck playing things like \"Hot Cross Buns\" or \"When The Saints Go Marching In\" really slowly. And that can feel really tedious and maybe even a little infantilizing too. So I asked Joel, how do you fight the part of not just feeling like a beginner, but feeling like a straight-up baby?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's definitely a struggle. I think something that helped was that my learning was kind of self-directed, so I did jump in at the deep end and start trying to play stuff that was, like, probably too hard for me. So I was going through it, almost having to look up every note as I went along. So I was working on that, but I was kind of lucky that my wife plays the trumpet and knows a bit about music, so she kind of went, look, this is far too hard for you. I'm going to get you something easier. And she bought me a book called \"Alfred's Piano Basic\" (ph), which is the one that I now recommend to anybody who asks me, like, what my favorite resources are. And that's really basic stuff."
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "And so I kind of split my playing time between the two of them. So I would spend, you know, maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes a day doing scales and then later arpeggios and chords. And then I would maybe spend, like, 10, 15 minutes working on lessons from the book. And then if I'd done all that, I would kind of reward myself by spending, you know, 10 minutes and then 15 minutes on a couple of really hard pieces that I decided I was going to work on."

      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "That is a great way of putting it. Yeah. I would, like, get the good stuff in and then reward myself with where - you know, the stuff that was where I wanted to be eventually."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "Takeaway two - practice with a plan. How did you develop a habit of practicing every day? First of all, did you practice every day?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Yeah. In the early going, I practiced pretty much every day, and I practiced a lot. I mean, I think the most important thing about forming a habit is setting time aside when you're definitely going to practice. So maybe that's - you know, now for me, it's first thing in the morning, and then when - my wife and I kind of alternate who puts our 6-year-old to bed, so when it's her turn to put him to bed, I know I can get, like, a solid half-hour of practice in because that's how long his bedtime routine takes. So those are kind of times when it's almost nonnegotiable. That's just what I do at those times. That really helps."
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "And then I guess the other thing about having a habit is, like, it helped that I always knew what I wanted to practice next. So in any given week I would be working on scales. You know, I might be working on C major, and I would always be doing that. So I could sit down at the piano and go, OK, today's C major. That's what I'm doing. So those are my two big tips for habit forming, I think. Have set times to do it, and know what you're going to do before you sit down at the piano."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "What would you say to the type of person who wants to learn music for fun about the importance of doing scales and technical drills? Like, why is it important to eat your vegetables musically?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Well, I mean, I think scales and technical stuff just make you more comfortable on the keyboard. It sounds like it's, like, boring and tedious, and I guess it can be if you're being forced to do it, you know, when you're a kid and you'd rather be doing other things. But just seeing the metronome tick up every day and feeling, like, your fluidity of your fingers go up can actually be a super satisfying experience. You know, it's kind of like leveling up in a video game, almost."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "That's a fun way of putting it. Speaking of leveling up in a video game, I feel like you made learning piano a serious priority, and I think it's hard to go from wanting to do something to actually committing to do it. Like, the unsexy fun of sitting down and playing and practicing and being bad at something consistently every day - like, you made it sound, like, kind of easy for you, like, that it was obvious that you would do these things and that it was a nonnegotiable. And I'm wondering, how did it actually feel at the time?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Yeah. Hand independence, I think, was the thing that felt the hardest. And there were days when I was like, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this. Maybe, like, the neurons in my brain are too past it to wire together in this way. So it wasn't always easy, but I think it kind of helped that I do have experience of kind of learning stuff as an adult. So my other big hobby is Brazilian jiujitsu, which is kind of the polar opposite of piano in that it's something that you have to do with other people. You have to go to a gym and do it. But it's also just - it's a hard thing, like, and it's something I've done for a long time. So I think having done that, I kind of went into learning something else as an adult going, I think I'm capable of, like, learning to do things that are kind of difficult."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "I'm just speaking from my own experience here, where you're learning something new and you enter this stage where it's, like, not necessarily fun because it's novel, and there's this stage where you're in between being an absolute beginner and being, like, maybe an intermediate person, and you're kind of - maybe some people call it, like, your learning edge. You're, like, past the point of your comfort level. And it's just, like, very deeply unsettling to be so consistently bad at something. And I'm wondering, how do you navigate out of that stage?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Yeah, I think I probably still do have moments like that where I'm like, have I really, you know, learnt as much as I should have, given the amount of time that I've been practicing, or - you know, and I think the hardest bit to get over was probably about six to nine months in where I was like, I've been practicing this, you know, a long time now. I've probably put in a couple of hundred hours, and there was stuff that I just still wasn't getting. And I think what kind of helped with that a little bit was just kind of almost taking a break from the stuff I was banging my head against and trying to do something else. So I think at the time, I was trying to do - there's a Mozart piece called \"Sonata Facile\" which means, like, I think, like, easy sonata or beginners sonata. And that's not easy at all. It's..."
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",

    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "Takeaway three - find resources that work for you. Maybe that's a professional teacher or group lessons. For Joel, he found some really great, free, online resources, even though he does, ultimately, want a teacher."
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "I definitely think I should get a teacher. Yeah. It's one of my goals for this year. It's just a time issue, you know? It's - I know you can do online teaching, but I think I would rather sit down with somebody. And at the moment, I've got a job and a 6-year-old, and I've still got a Brazilian jiu-jitsu habit, so I've got lots to do."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "So in the absence of having access to a private teacher, I'm wondering if you have any creative, low-cost alternatives to that. I mean, you're a YouTube guy. I think there's, like, lots of resources on YouTube. Anything that you would recommend for others, either on YouTube or elsewhere?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "Yeah. So, I mean, I really recommend \"Alfred's Piano Basics.\" So certainly the first book. I actually got into the second and third books, but I think once you've done the first one, that gives you a really good grounding to kind of move into the others. I think if anyone's on Reddit, the piano subreddit is kind of a super-helpful environment. They're really friendly to beginners, but they also have little challenges where they'll be like, oh, we're all going to try and learn this piece this month. Just, you know, record yourself playing it, put it up, you know, and nobody's going to criticize you. They'll give you feedback if you ask for it. But they're very supportive and they've got a lot of great resources, and that is a nice feeling, even though you're kind of an anonymous person talking to other anonymous people."

    {
      "author": "TAM",
      "text": "Nice. OK. Let's pull back a bit. Why is learning a new instrument worth all the time and effort?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "I think for me, learning a new instrument has kind of broadened my appreciation and understanding of music. So I can listen to, you know, classical pieces and stuff like Scott Joplin now and kind of appreciate it in a way I just didn't before. And I can sort of tell the difference between different composers. I think on a day-to-day basis, it's kind of one of the few things that I do in my life that doesn't involve staring at a screen. It's almost like a form of meditation. You know, when I go and sit down at the piano, I'm concentrating on that one thing, and it takes my mind away from work and everything else that I've got going on in my life, and it lets me just sort of breathe and relax. So it's great for me in that way. It's something you can make progress on in a little way every single day - well, pretty much every single day."

    {
      "author": "SNAPE",
      "text": "There are days when I sit down and I'm like, yeah, that wasn't great. But, you know, if I've been banging my head against a difficult piece for a long time and I feel like I'm actually maybe getting worse at it, then that's - at some point, I'll, like, be sensible enough to just play something else for fun for a while, you know, like, pick something easier or just pick up a book and, like, sight read, you know, something a lot easier but that sounds nice and cool, and that kind of reminds me of what I'm doing it for."
