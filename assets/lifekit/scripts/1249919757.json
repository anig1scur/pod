When well-executed, it can unite a room of strangers and help you build your internal power. Zak Rosen, reporter and host of The Best Advice Show, offers tips on mastering the art of karaoke. And no, you don't need to be a good (or even average) singer.","transcript":[{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"A quick note before we start today's show - you may have heard that President Trump has issued an executive order seeking to block all federal funding to NPR.

Even as paywalls rise elsewhere, we offer our reporting as a resource to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay."},{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"This is a pivotal moment.

When I lived in Providence, Rhode Island, I went to a bar one time that happened to have karaoke. I say that 'cause I didn't go there to sing, and there were plenty people sitting around not partaking. Anyway, I remember this somber-looking man getting on the mic and beginning the puddle melt that would be his performance. The song was \"Foolish Games\" by Jewel. If you haven't heard it, it starts like this with some moody piano."},{"author":"JEWEL","text":"(Singing) You took your coat off and stood in the rain. You're always crazy like that."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"This song is about a lover who's done you wrong. And this guy, he got into it. He was all..."},{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA AND JEWEL","text":"(Singing) In case you failed to notice, in case you failed to see, this is my heart bleeding before you. This is me down on my knees. And these foolish games..."},{"author":"JEWEL","text":"(Singing) ...Are tearing..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That must've been the part when he leaned his back against the pillar and slowly slid down to the floor. Let me just be clear. The mood in this bar had been fairly jovial, and then this guy comes on, rips his heart out of his chest and holds it up for the rest of us to look at."},{"author":"JEWEL","text":"(Singing) My heart. You're breaking my heart."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"At the time, I felt embarrassed for him. Honestly, I was cringing at his vulnerability. But I think about the story a little differently now 'cause from what I could tell, he was going through something - right? - maybe a breakup, and he found an outlet in music. That's some of the magic of karaoke. He wasn't a talented singer, and you don't have to be. The karaoke contract states, you get up there on the mic. The instrumental plays. You sing. We witness, and we don't judge. I hadn't learned that part yet."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Feeling morose? Go ahead. Sing \"Foolish Games.\" If you're angsty, how about \"You Oughta Know\" by Alanis Morissette? Celebrating a big achievement? There are plenty of songs for that, too. Karaoke is a place where you can work through your emotions and find some power. On this episode of LIFE KIT, how to karaoke. Whether you're a seasoned karaoke veteran or a first-timer trying to muster up the nerve, there are strategies you can use to get yourself ready. Our guide for this episode will be reporter Zak Rosen. He hosts a very fun podcast called \"The Best Advice Show.\" And he headed out into the night to gather some karaoke best practices for us."},{"author":"ZAK ROSEN","text":"If I'm walking down the street, wearing my big, soft headphones, singing along to my favorite music, I sound incredible. But if I don't have Tom Petty or Michael Stipe beaming into my ears, my skill diminishes quickly. My pitch is off. My voice breaks. And I don't aspire to sing well, necessarily. I just want to not humiliate myself."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"So before I karaoke in front of a room full of strangers, I need to dip my toe in somewhere safe, somewhere familiar, somewhere I can trust that if I falter, it'll be OK."},{"author":"DIANA NUCERA","text":"Testing. All right, everybody. Sing along."},{"author":"DIANA NUCERA","text":"It's like, all of a sudden, you're on, you know? That can be scary. But you get to build, like - it's like a trust fall through voice."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Yes, a vocal trust fall. I like that. I want that."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1","text":"(Singing) Ground control to Major Tom."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"There's a place in southwest Detroit. It's best at dusk in late summer when rows of bright yellow sunflowers stand taller than people."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2","text":"(Singing) Shine bright like a diamond. Shine bright like a diamond."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"The above-ground pool is filled with clean, warm water. The firepit is roaring with flames, and the picnic table is overflowing with dates and hummus and crackers and bottles of wine. This, dear listener, is the K-Hole (ph). K as in karaoke, not K-hole like a ketamine trip."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3","text":"(Singing) The K-Hole has ascended."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE #1","text":"(Clapping) Now is the time. Now is the power. Now is the time."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"You're listening to the K-Hole co-founders get revved up for another night of karaoke. They are Detroiters Jenny Lee, Cyra Dartis (ph) and Diana Nucera - friends of mine, full disclosure. Diana was the one who called karaoke a vocal trust fall. Her backyard is invite only. And when the weather is good, like it is tonight, the K-Hole convenes here about once a month. If you're like me, you might be intimidated in the presence of these pros and their rotating crew of karaoke-loving friends. But I think coming out of your karaoke shell at a place like this - private, surrounded by friends - is a great place to start. And with small, private gatherings like this, you can get a lot of reps in on the mic, as opposed to a big karaoke bar, where you might just get one shot to sing."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5","text":"(Singing) And if a double-decker bus crashes into us, to die by your side..."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"No matter who you are or where you decide to karaoke, Jenny and Cyra have a takeaway for you, our first takeaway - there is a place for you at karaoke."},{"author":"JENNY LEE","text":"Knowing if you're, like, not a, quote-unquote, \"good\" singer, like, you don't have a good voice, or you haven't been in choirs your whole life or whatever, just knowing that there's a role for you in the karaoke ecosystem, right? So, like, you can get - you getting up there and, like, doing a song not very well, like, awkwardly missing the lyrics, all of that actually, like, makes other people feel comfortable to, like, then get up and do it. And then them getting up is just, like, adding, like, fuel to the fire that's going to then be the beautiful bonfire that is the karaoke experience."},{"author":"CYRA DARTIS","text":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"author":"LEE","text":"So don't be afraid to do that. It's an important part."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"Yeah, and I think, like, you'll start, like - I don't - I mean, I know that some people are not trained in music, and maybe our voices are very different or whatever. But even if you're going to, like, kind of talk-sing, like, it's a good time to see someone doing that 'cause it does break the mold, and it invites other people in to be like, oh, wow, I never thought about doing that - like, that kind of singing here, you know?"},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Yeah, I like talk-singing as a way in. You know, a song like \"Walk On The Wild Side\" or something like that."},{"author":"LOU REED","text":"(Singing) A hustle here, and a hustle there. New York City is the place where they said, hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"So takeaway two - you can find a song that fits your unique range and ability. It just might take some light research and practice before you take the stage."},{"author":"LEE","text":"I mean, I feel like it's just first noticing, like, what are the songs that really hit you? - and just being like, oh, yeah, that song. What would it be like to sing that? So, like, just, like, paying attention to the music that you're surrounded by and that, like, is meaningful to you from different eras of your life so that you can know, like, what it is you want to sing."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"So take note of the songs that resonate and keep a list. Think about the songs that, if they come on the radio, you automatically turn it up and know every word. Think about the songs you were obsessed with in middle school and high school, the songs you always belt out in the car. Add these to your list. I've started one in my phone's Notes app. And then from there, start practicing those songs in the car, in the shower."},{"author":"LEE","text":"Like, you have to know the lyrics."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"You mean know them, like, be able to read them?"},{"author":"LEE","text":"No, no, no."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"You're saying you have to have them memorized?"},{"author":"LEE","text":"You need to..."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Jenny, that's a tall order."},{"author":"LEE","text":"No, you need to know the song well enough that the - seeing the words cues it in your mind, where you're like..."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"You need to know the melody."},{"author":"LEE","text":"Need to know the melody."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"The melody is technically just the pitch and rhythm of the notes coming together. For our purposes, the melody is the most recognizable part of the song. So when you sing (singing) \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" that's the melody."},{"author":"LEE","text":"You don't have to have it memorized."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"OK."},{"author":"LEE","text":"But you need to know how the words that you're reading on the screen fit into the song so that it can flow. Because once you mess up the words, and, like, then you stumble, it kind of, like - it can crumble from there, where you're like, I don't know it. And then you kind of, like, lose your confidence."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Is there a way to get your confidence back mid-song?"},{"author":"LEE","text":"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Once you, like, sync back up with the melody and the lyrics."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"As for what song is in your range, there's flexibility here. On your list, you can have songs where you know you'll be able to roughly hit the notes every time. But you also don't have to forgo singing a song you really love just because there are super high notes or it requires belting. Here's Diana."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Like, visually, someone could be a really good performer but have, like, not a great voice and that. But they are, like, so - their conviction is, like, there, and they're, like, singing to you with their body. Someone could have an amazing voice, and that could be like, holy crap. Like, wow, we just witnessed that. But for me, I love it when you can tell someone loves that song."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"This is very important. Takeaway three - embody your love of the song in your performance. Clench your fist and pump it. Shake your hips. Close your eyes. Let the music literally move you. Become the R&B star you always dreamt of becoming, like Cyra is here."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"(Singing) I think you'd better call Tyrone."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7","text":"(Whooping) Lord."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"(Singing) And tell him come on."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Doing that is more important than nailing the technical performance."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"I think, to me, like, just love that song so much, and, like, they're feeling or figuring something out when they sing it. To me, that makes a beautiful performance."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Karaoke is a chance to channel that singer you love. You get to be a pop star for a few minutes, so give pop star during your performance. Diana is a ringer. She's so good. She puts out records as Mother Cyborg and credits karaoke with helping her find her voice."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"I started recording and then a band because I was karaoking (ph). I found my voice through karaoke."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Takeaway No. 4 - warm up. Before she sings, Diana loosens up her vocal cords with a breathing exercise, which we can and should do, too."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"The hee-ha (ph)."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8","text":"Oh."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Hee-ha, hee-ha, hee-ha, hee-ha."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8","text":"Damn."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"So how do - will you teach us how to do that? What do we do?"},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"So you say he..."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"...And you just kind of give it all your might, like, he."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"He."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Yeah, and then you do ha."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Ha."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"And that's the way that you engage your diaphragm."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Singing from your diaphragm is something people are always talking about. It seems important."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I don't know what my diaphragm is."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"That's what pushes the breath through your lungs, and that's how you control your breath and stuff like that is with your diaphragm. So when you do the he-ha, you learn how to feel it so that you can engage it when you're singing."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"So do your he-has. He, ha. He, ha. You can make a siren noise with your lips like this - (vocalizing). You can try an exercise where you inhale for four counts, (inhaling), then exhale in a hiss, (exhaling), for eight to 12 counts."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Vocal exercises like these can build up your singing muscles and help you hold notes for longer. And yet another byproduct of these warmups? They help you activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which will help ground you, easing those pre-karaoke jitters. The last warmup Diana teaches me is something she calls loose lips - (flapping lips)."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Yeah. And that just loosens your face up, and the looser your face is, the more you're just, like, using your lips to make the shapes to have the sounds. He-ha, loose lips."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Exactly. If you remember one thing tonight, folks, it's the he-ha loose lips."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I've done a fair amount of singing at private karaoke parties, but very little out in the world in front of strangers. But I want to try it. I'm not confident in my singing voice, though, nor do I think I can sell my performance with cool, evocative moves, like the K-holers prescribe. So I'm going to take some time, I'm going to pay attention to the songs ringing around in my head and rehearse in the shower."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Singing) Well, you got the moves have you got the touch? Don't get me wrong, oh, I think you're all right."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"And I'm going to work on my breathing techniques. But I could also use a pep talk, and I know the perfect person, Abigail Bengson. She brings us Takeaway 5 - karaoke is a way to get free and to build power."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"And then as far as, like, what you do, what do you say?"},{"author":"ABIGAIL BENGSON","text":"I usually say I'm a singer, a composer and a singer."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"OK. I was thinking a song priestess, but that's..."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"(Laughter) I don't know if I can claim that for myself, but if you want to call me that..."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"...I would be honored (laughter)."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Abigail and her partner, Shaun, make up the Bengsons, a musical duo that puts out albums and musicals. They just finished up a run as the house band of the Broadway show \"All In.\" You might have seen their raw, gorgeous stuff on Instagram, like this one from early in the pandemic."},{"author":"THE BENGSONS","text":"(Singing) I am Abigail, and this is Shaun, and we're so glad that you've turned this on and welcomed us into your home. And you are welcome into our home. We're in Dayton, Ohio, in Shaun's parents' house."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I think we have the tendency to be the devils on our own shoulders telling ourselves we can't do it. But Abigail is here to tell us we can, and it's going to be amazing."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"We have a vocabulary growing about body positivity, body acceptance, body love. And we don't have a vocabulary around voice acceptance, voice positivity, vocal love, even though that is so often the way we meet the world is through our voices. And your voice is from your family. It's cultural. But I also have a feeling that everyone's voice is like a fingerprint. Like, it's something truly, completely your own when you allow it to be. And I'm not very interested in an excellent singing voice, just in the same way that I don't think there's such a thing as an excellent body. I think that there are more or less liberated bodies, more or less liberated voices."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"What Abigail looks for in a singer is someone who's willing to be brave enough to get free onstage."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"When they get free, I get free. Being vulnerable like that is a gift. You're modeling vulnerability. You're modeling courage. What an incredible thing, no matter what happens next."},{"author":"THE BENGSONS","text":"(Singing) We will be together tonight for the keep going on, keep going on song. This is the keep going, keep going..."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"Yeah, I think it's also an exercise in building power in yourself."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"K-holer Cyra Dartis (ph)."},{"author":"DARTIS","text":"Like, for me, that's why I started doing karaoke, because I was like, I need to exercise power. And I need to find it in myself and, like, figure out how to tap into it. And it is like a wielding of - like, goofy wielding of power moment."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Now is the time, now is the hour, now is the time for K-hole power. Now is the time."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"My family and I moved to Amsterdam last year, and on a recent Thursday night, I set off for a popular tourist district in the center of the city. When you're en route to your performance like I am, you might consider building your own preshow routine. Have your song list ready, run through the songs you think you might sing. Do some of your vocal warmups. Takeaway 6, create your own preshow ritual."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"OK, I am on my bike on the way to the karaoke bar. Oh, God. Oh, gosh. OK, just do your voice warmups, buddy - (flapping lips)."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I'm headed to Coco's Outback, a cavernous, Australian-themed sports bar that's known to have a rocking weekly karaoke night."},{"author":"BORIS NOLANS","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Coco's Outback. It's Tuesday night again, so we're going to sing some songs tonight."},{"author":"BORIS NOLANS","text":"I'm Boris Nolans (ph). I live in Amsterdam. I'm 24 years old. I've been doing the emceeing for about a year now."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"What advice would you give people who haven't sung before who are about to sing in front of a group of people?"},{"author":"NOLANS","text":"If you're with a group, peer pressure 100% helps."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"NOLANS","text":"And after that, yeah, just try to find a song that people like, a song that other people will also sing along with so you're not standing in front of a crowded, quiet, listening, looking at you..."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Don't pick an obscure song."},{"author":"NOLANS","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"NOLANS","text":"Pick something easy, something that everyone knows, mainstream. And then just go for it."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"So if you're gotten up there, you've chosen your Aerosmith song or your Billie Eilish song, and you are ready to go..."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Song priestess Abigail Bengson once again."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"I would say, take a deep breath, feel your feet on the ground. Don't worry about what it's going to look like or sound like - think about how it's going to feel. I'd say, ask yourself, what's going to happen? And then tell the truth, which is, I don't know (laughter). And then, man, life is too long and too short. Grab a little bit of joy where you can. Take pleasure. Excellence is not that interesting."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"People half my age slowly emerge on the dance floor. They're singing and dancing to songs I've never heard. Boris (ph), the MC, asks me what song I'm going to do. After more than a week of internal debate, I tell him. \"You Can Call Me Al.\" What is it? \"You Can Call Me Al\" by Paul Simon. You're not going to do something mainstream, he says? Well, it was really popular in the '80s, I tell him. He eyes me with suspicion and pity, and he tells me I should take a shot."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"He brings me a Jagerbomb. That's a shot of Jagermeister dropped inside a Red Bull. I've never had Jagermeister. I've never had Red Bull. But I down it with him because I feel it would be rude to turn it away. I want to clarify - you don't have to drink to enjoy karaoke. Lots of my friends who are sober love karaoke. And not for nothing, LIFE KIT has some solid episodes about understanding the risks of alcohol. Boris says I have about 15 minutes till he'll call me to the stage."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Then I remember something Cyra and Jenny from the K-Hole advised me to do. They said, before you go up, go to the bathroom. Put in your earbuds and do some last-second rehearsing. Down low practice, one last time. So that's what I do in the privacy of the bathroom. And also one last hee-ha."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I'm in the bathroom, going to do my vocal warmups one last time. Hee-ha, hee-ha."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I'm relieved when the very young people recognize the song. See, Boris? It is mainstream. I start bobbing my head, shaking my hips. I nail the first few words, then I lose track of where I am. Oh, God."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Singing) Soft in the middle. Why am I soft in the middle? Rest of my life is so hard."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"This is not going as planned. Then a drunk guy - probably 25 years old tops - jumps up on stage and puts his arm around me, so I hand him the mic."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Singing) Along, along, there were..."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #10","text":"(Singing) There were incidents and accidents. There were hints and allegations."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Singing) You can be my bodyguard."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"And then I remember Diana and Jenny's wise words."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Is there a way to get your confidence back mid-song?"},{"author":"LEE","text":"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Once you, like, sync back up with the melody and the lyrics."},{"author":"NUCERA","text":"Like when a record skips. Just put it back on the groove."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Singing) I can call you Betty. And, Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I find my footing, kind of. But I realize no one cares how well I'm singing. They care that I am singing, that I'm up there awkwardly, but finding some fun in the midst of it."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Vocalizing)."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"I survived the performance. I'm not being self-deprecating when I say, I sucked. But after getting over my nerves, I genuinely had a great time singing and stumbling in front of strangers. And I feel far less fear and more audacious because of it. Thanks, karaoke."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Before I let you go practicing your next song, let's recap. Takeaway No. 1 - no matter who you are, there is a place for you at karaoke. Takeaway No. 2 - you can find a song that fits your unique range and ability. You just need to seek it out and pay attention to songs that move you. Takeaway No. 3 - if you outwardly love the song you're performing, the audience will, too. Takeaway No. 4 - warm up your voice before you sing. Hee-ha. (Vocalizing). Takeaway No. 5 - karaoke isn't just about singing. It's about making yourself vulnerable, singing yourself free and realizing your power."},{"author":"BENGSON","text":"And when someone else has the courage and vulnerability to unlock their own freedom in front of others, that part of us, no matter how buried, can't help but rise up and run towards the walls we've built and knock them down if they can."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Takeaway No. 6 - make your own preshow ritual, which will give you confidence and clarity heading into your performance."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"Since my \"You Can Call Me Al\" moment at Coco's, I've karaoked (ph) two more times. I rented a private room with my wife and our friends. The stakes were a lot lower. The energy was much higher. The vibes were fantastic."},{"author":"ZAK ROSEN AND UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE #2","text":"(Singing) Everybody look left. Everybody look right. Everywhere you look, I'm standing in the spotlight. Not yet."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"That thing I said earlier about paying attention to the songs you loved in middle school - that has really been true for me lately. Choose your song. Choose your stage. Get free. Have fun. That is karaoke."},{"author":"ROSEN AND UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE #2","text":"(Singing) Oh, I just can't wait to be king."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #11","text":"So good."},{"author":"ROSEN","text":"(Whooping) That's..."},{"author":"UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #11","text":"That's a great one."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That was reporter and host of \"The Best Advice Show,\" Zak Rosen.
