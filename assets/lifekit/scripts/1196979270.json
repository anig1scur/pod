  "intro": "Taylor Swift claimed that \"jet lag is a choice\" at this year's Super Bowl. Sleep scientists like Jade Wu would like you to know they very much disagree. The disorder can throw your body clock out of whack and leave you feeling sluggish \u2014 not great when you're on a big vacation abroad. Wu explains how to make jet lag less miserable and more manageable.",

If you're lucky enough to have traveled several time zones in a matter of hours, then you've most likely experienced jet lag - feeling groggy, out of sync with your surroundings and overall crappy. This year, Taylor Swift caused a stir for answering a question after the Super Bowl about her flight - on a private jet no less - from Tokyo to Las Vegas after she performed. When asked, how do you not have jet lag right now? She said, maybe jokingly, jet lag is a choice."

So jet lag is one form of it. Shift work is another form. You know, being an extreme night owl some days of the week is another form. So jet lag is just the easiest-to-understand form of circadian misalignment."

So if you're taking two months across the ocean, then you'll have adjusted already by the time you arrive here. But if you're flying in a few hours, you know, your body wakes up, you know, in United States Eastern Time and then goes to bed London time - it's going to be very, very confused. The speed at which we cross time zones is not meant to be this fast."

    {
      "author": "WU",
      "text": "Right. So in a nutshell, our bodies during jet leg - we are basically misaligned with our outside environment, which means the internal body clocks - which we have billions of them. All of our cells have their own clocks, our organ systems, our hormone systems, our brain, you know, cognitive function, blood pressure. Everything that runs in our body runs on a clock. And ideally, what's happening is all these clocks are synced up to each other and running on a predictable, consistent schedule. And what happens during jet lag is suddenly, all of these clocks are confused. Like, wait a second. I thought it was daytime. Why is it night? Or I thought it was supposed to be dark. You know, why is it so bright in the environment? So then our brain gets confused."

      "author": "WU",
      "text": "The master clock in our brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the SCN - if that suprachiasmatic nucleus gets confused, then all of the clocks get confused. So think of all the clocks in your body as, like - it's like a billion-person orchestra. And the master clock, the SCN, is the maestro. And if the maestro can't keep time, then the entire orchestra falls apart, right?"

      "text": "Yep. So there are a few things you can do before travel, during travel and after travel. So first of all, I would say it depends on how far you're going and how long your trip is. So if it's, like, a one- to two-hour time difference and you're only going for a few days, you might as well just stay on your regular schedule. Like, recently, I went to see my best friend in Colorado. I usually live in North Carolina. I just stayed on my regular Eastern Time schedule. So from her perspective, I was, like, a super early morning riser and..."

    },
    {
      "author": "BARBER",
      "text": "Part of that preparation can be booking a flight that isn't going to disrupt your sleep too much - if you can swing it. Once your flight is set, it's time for takeaway number two - prepare for jet lag by resting up beforehand. That means time-shifting your sleep little by little but also getting more sleep before your trip."
    },
    {
      "author": "WU",
      "text": "This is called banking sleep. I wouldn't, you know, push it too hard - like, don't force yourself to sleep when you're not sleepy, but make sure you do get lots of opportunity. And if your body really even has a little bit of desire to sleep, let it do so. You can even take some supplemental naps. So bank sleep, first of all, and then you can also start gradually shifting your timing towards the target time zone. So if you're traveling six hours east to Europe from the East Coast here, you can start getting up, you know, 15 or 30 minutes earlier every day, going to bed 15 to 30 minutes earlier every day. And do that for a few days, maybe a week or so. You won't be all the way adjusted over, maybe, but you'll be closer, and you'll be more ready to adjust to your new local time by the time you get there."

Jade generally discourages using caffeine to fight jet lag because it can lead to unpredictable outcomes - so sometimes making you exhausted or wired or both. But if you must, you could aim to have some caffeine if you're heading eastbound to stay up. Avoid it if you're going west. Speaking of direction, it's helpful to keep in mind which way you're headed."

And so that's why going west is easier because your body already kind of wants to go to bed later."

If you're traveling east, try to stay up during your flight, and that might be hard because you might have gotten up really early to go to the airport and, you know, whatnot. But try your best. You know, watch movies. And now, when you land, you're going to not be sleepy yet by the local bedtime, so you might need to take a sleep aid to help yourself fall asleep that night, or you could just rough it and just go to bed really, really late and sleep a short night."

      "author": "WU",
      "text": "So the best thing to do is get lots of light first thing in the morning local time. So ideally, you go outside. You exercise. You walk. You hike. You go around town. The quicker you sort of get actively engaged in the rhythm of the local schedule, the more quickly you'll adjust, especially when it comes to getting light in your eyes - so not just inside a bright building with big windows but actually outside. Err on the side of staying up too long so that you save up lots and lots of sleepiness in order to adjust to the local time, rather than going to bed too early before you're sleepy enough. If you want, just stay up that whole first day. Even if you feel sleepy, just stay up during the local day, and so you make sure you have lots of sleep drive saved up for that night."

Try to shift your bedtime little by little to adjust to your new time zone. Takeaway number three - are you flying west or east? If you're traveling west, a short nap on the flight might not hurt since you're going to bed later. Going east, try to stay up on the flight so you can go to bed earlier.
