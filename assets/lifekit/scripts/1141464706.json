I always look forward to it because my tia makes amazing food, because I get to see my cousins and their kids and because it's this steady thing, you know? I can expect it every year. It's tradition, and traditions can be one of the most beautiful things in our lives. They can make us feel like we belong."

      "text": "So we all have traditions in our lives. Some happen on the big holidays and some are a monthly or a weekly thing - Friday night dinner with the family, church or temple. If you want to create traditions that work for you, takeaway one is to identify the traditions you already have and think about how they make you feel. Let's start with the ones you love. What feels good about them? Andrea Bonior says for some people, traditions can be a link between the past, the present and the future. Like, maybe every October 1, you and your parents would set up the neighborhood's spookiest Halloween display, and now you do the same with your kids."

Or my godparents used to do this thing at restaurants. They would sit at the table after dinner and write down what made the meal special on the back of the receipt. They kept the receipts as a memory. That tradition is about noticing joy in the everyday moments. Whatever it is, it helps to know what you like about your existing traditions. Next, start to notice which traditions you dread. Maybe every Fourth of July, you painstakingly recreate your mom's 12-ingredient casserole, but nobody ever helps you. Andrea says if you find yourself preemptively resentful or exhausted when thinking about a tradition, that is good information."

It's a kind of dumpling filled with mung beans and pork, marinated with fish sauce, black pepper and shallots."

It's hard to explain why a combination of rice and pork and shallots and fish sauce and pepper would, like, be anything transcending, but it truly is magnificent."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Diep has fond memories of making banh chung with her grandma, but she felt left out of the celebration as a whole. She was the only person in their family who was openly queer. And there's a Lunar New Year tradition where the adults in the family give the kids red envelopes filled with cash and then wish them well in the new year. Maybe it's, I wish you good grades and happiness. Then the kids say something back like, I wish you good health and prosperity. In some families, you don't transition to an adult who hands out envelopes until you get married. The problem for Diep was, at the time, same-sex marriage was illegal in the U.S. And even if she could have gotten married, her family might not have acknowledged her relationship."

I told you about how Ehime never really felt like she belonged in the Christian church, but she noticed her mom still had some traditional Nigerian spiritual practices."

She learned how to make an ancestral altar, and she became part of the Ifa and Orisha tradition of Nigeria. She found her way back to traditions that felt right in her body. You can also keep your favorite parts of a tradition and leave behind what doesn't work for you. Years after Diep stopped going to Tet, they missed spending the afternoon making banh chung, the experience of cooking as a community and the joy of the Lunar New Year.

Don't do that 'cause it's not like there's one, quote-unquote, \"authentic\" way to uphold a tradition or celebrate a holiday or make a family recipe. Diep gave me an example.

Let your values guide you toward a new tradition. This could be spiritual or not. It could take place on a big holiday or not. It could be a remix of the old or something entirely your own.
