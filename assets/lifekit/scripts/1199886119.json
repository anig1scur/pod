  "intro": "Do you feel like you always need to use GPS to get around? Never quite sure if it's a left or a right turn \u2014 even though you just looked at a map? It can be anxiety-inducing to get around when you don't have a great sense of direction. This episode, experts explain how to gain more confidence while navigating.",

Where is this place? - I plugged the address into my phone - 1021 Dulaney Valley Road - put it on the little holder thingy on the dash, and then - and only then - off I went."

And yet, though I would have loved to have spent this beautiful spring drive with the windows down, bumping Vampire Weekend uninterrupted in the whip, because I don't have a great sense of direction, I was at the mercy of Google Maps."

Yes. Do I usually have my phone on me at all times? Sure, usually. I threw this question at Ben Jiro (ph). He's an outdoors recreation specialist with Cleveland Metroparks, where he helps kids from the city get used to the outdoors, which includes teaching them how to navigate, so obviously, he gets this question a lot."

    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "OK. So that answers the first question of why. Now, what about who? Mary Hegarty, from the spatial thinking lab, says there is some separation between people who are good at navigation and those of us who are bad at it."
    },
    {
      "author": "HEGARTY",
      "text": "I would say it comes from two things. I think probably a certain amount of it is inherited, but I think it largely comes from the types of navigation experiences you've had in your life, you know, how much you have actually been challenged in navigation and how much you've challenged yourself."

    },
    {
      "author": "SPIERS",
      "text": "So there are countries like much of the Scandinavian countries, where there's no real difference between men and women. It's very small. And in school, they learn how to navigate, whereas in various countries around the world where there are big gender discrepancies between what women and men can access for education, health care, travel, you see big differences in navigation skill."

But if that's not you, there are some things you can practice that'll teach you about your own neighborhood, or that you can even apply if you're visiting somewhere. Here's Mary again."

You have to think about, you know, the senses of directions and turning right and left and kind of keeping a sense of a direction in your head as you travel. When you have a GPS on, you're probably not thinking about any of that."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Just a quick note - we're not trying to make anti-GPS propaganda here. They can be a great tool. Mary says the most common use of GPS that people self-report isn't for turn-by-turn directions. It's to get accurate, up-to-date traffic information. But she says an over-reliance on GPS can lead to literally a more narrow view of the world."

    {
      "author": "HEGARTY",
      "text": "If you're just looking at your GPS, you're not paying attention to the broader environment. It maybe, you know, gives you cues of, OK, this - you know, when this is on my right, it means I'm here. And when this is on my left, it means I'm here. That is one of the big pieces of advice I would give to people, is, you know, try navigating without it, especially for routes that you take pretty frequently. And, you know, pay attention to the cues in the environment that help you stay oriented on those routes."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Which brings us to takeaway two - pick out a few big landmarks that you can use to orient yourself. These landmarks can come in different genres. Like, sure, you can use the fourth wave coffee shop down the block or the gas station with the good snacks as street-level landmarks. But the most helpful are the massive faraway ones."
    },
    {
      "author": "HEGARTY",
      "text": "The most useful landmarks are distal landmarks - landmarks that are far away - right? - because - so say something like the bank on the corner. That might be a landmark that helps you turn right if you - you know, you have to turn right on the bank to go to a certain place. But, you know, you're coming up to the bank. It's on your right. And then after you've turned, it's behind you, you know? So its relation to you changes as you navigate. But something that's in the distance, like, for us, the mountains, you know, it's something that's always far away. So it can - it's a better cue to orientation."

So things like dopamine is this well-known molecule, and we get rewarded by something. So if you were in an experience like that where - wow - lots of great things around you. Things that have happened, and you've got this really positive memory, then your brain has got more flexibility to hold onto some of those memories is the way that the research suggests."

    },
    {
      "author": "SPIERS",
      "text": "That is indeed what a lot of expert navigators do, is use narratives to help lock things in because, like I said earlier, it's great if you can memorize street names. But street names are often, like, completely abstract. So the tricks people use are to turn these street names into stories and use whatever tricks, you know, personal stories you can make up."

    {
      "author": "SPIERS",
      "text": "The key to good memory is often, like, how deep you're able to get that information in. So are you just, like, glancing at a street? Or are you looking at it thinking, that doesn't make - why is that here? What's going on? Oh, there's something happening. The more you focus on the detail in things and think about it more deeply, the more like (ph) you are to form a memory of it that lasts."

      "text": "To go back to an earlier example, when Ben mentioned 295, the route that connects Baltimore into Washington, D.C. - those numbers, 295, they don't mean anything to me. I just know it as the highway I take when I have to drive into the main NPR offices in D.C. This process of connecting these ideas is called building a cognitive map."
    },
    {
      "author": "SPIERS",
      "text": "So not literally kind of being able to see a map, but just having an idea of where things are and how they're all connected. And that's used when you're sort of navigating somewhere you've recently been, you've just - learning around - or maybe you've been there for some time, but you're having to really think about how different places are connected."
