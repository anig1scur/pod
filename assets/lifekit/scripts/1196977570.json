      "text": "There are a lot of reasons we scarf down our food - tight deadlines, short lunch breaks, also the great American virtue of productivity that's infiltrated every part of our lives. Like, let me hurry up and eat so I can run more errands. Or if you grew up without enough food, you might have a feeling of scarcity while you're eating. And for some of us, it's just a habit. You know, we eat while we're reading emails or scrolling on our phones."

    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "So first is allocate time to eat and only eat. And make sure your cellphone is not with you or is face down. You're not going to be responding to any messages that come through. And then, to make sure we engage our senses, be with the food and ask yourself, what's on my plate? How hungry am I today in this meal? And notice the taste, really. The recipe that I just cooked - is it too salty? Does it need something else that I can improve it next time? And engage your smell - all your senses - the texture and whatever thought that arose as you eat because there might be some emotional aspects related to the food, and be aware of it."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK, let's say you make a meal that is something that your grandmother used to make for you. And you're eating it and you're tasting - oh, my God, this tastes just like my grandma's stuffed cabbage. You know, like, that's an emotional reaction that you can have to a meal, too, that's positive. But if you pause - rather than just shoveling it in, if you're pausing and saying, like, what do I feel when I bite into this stuffed cabbage, you know, who does it remind me of - does that help?"
    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "Yeah, it does help because it brings back loving, wonderful memories. And the dish that you used as an example is a great, healthy dish. So nowadays, we have to consider sort of the physiological and emotional, psychological aspects of food. But I really worry for America because the amount of ultra-processed, highly refined foods in the market is so huge, and it's easy to get addicted to it. So we have to be very mindful when we yearn for those."

    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "And if you're really longing for potato chips, eat it, but make sure you just take a handful and put it in a nice dish and eat it mindfully to be able to taste the saltiness, the crispiness. And thank the universe for the right climate to be able to have that potato and the manpower that has been engaged in making it available not only at the factory - OK? - but also transportation to get the chips to the supermarket, et cetera. But mindful eating really allows us to become much more aware of what we have, how we get it and what it takes to be able to have that."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "The point you make about taking the potato chips and putting them in a bowl - it gets at another tip for how to eat at a healthy pace, which is take smaller portions to the table, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "Exactly. If you have a whole bag of chips with you and start eating, it's really challenging and difficult to stop because, you know, we love the taste. We love the crispiness. And especially when you may be looking at your cellphone or watching a TV program, you're distracted and you feel good about the crispiness and the taste and you just want more and more without consciously thinking about stopping."

    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "Oh, yes. I think the key with a hurried life when you start to eat is literally stop and take a few breaths in and out. Look at what you are eating and tell yourself, I'm going to enjoy this, and the food will nourish me, both my body and my mind."
    },

    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "I think chewing is important. We don't chew enough, and we just swallow the food. It's harder on our digestion that way. So chewing - our teeth are supposed to help us to break up the food so that it's easier for absorption. So look at your food. Know what you're eating. Take a bite and chew, chew, chew. And then pause a little bit. Drink some water. Or maybe for other cuisines, they may be having soups, OK? So take the time."

      "text": "Right? But sometimes we're in situations where we really don't have much time to eat a meal, especially if we work at a job where we get, like, a 15-minute lunch break. I remember when I worked in retail at a clothing store and I had to clock out, run up to the food court, get on the escalator, wait in line, get my food, eat it, and be back on the floor 15 minutes later. I mean, how? How do you eat at a healthy pace when all you have is 15 minutes?"
    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "In that case, I would split up the food, the meal. Eat at a good pace that you find comfortable. Save it for later for a snack."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. I felt - I always felt like maybe - again, life gets in the way. If you don't have time to prep your meals or - you know, if I could've brought food from home, then that would have saved me some time. But it's tough. It's tough. And sometimes people work at a job where they really have to eat at their desk that day."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHEUNG",
      "text": "Yeah, and that's OK. Just when you're eating at a desk, maybe just make sure that you're not going to be looking at your email."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah. I think there might be an element, too, of setting boundaries with your coworkers - you know, if you have to put an away message on Slack that says, eating lunch."

      "text": "This food is the gift of the Earth, the sky, numerous living beings and much hard work and loving work. May we eat with mindfulness and gratitude so as to be worthy to receive this food. May we recognize and transform unwholesome mental formations, especially our greed, and learn to eat with moderation. May we keep our compassion alive by eating in such a way that reduces the suffering of living beings, stops contributing to climate change and heals and preserve our precious climate. We accept this food so that we may nurture our brotherhood and sisterhood, our family, and realize our ideal of serving all human beings."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK, time for a recap and some extras drawn from Lilian's book with Thich Nhat Hanh. It's called \"Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life.\" Engage your senses as you eat. Notice the sounds, smells, colors, tastes, textures and the emotions that you're feeling. Honor the food. Acknowledge the work that went into putting that meal on your plate. Eat smaller portions. Instead of grabbing the whole bag of potato chips, pour some chips into a bowl and take your time eating them. Savor and chew your food thoroughly. This will help with digestion and will also engage your senses. See if you can make your snack or meal last about 20 minutes, and try not to skip meals. Even if you just have a small bite, give yourself a few minutes to eat and savor."
