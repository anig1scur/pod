Same goes for that dusty bookshelf and the unfolded laundry that's constantly giving me the side eye. That was KC Davis, by the way. She's a therapist. And she wrote a book called \"How To Keep House While Drowning: A Gentle Approach To Cleaning And Organizing.\" She says the problem is that when we think of chores as a moral obligation, but we aren't doing them, it's easy to spiral."

    },
    {
      "author": "DAVIS",
      "text": "Well, the concept is that if you've got a big mess, we don't know where to start. When we do start somewhere, we feel like we work hours at something to see no progress. It feels for some of us like the whole endeavor is just so miserable. It takes a long time to sort of, like, psych yourself up to do it. And so I came up with this method when I was in my early 20s because I felt all of those things. And I just sort of have to tell myself, like, in any room, no matter how many things you think you see, there's really only five things. There's trash, dishes, laundry, things that have a place and things that don't have a place. And for me, if I start at the top of that list and I go category by category, ignoring everything in the room and just looking for that one category of item, it really takes care of a lot of mental blocks that I experience, and I think that's true for a lot of people."

      "author": "DAVIS",
      "text": "No. I - 'cause one of the things that gets us stuck is that we get distracted. So if you - the more times you leave that room, the more likely you are to get distracted on some different project. And the other reason is because I - this is going to get our space livable and functional. Like, I can function with a trash bag sitting by the back door. I can't function with too much trash all around the house. And..."

And I'll do it for, like, 30 minutes and then all of a sudden, the motivation will fly out of my body like it has been exorcized. And so, like, knowing that, like, I'm going to get to a certain point and sort of run out of motivation, I want to get as much done to make the space livable as I can."

      "text": "Yeah, you can do that. You can also get a - I like to have laundry baskets that don't have holes in them because it doubles as lots of other things. And one of the things it works well with is dishes. Like, if you want to carry around a laundry basket and put all the dishes in the laundry basket, you can do that. You can get a small rolling hamper and just pop a piece of hard cardboard on top of it and then just put a basket on top of that and roll that sucker around and collect all those dishes, you know, depending on what works for you, what kind of makes your brain feel like it's on a greased track. The reality is there are going to be ways of doing things that make you feel like you are grinding gears with no oil, where every step of the process kind of feels miserable and you have to force it. I think you should find the way to put the smallest amount of energy to get the most functional result."

      "author": "DAVIS",
      "text": "Yes. So I realized that it's really overwhelming to me to look at a sink full of dishes, that I really dislike from a sensory perspective putting my hands and having to get the utensils from the bottom where they're, like, mixed with all the yucky water and that I couldn't use my sink. Like, I couldn't get a pot underneath to turn the water on. And so I thought, OK, well, I would really like a way to make some of these things easier for me. And so I got this dish rack. And what I started doing was whenever I had a dirty dish, I would stick it on the dish rack dirty. But what happened was at the end of the night when I would go to my sink, not only could I use my sink all day, but I'm looking at this very organized dish rack where it's like plate, plate, plate, plate. Oh, this is all organized. Oh, it would take me just a few minutes to load this up into the dishwasher. And it was just smoother. It was easier. I felt less resistance, less procrastination, less avoidance. And that became, like, a life-changer for me when it came to dishes."

      "author": "DAVIS",
      "text": "So I'll tell you what I do because I am all about simplifying things for my brain. So I've got ADHD. That presents some problems with executive functioning. And one of those things is, like, too many decisions, too many steps, too many - like, my brain goes into gridlock really easily. So here's what I do. I don't have all those categories. And I'm not saying that I don't, but, like, I don't. I just - if it's on the floor, it's going into the hamper, and it's getting washed. I don't care if I wore it once. I don't care if I wore it a thousand times. I don't care if I didn't wear it at all. I just thought I was going to, and I brought it into the living room and set it on the chair. I have to - in my mind, things have to be one step. And the step is if it's not hung up, it's going into the washer. It's getting washed again. And that really simplifies things for me."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. And then last one is things that don't have a place. What do you do with those in the moment? Do you just kind of pile them up, or do you find a place for them? Like, at this point you still haven't thrown away your trash. You haven't put the laundry in the laundry room. You haven't done the dishes. So, like, yeah, what are we doing with the stuff that doesn't have a place?"

What's our body feeling like? What's our concentration level? Because sometimes I just put it aside in a basket and have to do other things - go, you know, throw the trash away. But if I'm really kind of feeling like, no, I want to tackle this, I want to get this done, then I will sort of look inside. And you have to make some decisions. So sometimes the easiest thing is to go, OK, sometimes things don't have a place because, like, you don't need that thing. Is there anything here I can purge or donate or get rid of? And then I go, OK, is there anything in here that kind of, like, has cousins or close friends? And what I mean by that, you know, is if I have a pair of scissors and I don't really have a place where these specific scissors go, well, is there a place in my house where I'm keeping similar items? Like, do I have a drawer where I keep my box cutters? - because I could just add the scissors to that."

You know, it was great to have that dinner party, but, ugh, now I have all these dishes. All right, I - you know, I did a project, but now I have to clean up after myself. I want to flip that. Instead of thinking that care tasks are always cleaning up after ourselves, I want to start thinking of them as forward-facing tasks. You know, I'm going to clean for myself. I'm going to put two dishes into the dishwasher because it would be a real kindness to morning me to be able to just have a clean dish to eat off of in the morning. I want to put my slippers next to my bed at night because I have tile floors, and my feet are cold in the morning, and what a kindness it would be to myself to be able to wake up and put those slippers on before having to walk across the tile. And when you start doing things out of kindness, things start to change. And sometimes I say, I'm not going to even touch these dishes because I deserve rest. And I do that out of kindness, too.

With that in mind, do your housework and self-care in ways that make sense for your brain and your body in general. If you're doing the five things method, go through all the steps before you put away the trash or do the laundry or the dishes. And if you find yourself struggling to do a care task, think about why it's hard for you. Are there changes you could make, ways you could do it differently that might make things easier? Lastly, remember that a messy house is not a moral failure. The dishes aren't going to come alive and say judgmental things to you or make you a 10-course meal. You've been watching too many Disney movies."
