      "text": "...From NPR. Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. So my dad found my Polly Pockets the other day. Yeah, I know; it's a big find. He sent me a picture. I've got all the classics - the pink heart, the big pink star, the pastel green one. I even have one shaped like a koala. I am 35 years old, and I'm pumped to play with these. But also, OK, realistically, what am I supposed to do with them after? Give them back to my parents? Display them? I mean, I don't want to get rid of them. They're precious. But my parents are in possession of a lot more of my precious, semiprecious and not at all precious childhood stuff, and I think they might be ready to offload some of it. The time comes for many of us, often at our parents' insistence, when we are faced with our childhood belongings - preschool artwork, report cards, those shin guards we wore to play soccer in high school. You can definitely throw those out, by the way. For NPR producer Kyle Mackie, that time came this past fall. She's 33. She'd just bought her first house, and her mom was like, hey, why don't you take your crap with you?"

Oh, and by the way, you don't have to get rid of everything."

      "text": "Last September, I flew home to my parents' house in upstate New York to finally, truly go through my childhood stuff. I'd done some purges over the years, but I also stored stuff there in between different jobs, apartments and moves, so the belongings I'd acquired spanned from preschool to my late 20s. The goal was to weed through all of the stuff from my really early years, which I'd never touched, and decide what was going to make the trip out to my new house in Idaho. Renting even the smallest-size moving van was expensive, so that limited how much I was able to keep. And I also didn't want to bother moving a bunch of stuff across the country that was just going to end up taking up space in the garage."

      "text": "You know, we all have a limited amount of space, and when you define the size of the box that you'll use for storage or the amount of space that you'll dedicate to displaying the items that you want to keep, it allows for some space between letting go and keeping."

      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "Amelia Pleasant Kennedy is a professional organizer and certified life coach. She recommends determining how much space you have for storage before you start sorting through your stuff. And that's our first takeaway. Define a limit to how much you're going to keep. Amelia's suggestion is to aim for one box or bin for each chapter of your life. But you also have to listen to your heart. No two organizers are going to perfectly agree on how much is too much, by the way. Lisa Woodruff is the second professional organizer we'll be hearing from in this episode."

    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "Again, think about your living and storage space. Lisa says you just don't want to have to spend all your time maintaining your childhood keepsakes. Next, sort your stuff into categories. That's takeaway No. 2. Separate everything you have to go through into groups, and then tackle them one at a time."
    },
    {
      "author": "KENNEDY",
      "text": "So start by grouping like items with like items - for example, trophies, school records, yearbooks. And then dedicate a certain amount of time to each category."
    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "In other words, create some order out of what could be chaos. Sorting stuff into categories can also help you organize the things you decide to keep. Maybe you were really into musical theater in high school, and you decide to keep a bunch of old programs or special props. Put them in the same box, and separate your other hobbies into different ones. Maybe you need a whole box for sports stuff and another one for model airplanes you used to make with your grandpa. You might want a box for toys and books and other stuff you're planning to keep for future kids. Or you can go with Amelia's time-period suggestion and have one box for elementary school, one for high school and so on. I ended up with a couple boxes of books, one bin for photo albums, a college/study abroad bin and a future-kid bin with baby blankets and other stuff my mom had saved."
    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "Now, setting a time limit for yourself for how long to spend going through each category is really hard, I admit. It took me way longer than expected to go through all of the physical photographs I had. But basically, try not to go so far down memory lane that the rest of your day gets derailed. You also want to start with the easiest decisions first. Maybe you can eliminate an entire category at once if you're ready to let go of all of those Beanie Babies or something. And speaking of Beanie Babies, unfortunately, most collectibles from our childhoods are not worth what we might have hoped they would be on the resale market."
    },
    {
      "author": "KENNEDY",
      "text": "Only the most unique or rare collectibles hold that financial value. So it's important to understand whether you're keeping something out of sentimental value or because you think that it is worth a financial reward. And if you decide to keep something, know that you're committing to investigating that pathway."
    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "That means dedicating more time to research what the object is worth and storing it carefully so that it stays in good condition. Another thing to note here is that it's totally fine to pare down in phases. Pacing yourself might mean working for a couple of hours on Saturday and then a half day on Sunday instead of trying to work through it all in one marathon session. You might spread the process out over several weekends or longer than that. Lisa's home organization program encourages clients to go through every space in their house once a year."

    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "David has studied nostalgia, which it turns out, is quite the complicated mixed emotion. His research has found that people who tend to feel nostalgic often are generally less satisfied with their lives. They find less meaning in their lives, but at the same time, nostalgia can give people a sense of purpose, too, and make you feel more connected to the people you share memories with. Going through your past belongings can put those bonds under the microscope. For example, let's say you come across a photo with a childhood friend who's still in your life today."

Speaking from experience, I'd say definitely be ready for a mix of good and bad feelings to pop up. Just let yourself feel them."
    },
    {
      "author": "NEWMAN",

    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "If and when you start to struggle over decisions about whether to keep or toss something, remember that taking photos is your friend. It's a way to capture special or funny memories but then let the thing go. For example, I took pictures of some journal entries from my time in Germany, a ridiculous self-portrait and a little book I apparently wrote in 1998 called \"My Birds: A True Story.\" Put all the photos you take in a special album on your phone or computer, so you know where they are."
    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "And this brings us to takeaway No. 4 - find a way to transform objects into something that serves you now. A digital copy obviously saves on space. You can also consider ideas like turning old T-shirts into a quilt or making a book of the special holiday cards you want to keep. I actually found some old clothes that still fit, and I put them right back into my wardrobe rotation. Basically, think about how you can use, enjoy or display the mementos you decide to keep."
    },
    {
      "author": "WOODRUFF",
      "text": "Like, if you love it, you should see it. All these treasures and things that you've gotten over the years that you love - display them. Like, if you love them, have them out on display. If you don't want to put them out on display, do you really want them?"

    },
    {
      "author": "WOODRUFF",
      "text": "It is one of his favorite gifts of all time that I did that with his mementos. So I would say, even if you don't have a whole lot of things, as you find things, build yourself a notebook, a scrapbook, a binder. I think that we get a lot of our - not self-esteem - maybe self-esteem, confidence, grounding, our history through our photos and, you know, perfect attendance awards and all these things that seem really, really silly, but they're things that you've done."
    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "Another idea is making a shadow box. It's like a picture frame but with more depth, so you can display clothing, medals or other three-dimensional stuff. Amelia was a ballerina as a kid, so she made a shadow box to frame her very first costume from a performance."

      "author": "KENNEDY",

    },
    {
      "author": "K MACKIE",
      "text": "Coming back to your categories, whether it's basketball jerseys or teddy bears, try to choose just one or two special items to keep from each group instead of saving an entire boxful. I did that when I was weeding through printed photos. I saved just one or two pictures from a sleepover instead of the entire album I put together back in elementary school. I guess getting film developed was a lot cheaper back then."

      "text": "So what to do with all the stuff that doesn't make the cut for repurposing or storage? As long as it's in good enough condition for someone else to enjoy, donate whatever you can. That's takeaway No. 5. Beyond just regular thrift stores, there are tons of donation options out there, from programs that support survivors of domestic violence to refugees and formerly incarcerated people. If you belong to a church, it might take donations. Amelia's client who rode horses was actually able to bring some of her ribbons back to her old barn so they could be redistributed to young riders."

That's our sixth and final takeaway - accept that this process is another part of growing up. There's actually a period of human development called emerging adulthood, which spans the time frame when you leave home for the first time, finish your education and start working. And I'm now moving into full-fledged adulthood somehow. Lisa's been learning about this in a Ph.D. program in general psychology."

When your parents are gone, like, who are you going to turn to? You are now the adult. You're the head of the family, and it's a weight. Like, it is definitely a weight on you. So as you get rid of those things of childhood, or you're ready to get rid of those things of childhood, it is bittersweet because now you know you're the one that's going to be having children or shepherding this family going forward."

Takeaway No. 3 - honor your memories and emotions. Be prepared for a mix of good and bad feelings to pop up and give yourself time to process them. Sharing the experience with someone you trust can help. Takeaway No. 4 - find a way to use, enjoy or display the items you decide to keep. Takeaway No. 5 - donate whatever you can.
