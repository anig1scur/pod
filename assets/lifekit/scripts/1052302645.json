Well, members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed more than 800 published articles and concluded that school-aged children should get nine to 13 hours of sleep. And teenagers should be getting between eight and 10. That's a lot of hours of sleep. When children are sleep-deprived, it affects their overall well-being, like their mental health, physical health and cognitive functioning. And honestly, if children don't get enough sleep, they get cranky. And that's no fun for anyone."

So prioritizing sleep - and I know better things will come along to make sleep seem so mundane - but if you make sleep hygiene habits and routines for your kids, as well as for yourself, consistent and reliable, the kids will excel in school as well as life. And it's never too late to start."

Vyas says a typical bedtime routine could include turning off all screens and devices and any bright lights, winding down and spending quality time with your child. This can be reading a book or singing lullabies, taking a bath and also putting on pajamas and brushing teeth and saying goodnight. And I know that all sounds great. But Vyas warns that parents need to be honest and realistic when creating a routine. Evaluate your daily tasks and come up with a routine that works for you and your family. And that's because a standard bedtime routine might not work for you."

    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "The first one is ensuring adequate sleep, which entails the 10 1/2 to 12 hours a night for school-aged kids. So making sure that they're getting enough sleep, establishing a bedtime routine that's consistent and keeping the wake time same even on weekends - those are the three primary things that, if that's in place, kids will tend to do really well with sleep routine and hygiene."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "So how do you achieve adequate sleep? Here is tip No. 2. I'm sure you've heard it before, but here's a little reminder - put away anything with a screen."
    },
    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "Because the blue light from the devices stimulates the retina and causes wakefulness and doesn't allow the melatonin, the sleep hormone, to elevate and allow the child to feel that sleep pressure. So if there's multiple devices or even lights are on in the house, it makes the child think that it's still daytime and they're not able to get into that sleepy state. So turning devices off, TVs, iPads, phones, all of it at least an hour before bedtime is ideal."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "Maybe you've heard of melatonin, the sleep hormone, but do you know what sleep pressure is? It's basically a fancy word for sleepiness. There's a chemical called adenosine, and this chemical builds up when you're awake. And as it builds and builds and builds because you're awake, eventually, it triggers your body to feel sleepy or, as Vyas calls it, sleep pressure. And what gets rid of adenosine in your body? Sleep. During the wind-down period before bed, parents and school-age children can also benefit from keeping work and play areas separate. This will strengthen the association between the bedroom and sleep, not bedroom and work or bedroom and homework. And Vyas says for anyone looking to get better sleep, it comes down to consistency - waking up and going to bed around the same time every day, which brings us to tip No. 3 - consistency is the magic word. Vyas says in her experience as a sleep consultant, she often has to remind parents of two things - be consistent and make sure your child is getting enough sleep and, again, not just for a day or two. It has to be a routine."
    },
    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "Consistency is key. And often, parents that are researching things online and they'll try things for a day or two and then say, this doesn't work and then try another thing for a day or two, it usually takes being consistent for a period of three to four days before you'll see that change in behavior in the child."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "Also everyone has to be on the same page - all caregivers, parents, grandparents and babysitters."
    },
    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "I usually recommend that everybody participate in the consultation so that everyone understands the theory behind it, as well as the overall plan, so everyone's working for the same goal."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "Another thing that can help you maintain a consistent bedtime is having an optimal sleep environment. If your child's bedroom is ready for sleeping, it can cut down on distractions and build a strong association between their bedroom and sleep. Vyas recommends blocking out any light by using blackout curtains. She says the room should be pitch black with the exception of a nightlight, if necessary."
    },
    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "I like the use of sound machines, especially when the child is first learning to sleep through the night, you know, some sort of sleep proper association that signals to the child that it's time to go to sleep - so either a stuffed animal if they're over a year of age or a lovey or something like that every time the child gets that, the child knows it's time to go to sleep."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "Keeping the room temperature cool is also important. Your body needs to dip down in temperature to achieve sleep, so keeping the room between 67 and 69 degrees is the ideal range to a good night's rest. Another thing that might help keep a consistent bedtime is getting enough exercise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends school-age children should get at least one hour of physical activity a day. When children are active throughout the day, it helps them stay asleep throughout the night. Vyas says parents should also watch out for their children's cues and body language. If you notice they're beginning to get tired or if they've had a long day, don't wait to start the bedtime process."
    },
    {
      "author": "VYAS",
      "text": "If the child is not put to sleep while that sleep pressure is the most prominent and active, then there's a potential for them to no longer be sleepy.

And so that when you go to leave and the child says, oh, I need one more sip of water as you're trying to leave the room, you can say we took care of that already, sweetie. I love you. Good night. I'll see you in the morning."

      "author": "GOMEZ-ALDANA",
      "text": "You can find Vyas' checklist template on the digital version of this story at npr.org/lifekit. You can use the checklist for yourself or to help you create your children's bedtime routine. Another thing to keep in mind is that children might be feeling stress or anxiety, and it's manifesting as uncooperative behavior. Just like adults, children also feel stressed from time to time. I mean, they have school. They're navigating homework, after-school activities, other social interactions. Everything they have going on can at times prevent the child from winding down as they prepare for bed. So if your child feels overwhelmed, have them write all of their worries or tasks on a piece of paper or create a journal where they can write down their thoughts. And once they're written down, you can address them at another time but not during bedtime. Things like meditation can also help. Experts say mindfulness and breathing exercises can calm children down, and they can decrease stress hormones. You can do these exercises together during your bedtime routine. And when you feel like you've tried everything to help your child go to bed and you're still not having any luck with sleep, Vyas says that's when you should consider asking for professional help."

I didn't realize I could have been sleeping so much better so much sooner. It would be nice if parents were sort of more open to accepting that help before it gets to that point and before it's too overwhelming. You don't want nighttime to feel like a nightmare. And if you're struggling every single night, it's a good idea to reach out for help."

      "text": "So let's recap. Tip No. 1 - make a bedtime routine for you and your kids. Set a bedtime and give yourselves enough time to wind down. Spend quality time together and go over your bedtime checklist. Tip No. 2 - put away anything with a screen at least an hour before bedtime because the blue light from the devices could prevent you from falling asleep. Tip No. 3 - it's all about consistency. Children need nine to 13 hours of sleep each night, so make sure your bedtime stays consistent even on weekends. And to help you keep a consistent bedtime, make sure your bedroom is cool and dark. You can use sound machines or white noise to soothe your child and give toddlers a stuffed animal or blanket for security. And tip No. 4 - prepare yourself for the shenanigans. Go through your bedtime checklist together. Once you're done, your child will know it's time to say goodnight. And if you're struggling every night, maybe ask for help. It's never too late to get on track and create healthy sleeping habits."
