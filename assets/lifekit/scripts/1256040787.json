{"title":"Dear Life Kit: I'm jealous of my partner's weight loss","url":"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1256040787","intro":"Author and body-acceptance advocate Katie Sturino joins Ronald Young Jr., host of the podcast Weight For It, to answer listener questions about body image.","transcript":[{"author":"MARIELLE SEGARRA, HOST","text":"You're listening to LIFE KIT..."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"...From NPR."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Hey. It's Marielle. When I was walking home yesterday, I saw a sign outside my local gym. It said something like, got a bikini? Got a body? Then you have a bikini body. I love this idea and the way it pushes back against the common narrative that you're only allowed to go to the pool or show your belly or even exist in the world if your body looks a certain way. Ronald Young Jr. has thought about this topic a lot."},{"author":"RONALD YOUNG JR","text":"So recently, I went to a pool, and there was a picture that, like, came out of me shirtless, and, like, normally, I, like, go through great lengths of only letting people in person see me shirtless. Like, I've never posted a picture online or any of that."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Ronald is the award-winning host of \"Weight For It,\" a podcast that he says unpacks the nuanced thoughts of fat folks and all folks who think about their weight all the time. And he understands that hesitation, the body insecurity people feel in a bathing suit or just walking down the street. But he says there's so much more to a person than their body or the clothes they put on it. So why not try to focus on your presence, your attitude, owning everything about who you are?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I saw this picture, and I was like, you know what? Hell yeah. This is like a..."},{"author":"KATIE STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"So I feel like that was, like, a good opening to hot Ron summer, as I call it."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"That makes me so happy. I like that. Hell yeah, looking at yourself in a photo."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Katie Sturino first found a following online by using her style and voice to promote size inclusivity and body acceptance. She wrote a book called \"Body Talk: How To Embrace Your Body And Start Living Your Best Life,\" and she's also the author of a new novel called \"Sunny Side Up.\""},{"author":"STURINO","text":"My life's work is really to try to convince people that summer is just super fun and you should spend your energy and time making memories with your family and friends and not, like, trying to hide under a towel by the side of the pool."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"On this edition of Dear LIFE KIT, the advice series where reporter Andee Tagle asks experts your burning questions, we are going to get real about body image, self-deprecating comments, how to deal if you're feeling competitive about weight loss and how to shut down a straight-up body image bully."},{"author":"ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE","text":"OK. Question one."},{"author":"ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE","text":"(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, a good friend of mine often makes disparaging comments about her appearance. She often talks about how she feels fat or gross. I think she looks great, but whenever I try to reassure her, she dismisses me. Sometimes she even snaps that I don't understand. My friend is about 15 years older than me, and she also talks about aging in a really negative way. Listening to her comments, she's started to make me feel anxious about my own appearance and the prospect of getting older. How can I tell her I don't want to hear her talk like this? I want to be a supportive friend, especially when she's feeling insecure, but it's starting to negatively affect my own mental health and body image. Signed, Not Negative Nancy."},{"author":"ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE","text":"OK, so my first thought - I think it's totally fair for our writer, Nancy, to not want to be around this negative body talk all the time, but is the best move to maybe start to create some distance? Agree, disagree."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I'm going to jump in and just say that I think there's a couple ways you can handle that. You can say, one, is this a friendship that means a lot to me that I need in my life? And maybe it's a weed that you need to pull out and move on from to protect yourself. But the second thing is you can also offer the attempt at, like, going on a positive journey together and being like, hey, friend, I don't like the way you talk about my friend; would you ever want to, like, try some, like, affirmations together, like, go on a journey together? And see how they react to that."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, I agree with Katie. I think the conversation is probably the first step. Like, hey, you know, when I'm around you and you start talking about, like, what you look like in aging and being fat and all that, like, it puts us both in a place where I don't even know what I'm supposed to do here, how I'm supposed to help. Like, how can we work together to make you feel better leaving the house? Is this about, like, going on a shopping trip, getting some clothes that you feel good in? Is this about, like, going and, like, doing a skin care routine or, like..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Makeover."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...What is this - yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Like, what is it going to take for us to boost your confidence, and how can I be there to support you? And if she does not respond to that, then I would say distance. And the thing is, distance doesn't mean, like, abandonment or neglect. It just means, like, hey, like, if you're going to be over there doing that, I'm going to be over here, like, rooting for you and praying for you from afar. But I can't..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Be in it with you. You know what I mean?"},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah, protect yourself."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"So address the thing directly and then take steps from there."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"And I think another thing that is complicated is sometimes you just don't want to bring - like, it's easy sometimes for you to see the problems that your friend has and the things that they need to fix, as they can see with you from a 30,000-foot view, but sometimes you just don't want to - you don't want to bring all that to their kitchen door."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Like, oftentimes, that just makes you the bad guy and the, can you believe she said this to me? Can you believe this? So sometimes distance is just the only way, and it's so painful for both parties."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, but if you're - and - Katie, yes. And if your friendship can't survive that - if your friendship can't survive..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Correct."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...A tough conversation, then y'all never really graduated into friendship, right?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"It's correct."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"One more point on this that lit up for me was the, I - the, you just don't understand. When a friend has a really different viewpoint from you, especially with their body, when they're like, you just don't get it, what do you do?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I mean, I'm just like, try me. Like, try to either explain it to me or tell me how I can support you, then."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"My takeaway from all this is the reminder that, like, when your friend is having a hard time and that is going to cause inflection points in your friendship, sometimes that will cause your friendships to, like, bend and grow."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Sometimes that'll cause them to break. And either way, that's OK. We're going to learn from that, right?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"OK, question two."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, my partner and I have both been on GLP-1 medications for about eight months. She's losing weight so much faster than me, and it's hard not to compare my body to hers. How can I manage my jealousy while still celebrating the changes in her own body she's happy to see? Signed, Competitive Companion."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"OK. I think a lot of people could identify with feelings of body jealousy, body envy and how much more complicated those emotions can be when they're within your own home and within your own romantic relationship. Is it OK to voice those feelings?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"So I'm hearing some, like, things here, like the word celebration. And I had a friend who went on a GLP-1, like, two or three years ago, and every pound she lost, she would call me and be like, yes. Like, oh. Like, I can fit into this now. It was so triggering and jarring for me. And then..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yes."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...I finally had to be like, hey, I don't want to hear about this. This is not the way I think about weight. And, like, it's not a celebration. It's just, like, a number changing. Like, it's so much more neutral for me. So it sounds like maybe the partner in this situation is being a little toxic..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yes."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...In their weight loss."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I think you're right, Katie. First of all, I just want to say - and I hope this goes far and wide - weight loss is not something to be celebrated, period."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"No. No."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I don't ever think it is. And I - to really nail this point home, I lost my mom last year, and before she died, she lost a ton of weight. And it was scary for us because we were like, oh, no, this is indicative of something horrible happening to her. And I realize that every time we see somebody losing weight, our assumption is that something good is happening to them. And that is a terrible assumption..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Especially when it comes to what we are saying about what that means for health generally. Oh, losing weight always means that you're getting health care."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"And we know..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...That, in fact, that's not the case. And so..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...For in this case, if we're saying that we're - how can I be happy for her? I'm like, well, you could be happy for if her weight loss is attached to something else. Like, for instance..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...If I ever wanted to lose weight, it's like, well, I don't want to be out of breath on the stairs. If I turned to my partner and said, hey, I'm not out of breath on the stairs anymore; this has been great; I can go on long walks and hikes with you, and I feel a lot better and it's not attached..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...To, like, what I look like in my clothes or how I feel..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...About myself, then it'd be totally - then I'm like, yes. Now we have something to actually celebrate. I don't think that anyone who has lost a massive amount of weight has done - that is not your biggest accomplishment in life."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"No."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"There are other things that you've done that I will be prouder of you for than for losing weight."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I have recently lost weight, and the comments I get about my body are infuriating. And people don't understand why I would not want these comments."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I don't want them. And people being like, you're - you look so happy. Like, you look so healthy. And I'm like, you don't know anything about it. Like..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...That's not an indicator of happiness or of health. Like, it's - it infuriates me to, like, a real core point."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"The other thing, Katie, is I think it robs you of everything that you've accomplished while fat. You know what I mean?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Like, it's..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Oh. Oh, yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Like, how dare you come to me..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Oh, yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...And say, oh, you're doing this, and, wow. And I'm like, what all has Katie accomplished as a fat person? That is the things we should be celebrating, and that she's continuing her journey to being awesome. And, like, think about all the people that love you, Katie, because you're Katie and not because you were fat or thin. And so then all these people come along to be like, oh, yeah, now you're really going to get it. It's like, no, I'm - I was getting it already. You know what I mean?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Ron, I'm going to cry. That is the - that is it. And, like, this is not a podcast about me and my personal journey, but that is - that - you just said it. I mean..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...You said it."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"So this is great advice for our listener Competitive Companion. I wonder if there's anything else you have for us on the dynamic between Competitive Companion and her partner about the conversation that they need to have at home."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I think they just need to reassess their actual goals. It cannot just be about aesthetics. It has to be about, like, something else. And I don't know what that something else is for them. Maybe it is a walking goal. Maybe it is a marathon thing - whatever. But it cannot just be attached to a number and an aesthetic. Revisit it together and decide what that is for both them as individuals and as a couple."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Absolutely. OK, question three."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, my brother-in-law likes to call people by funny names. His name for me blends my name with the word anorexia, even though I've never been underweight or experienced disordered eating. I've asked him to stop. His response? Can't you take a joke? Recently, my sister baked a cake and offered me a slice, which I accepted eagerly. My brother-in-law leaned over and said, you don't want to eat that. You'll just have to stick your finger down your throat later. My daughters, who are 13 and 11, looked shocked and confused, but no one else in my family reacted. Now they're not interested in attending events on that side of the family if he's going to be there. I'm torn between wanting to participate in family events and not wanting to subject myself and my daughters to this kind of teasing and my family's normalization of it. What can I do? Signed, Bullied by Brother-in-Law."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Hey, yo."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"This..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, go ahead, Katie. Go ahead, Katie, 'cause I'm fired up. Go ahead."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Guys, I'm so fired up about this. This made me so mad because, one, it's men thinking that they can get away with, like, saying [expletive] and, like, not realizing that there's consequences and just being such dumb [expletive] about stuff. And then, two, it's so hard because that relationship with your sister is so delicate, and your sister is not always going to be able to come to your side. Like, your sister might have to side with spouse due to, like, peace in the home, and that is really hard to accept. But your brother-in-law is an [expletive]."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"If this is what he's saying that's funny, what is he saying that's not funny? Like, what is your sister dealing with?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"No, that's what I'm saying - is that's also an indicator of, like, maybe in the home, like, what your sister is dealing with behind closed doors. But that's not something you can force a friend, a family member or anyone in your life to realize. They have to come to that stuff on their own. But you can make the choices. Like, I love that she talked to her kids about it. And I really love that she's making the - that they're kind of like, I don't really want to do that. So maybe it's you have to reconstruct the family dynamic where you're just doing, like, ladies stuff, and you're just doing stuff with, like, sister, mom and kids."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I would say, like, this is a brother-in-law. So I'm like..."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...I feel like, at some point, you have to say..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"It's going to be an ex-brother-in-law."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, pretty much. Like, you could even say to your sister or someone else - be like, yo, you need to watch your boy. Like, that's - 'cause that's what I would say. If this was a friend that you were bringing around and they kept doing stuff like this, Katie, I'd turn to you and be like, yo, you better get your boy 'cause, like, my kids are here. He's over here saying dumb stuff. He's got about one or two more times before you're not going to see us anymore, period. Like, that's the - the leverage that you have is your attendance at these events, just to say, if Frank (ph) keeps running his mouth, you will not see me at these things anymore, especially with my 13- and 11-year-old kids who are, like, well beyond the age of reason at this point, like, now..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Have their own opinions on what this is like. And he's saying dumb stuff to their mother. Like, I don't like that. That's - what are you talking about here?"},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Katie, how would you step in in this scenario?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I - so here's the thing, is that what I - I'm coming in with the perspective of when a woman - 'cause again, if this is what he's saying in public, what's he saying in private?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Correct."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I know that a woman who is most likely being emotionally abused at home is unable to defend herself and often will stick up for the husband. And then that is so disheartening to see. So it's like I almost don't want to put that person in the position to..."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Oh, the worst."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...Have to do that."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"That's fair."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah. So that's like - it's, like, I would talk directly - I would take the bully on. And I wouldn't do it in public. I would do it in private because the bully's going to want to, like, challenge you in public. So it's like you almost have to take the bully in private and be like, hey, like, what's up with this? Like, why do you talk to me like this?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I agree with that. And I think if you're going to take the bully on, I think you have to answer to its questions. Can't you take a joke? No, I'm sensitive."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"No, I can't."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yep."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"No, you can't make..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yep."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Those stupid jokes anymore. And you should feel uncomfortable around me about making those jokes."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"And it should be weird for you. And if you don't want to come to family events because I'm there, that's perfectly fine 'cause I feel like that's - if we're leaving especially the sister out of this completely, then I feel like - I mean, then going straight at the bully and saying like, stop doing this, and if you do it, I'm going to call it out every time, and every family event is going to be awkward 'cause I'm going to be in the middle of the table. Like, Katie, I know you said do it in private, but I'd be at the middle of the table like, what that means? What that means? What you saying?"},{"author":"STURINO","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"What you talking about? What do you mean? Explain that to my 13- and 11-year-old what do you mean by that. Like, explain that to me. That doesn't - like, keep going. And I'm going to make it real awkward for everyone so that every time I show up, they're like, oh, no, Ronald's causing a scene again. Like, yes, I certainly am. I think - and you know why I'm thinking this way, Katie and Andee? I feel like I shouldn't have to be the one to no longer go to family events because of someone else's poor behavior."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Totally. Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"That's not fair."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I agree."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"I'm like, why do we now have to kind of, like, move like spies?"},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Tiptoe around."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yes."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"When you're the one..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Being the jerk. And I guess..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...My question is, is there a way that she can, like - and I don't know what her marital situation is. But if her spouse is around, is there a way they can join forces and be like, hey, Frank, like, we'll jump you."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Talk to Brian (ph)."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"You know what I mean?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Watch out. Like, don't walk to your car alone. We'll jump you."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I don't know. She didn't mention a spouse, and now I'm like, I need to know, like, who's she coming in with?"},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, 'cause now there should be two divorces..."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"...Happening if..."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yes."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"And also I just - I love to plug on divorce..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...In general, and just say, like, let's - I think we should just normalize not pushing through and just push - and just leaving more often because I think sometimes, we overestimate the bond of marriage. Is that bad to say? But I'm very pro-divorce."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"(Laughter) I understand your perspective, and I support it."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Do you think? Thank you (laughter)."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Ronald, Katie, before you go, we ask every guest of Dear LIFE KIT for their best piece of advice. I would love to hear yours."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"OK. I never know if people are going to understand what this means, but ride the horse in the direction it's going. So..."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Ooh, that's good."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"...If it's not flowing, if it's not, like - if it's not working, like, you do not have to stick with it."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I love that a lot."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah. For me, it's just real cliche. Don't give up. I think that the you in the past would be very proud to see where you are now and so don't give up."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"Ride the horse where it's going. Don't give up on said horse."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, that's good."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I think we've solved it all."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"(Laughter)."},{"author":"TAGLE","text":"I think so. Ronald, Katie, this was such a pleasure. It really was."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"STURINO","text":"I had so much fun."},{"author":"YOUNG","text":"Yeah, this was great."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That was LIFE KIT reporter Andee Tagle talking to Ronald Young Jr. and Katie Sturino."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.
