And, look, when you go home to your parents' house, whether it's for a few days or way longer, it is easy to regress to the teenage version of yourself."

Accepting that she's in a very different place in life has been a challenge. But the creators community on TikTok has helped her to overcome some of the expectations that she's placed upon herself.

During business hours, work from the office or a co-working space, a coffee shop or a local library. In terms of recreation, continue to take that spin class with your favorite instructor on Saturday mornings, if you can afford it. Grab dinner with your sister circle on Friday and meet up with the run club on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Just because you're living with parents doesn't mean that you have to be a recluse."

I mean, you're living through a tough moment personally and financially, but you still want to offer your parents a gesture of thanks. If it feels like you're being too much of a mooch, then your parents might begin to feel like you're taking advantage or, worse, they might become a bit resentful. And being a source of resentment is not a good look. If you have a few extra minutes in the day, wash the pots. Trust me, it will make life much smoother. Extra points if you wash the pots consistently."

After getting past that disclaimer, as a couple, you'll need to find ways to maintain that relationship or it will inevitably end. But what if your parents might have some super strong opinions about your romantic life due to culture, religion or other ideologies? Of course, you'll want to be respectful because you're living in your parents' house. But, lest we forget, you're grown too. Private, quiet moments are so special. But what happens if your person wants to sleep over?"

      "author": "LEON",
      "text": "It's important to continue tending to your love life while also compromising with your parents. So for more uninterrupted private time, go to your partner's house or consider going on a vacation or even a staycation together. If all else fails, grab a hotel for the night, if you can swing it. For those who aren't partnered and want to date, continue to put yourself out there. Stay single and ready to mingle. Go on dates despite living at home. And if, for some odd and super controlling reason, your parents don't agree with your popping dating life, then perhaps you should agree to disagree, which leads us to our final takeaway. Don't be afraid of conflict, and seek professional help when things get too emotional."

Takeaway two - set healthy boundaries and establish a routine. Yes, you will need privacy and alone time. Also, keep your gym dates and your daily meditation - period. Takeaway three - find a creative way to contribute to the household. You might not be making a lot of money or any money at all. Either way, find an opportunity to add value.
