      "text": "Hey, everybody, it's Marielle. There's this weird thing that happens to a lot of us. We might be perfectly comfortable talking to one person or within a small group of people. But if we find ourselves needing to speak to a crowd, especially up on a stage or behind a podium, we freeze. Anxiety takes over. And next thing you know, you're up there, saying words, but your voice is shaking. You're sweating through your shirt, and you're not sure you're delivering your message. By the way, this does happen to me, even though I host a show at NPR. When I was walking down the aisle to officiate my brother's wedding, I was so nervous that the thought popped into my head - I could make a run for it. They'll never find me. I pushed through, and the wedding went forward."

      "text": "So here's the thing. At some point in your life, you will probably speak in public, in front of people, about something you care about. Maybe that looks like going up to a podium at a city council meeting and making your point about a particular topic or a toast at your best friend's wedding or a eulogy at the memorial service of someone you loved. In those moments, you want to clearly convey your message and be yourself and feel comfortable. And the idea of speaking in front of people can be nerve-wracking. I mean, you're often physically isolated, getting up on a platform or behind a podium with all eyes on you."

And, no, that name is not about warm bread. It's actually an organization that helps people practice public speaking. They have 14,000 Toastmaster clubs all over the world, so there's probably one near you. Rachel says there's a specific technique she likes to use to help her feel less nervous, and that's to focus on the filler words she's using - words like um and you know - and to try not to use them. Now, this technique might not be for everyone, but Rachel says it helps."

    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "I want to dive into this concept of what makes a good speaker. Critiquing how a person talks often masks sexist, racist, and homophobic ideas, just to name a few. Often, we're told that being a good speaker means - and I'm doing air quotes here - \"speaking proper English\" or not speaking with vocal fry. And I think all of this is code for saying that a good speaker is a white, cisgender, straight male, and everyone should sound like that. This idea is harmful and dehumanizing, and it impacts people, especially anyone who doesn't have that identity and speaks in different ways. So I want to acknowledge that if you have some feelings about your own voice, there are some big forces at play that have influenced how you feel about your own instrument."

      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",
      "text": "If you feel like, before you speak, you need a better credential or a more mature voice or a lower-octave voice, I would say that sounds like an internal gatekeeper. And unfortunately, no matter how many degrees you get or how much you alter or modulate your voice, that gatekeeper will never tell you that you're good enough to speak. So we got to get rid of that internal gatekeeper."

You are an expert on your life and experiences, and you've got some expertise on the subject you're talking about. Plus, most of us have already done some public speaking. For example, in school, you probably spoke in your classrooms in front of other students and teachers. Lauren says we've also heard a lot of public speaking. She says, growing up, she listened to sermons every Sunday at church."
    },
    {
      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",
      "text": "And a sermon is, of course, a kind of speech. And the beauty of many churches, including the one I grew up in, is that the congregation gives real-time feedback in the form of clapping or snapping or saying Amen. It's a very responsive format. So I got to grow up learning from both the pulpit, but also the pews around me, about what kind of speech moves people."

      "text": "If my audience could only walk out of this room with one thing, what would that one thing be? It's kind of like the thesis of an essay, but it doesn't have to be this intellectual idea. It can also be a feeling - like wanting your audience to walk away feeling appreciated more than anything else."

One day, I want to give a speech about how I love making paper collages, and my core message would be to inspire audience members to make their own collages at home. Lauren says identifying your core message is key because other decisions will pop up that relate back to your core message."

      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",

In this case, you know a lot before you ever start writing. You know about the audience. You know the requested subject matter. You know something about the context. And so I'd advise this person to just get as much of that down on paper as they can."

      "author": "NORRIS",

While you're at it, write down what you know about your audience and the context of your speech. The point of jotting all this down is to get the ball rolling because these logistical details will help shape your presentation."
    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Now let's talk about takeaway No. 4, and that's to come up with what Lauren calls a bunch of sticky stories.

And you want to make sure your sticky stories relate to your core message."

    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Lauren says lean on that idea of show, don't tell. So let's say you want to give a presentation about country musician Loretta Lynn. Instead of saying she cared for her friends, say she was known to call up her friends, like musician Tanya Tucker, and ask them if they needed money. So be specific and detail-oriented. Once you've got your core message and some sticky stories, Lauren likes to make an outline."
    },
    {
      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",
      "text": "And I think you do want to find a structure for the presentation, which you can think of as kind of, like, a roadmap for yourself and for the audience, where the main points are, like, big landmarks. And then the stories and the details will make it vivid and textured, and you can sort of figure out how all of these things fit together, what might not make the cut in the end because you have limited time."

      "author": "NORRIS",

    {
      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",
      "text": "I think that, actually, a pretty big part of writing for the ear, I've learned, is trusting short, simple words and short, simple sentences. You don't have to use the biggest word you know in a speech. And, yeah, the short, simple ones are often the most powerful."
    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Most of us learn to write in school, where we wrote for the eye, meaning someone read our words on the page. In speeches, we write for the ear, meaning people will listen to our words. So the big difference is that, when you write for the ear, you want to keep your sentences short and sweet and write conversationally. As for how you write your speech, Lauren has no hard and fast rules, like bullet points versus memorization or using small cards versus paper. She says, figure out a system that works for you. Once you've got your final version of your speech and you do end up printing it out, use a font that's big enough to read, and really space things out on the page."
    },
    {
      "author": "DOMINGUEZ CHAN",
      "text": "And then, finally, try to have text on just the first two-thirds of the page so that it's easier to look up and make eye contact if you're, you know, at a podium."

    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Lauren says you can even get creative, especially if you get nervous. She says put a special note at the top of the page or, you know, a sparkly heart sticker to remind yourself that you've got this."
    },
    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "OK. Now it's time to practice. And that's takeaway No. 6. Hey, I find it comforting in remembering that professional musicians practice their scales every day. And world-class athletes do their basic drills and practice techniques all the time. So if you want to improve at public speaking, practice public speaking to train your body and your mind. And even though public speaking seems like a solo event, it's not. Public speaking is about connecting with other people, so Lauren says you want to engage with other people throughout the process."

When you give a speech at Toastmasters, it's someone's job in the club to listen to your content and give you feedback, and then it's another person's job to listen to your grammar and give you feedback. And someone else listens to the number of times you use filler words, like um, and let you know that number. And these are things you could also ask your friend to listen for, too. The whole point is for you to get concrete feedback so you can improve. Rachel's advice for anyone who wants to get better at public speaking is to find a supportive group of people."

      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "When you start the writing process, write for the ear. That's takeaway No. 5. That means keep your sentences and your words short and sweet. And if you get stuck, here's a hack I love. Close your eyes and imagine you're talking with your friend who's right in front of you. Then, actually say what you want to say to them out loud. Then write down what you said word-for-word."

    {
      "author": "NORRIS",
      "text": "Takeaway No. 6 - you're going to want to practice because that can help you feel less nervous or anxious. So practice in the mirror, record yourself and listen back. Get feedback from someone supportive or go to a place where people practice public speaking, like a Toastmasters club. Even though public speaking can seem like a solo activity, it's not. Lean on people throughout the process to help you practice and fine-tune your presentation. And remember, the whole point of giving your speech is to be present and be yourself and share your message so you can connect with other people."
