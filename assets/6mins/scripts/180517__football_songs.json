I'm Dan."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Now, Neil, do you like going to live football matches?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes, I love it."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Is it better than watching them on TV?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you don\u2019t really see as much as you do on TV, but then on TV you don\u2019t really feel the atmosphere. You can\u2019t sing along with the chants and songs at home."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, it\u2019s good you mentioned the songs and chants because that is today\u2019s topic. It seems that for some football clubs, the atmosphere in the stadiums is becoming a bit \u2018quiet\u2019. Now, before we look at this topic in more detail, here is today\u2019s quiz. As we are talking about football, in which decade was the first ever international football played?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I could be wrong but I think it was before the turn of the century, so I\u2019ll say the 1890s."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, we'll see if you're right or not later in the show. Now, songs and chants are part of the experience of football matches. But where do they come from? What are they about? Here\u2019s Joe Wilson from BBC Sport. Which team name does he mention?"},{"author":"Joe Wilson","text":"Some songs can be witty , honed specifically to celebrate a certain player or moment in a club\u2019s history. Others rely more on a hypnotic repetition of syllables. U-NI-TED, for example."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So, which team does he mention?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, he used the syllables from United. This isn\u2019t one team as there are quite a few professional teams in Britain that have United in their names, in fact there are over a dozen. Perhaps the most well-known though would be Manchester United."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I think fans of Welling United might argue with you about that! Anyway, what did Wilson say about the nature of football songs?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"He said they could be witty . Witty means funny but in a clever way. He also said that they could be honed ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Honed is an interesting word here. Something that is honed is carefully crafted, skilfully created and developed over a period of time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When it comes to witty football songs Wilson describes them as being honed to be about a particular player, or a moment in a club\u2019s history. But these aren\u2019t the only kinds of songs. Another kind of song he describes is the hypnotic repetition of syllables."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Something that is hypnotic repeats again and again \u2013 like a magical spell or chant. What\u2019s interesting is that in football songs words can have more syllables than you would expect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes, for example, let\u2019s take England. Two syllables, right?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Right!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wrong! At least in a football stadium it becomes three syllables. Eng \u2013 ger \u2013 land, Eng \u2013 ger \u2013 land \u2026"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Alright! Thank you! Let\u2019s listen to Mr Wilson again."},{"author":"Joe Wilson","text":"Some songs can be witty , honed specifically to celebrate a certain player or moment in a club\u2019s history. Others rely more on a hypnotic repetition of syllables. U-NI-TED, for example."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Now, apparently, in many stadiums, the crowds aren\u2019t singing as much as they used to. Some managers have complained that the fans are too quiet and that this has a negative effect on the players. So what are some of the reasons for this? Here\u2019s BBC Sport\u2019s Joe Wilson again. How many reasons does he mention?"},{"author":"Joe Wilson","text":"The decline in singing may be explained by changing demographics in football attendance. Older supporters, more expensive tickets. Or by stadium design. All-seater arenas may discourage the instinct to stand up and sing."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So, what reasons did he give for the decline in singing, for the fact that singing is getting less common."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He gave a number of reasons. He talked about the change in demographics . Demographics refers to a section of the population that do a particular thing. It can refer to age groups or wealth, for example."},{"author":"Dan","text":"What Wilson says is that the members that make up a football crowd are changing. They are older and wealthier, and perhaps that is a demographic or group that is less likely to sing in public."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Another reason he gives is that sitting down might also discourage people from singing. If something discourages you, it makes you not want to do it. Most stadiums in the UK have to have seats and maybe singing is something that people feel happier doing when they are standing up."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well the final whistle is about to blow on today\u2019s programme. Before that though, here\u2019s the answer to our quiz question. I asked you when the first international football match took place."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I took a guess with the 1890s."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And that's a red card, I'm afraid, Neil. The first international football match took place in the 1870s between England and Scotland."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, come on ref!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And now, to take us to the whistle, let's review today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The first word we had was witty . A kind of humour that is smart and clever."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Then we had honed for something that is crafted and improved over time. A bit like my physique. I\u2019ve been honing my body in the gym."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Really? Are you being witty ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I wasn\u2019t trying to! Anyhow, we then heard about hypnotic repetition to describe the effect of thousands of people repeating the syllables of a football team over and over and over and over and over and over and over\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Dan! OK, Dan! We use the phrase a decline in to say that something is getting less."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Demographics refers to a group or section of the population that is involved a particular activity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally we had the verb discourage for something that makes us less likely to do something."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, that is it for this programme. If you\u2019re not interested in football, I hope we didn\u2019t discourage you from listening again!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed, I hope it doesn\u2019t lead to a decline in our audience. We want to have as wide a demographic as possible."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So with that in mind, don't forget to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course, on our website \u2013 bbclearninenglish.com! Bye!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["","Dan","Neil","Joe
