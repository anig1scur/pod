I\u2019d much rather be socialising and visiting friends."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If, like Rob, the idea of being alone does not appeal to you, it might be hard to understand why anyone would choose to be a hermit.

Christopher Wright may be an extreme example of someone seeking solitude, but there are many other motivations for becoming a hermit."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Some people are looking for peace and silence, and for others it\u2019s about being closer to God, focusing on what\u2019s inside and finding a sense of joy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Meng Hu is a former librarian who now runs a website all about hermits. He says that in ancient times, many Chinese hermits seeking solitude were followers of the philosopher, Confucius."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Here\u2019s Meng Hu talking about Confucius to BBC World Service programme, The Why Factor:"},{"author":"Meng Hu","text":"His dictum was something like, \u2018When the Emperor is good, serve. When the Emperor is evil, recluse\u2019. And so over a thousand years at least there were a lot of recluses, a lot of educated men who simply couldn\u2019t tolerate any more evil \u2013 they simply dropped out and they would migrate to small villages, to farms."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Meng Hu mentions Confucius\u2019s dictum . A dictum is a short statement or saying which expresses some wise advice or a general truth about life."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Confucius\u2019s dictum advised that when the Emperor was evil, people should become recluses \u2013 people, like hermits, who live alone and avoid contact with others."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the interview, Meng Hu uses \u2018recluse\u2019 as a verb \u2013 to recluse - but this is very uncommon. A more modern way of saying this is, to drop out \u2013 to reject the normal ways society works and live outside the system."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A bit like the hippies in the 1960s, you mean?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. Although most hippies weren\u2019t looking for isolation, they did have something in common with hermits \u2013 the desire to challenge society\u2019s rules and conventions."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Someone who combines the hippie and the hermit is Catholic writer, Sara Maitland. Part of a long tradition of Christian hermits, Sara spent forty days and nights alone on the Isle of Skye, seeking God in the silence of the remote Scottish island."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For her, the magic of silence is something to be embraced and taught to children. Here she explains more to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Why Factor:"},{"author":"Sara Maitland","text":"Most people first encounter silence in bereavement , in relationship breakdown and in death and that seems to be about the worst place to start. People say, \u2018But what should we do?\u2019 Never, ever use \u2018Go to your room on your own\u2019 as a punishment. You use it as a reward \u2013 \u2018Darling, you\u2019ve been so good all day, you\u2019ve been so helpful, why don\u2019t you go to your room for half an hour now and be on your own?\u2019 A treat ! A reward!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Sara says that most people experience silence after a bereavement \u2013 the death of a relative or close friend."},{"author":"Neil","text":"She also thinks that parents should never tell their children, \u2018Go to your room!\u2019 as a punishment. Instead, being alone should be a treat \u2013 a reward or gift of something special and enjoyable. That way, children learn that being alone can actually be enjoyable."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019m still wondering about that American, Christopher Wright \u2013 I suppose living alone in the woods was a treat for him\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I suppose so - but why did he need an alarm clock?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah yes, your quiz question, Neil. I thought maybe it was to remind him to hide his tent. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well incredibly, Rob, the answer was c) to wake him up at the coldest part of the night so he didn\u2019t freeze to death!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s someone who really wants to be left alone!
