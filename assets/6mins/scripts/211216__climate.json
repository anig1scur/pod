It\u2019s hard to feel positive when you hear about climate change, don\u2019t you think, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes. According to the UN\u2019s COP26 conference, we\u2019re heading for a catastrophic global temperature rise of three degrees by the end of this century\u2026 Fires are blazing from the Amazon to the Arctic... And even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels tomorrow, it would take decades to feel the effects. It\u2019s all very depressing!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I agree, but there is hope that catastrophes can be avoided thanks to some amazing ideas by some very imaginative scientists. In this programme, we\u2019ll be discussing geoengineering \u2013 the name for a collection of new scientific plans to remove carbon from the atmosphere and stop global warming."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Also called \u2018climate repair\u2019, geoengineering is still in the experimental stages. Some technologies are controversial because they interfere with natural climate systems, and others may not even be possible."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think most people would say the answer is c) The Beatles"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, we\u2019ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, throwing diamonds in the sky might sound crazy but it\u2019s far from the wildest idea scientists have thought up to decarbonise the planet."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oceans hold sixteen times more carbon than the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and could hold even more if the fish and plankton living there had more available nutrients \u2013 food that animals and plants need to grow."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But how to provide these nutrients? Believe it or not, one answer involves - you guessed it - whale poo"},{"author":"Sam","text":"David King chairs the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University. He explained how his unusual idea would work to BBC World Service programme, Discovery:"},{"author":"David King","text":"Image now a pod of whales all coming up and pooing in the same area of the ocean. This could be in an eddy current, and it could lead to something like 10,000 to 20,000 square kilometres being covered in nutrients, including iron. And as we know from observations today, within three months that region is chock-a-block with fish."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Whales live in groups called pods. They swim up to the ocean surface to poo, and this poo can be spread in an eddy \u2013 a large current of water moving in a circular motion, like a giant whirlpool."},{"author":"Sam","text":"As a result, huge areas of the ocean are covered in nutrients, and become chock-a-block with fish \u2013 an informal way to say \u2018full of fish\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Listen as geochemist, Professor Rachael James, explains her idea to BBC World Service\u2019s, Discovery:"},{"author":"Rachael James","text":"For every tonne of rock that\u2019s mined, only a very tiny proportion, a couple of grams of that, is actually diamond. The rest of it is effectively waste. So, mine waste material is potentially a really great source of material that could be repurposed for enhanced rock weathering, and I think that\u2019s really good because it creates a circular economy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Mining for diamonds creates tonnes of waste rock which could be used to capture carbon. Professor James wants to repurpose this rock \u2013 to find a new use for it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not only would this lock more carbon, it also creates a circular economy \u2013 an economic model which involves sharing, reusing and recycling products for as long as possible to avoid waste and to reduce levels of carbon."},{"author":"Sam","text":"While these ideas might sound strange, they\u2019re all theoretically possible. And looking to science for positive solutions reminds some people of the early ecological movement which started in the 1960s and now, fifty years later, is being taken seriously."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Speaking of the 1960s, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question, Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was, of course\u2026 the correct answer!
