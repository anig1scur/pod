I'm Sophie\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"What are you reading?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A news blog \u2013 it says here that the fossil of a two-headed dinosaur has been discovered in Greece. Look! Look at this picture!"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Honestly, Neil, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet! This story is from one of those fake news websites that float about on social media. And you aren't the only one to get taken in \u2013 even serious news channels report these types of stories as if they were true."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Taken in means fooled by something. Well, I must admit, I did believe it. And I didn't know that fake \u2013 or pretend \u2013 news sites existed. How am I supposed to know what's fake and what's real? So many extraordinary things happen!"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"That's a good question, and actually, digital news and its effect on traditional newspapers is the subject of today's show. The thing is, if you read a traditional print newspaper like I do, you'd find stories that are more reliable \u2013 ones you can trust."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, enjoy your traditional print newspaper while you can, Sophie, because they're going to disappear pretty soon \u2013 the same way as the dinosaurs!"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Hmm. It is true that print newspapers are feeling the pinch these days \u2013 and that means not making enough money. But I will miss them if they go. Which brings me on to today's quiz question. Neil, how many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it\u2026 a) 70,000? b) 700,000? Or c) 7 million?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I'll go for a) 70,000. It can't be much more than that, surely."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital news \u2013 that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one \u2013 given the mass of information available on the web. So maybe you should tell us about the advantages, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you can access news 24/7 \u2013 and search for it on your phone or tablet without having to flip through pages of stuff you aren't interested in. It isn't all in black and white, it isn't all about reading \u2013 you can watch and listen too. And make comments of your own."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"OK. Well, let's listen to Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University, to see what he thinks is important in journalism nowadays."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet, on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television, or on radio. What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Tim Luckhurst there. He says that news will be successful on any platform \u2013 digital or traditional \u2013 so long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're objective it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you rant you speak in an angry opinionated way about something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, newspapers need to make money in order to pay their journalists. And with circulation falling dramatically, they need to find other ways to make newspapers pay."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"A newspaper's circulation is the number of copies it distributes per day. Well, selling more advertising space is one way, isn't it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, but many advertisers are choosing to use digital platforms because they reach a wider and more targeted audience. And this is one reason why digital news is taking over \u2013 it can pay for itself through advertising."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"I wouldn't mind paying more for a newspaper if I knew the quality of journalism is good."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But increasingly people are expecting good quality journalism for free."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Newspapers have been around since the invention of the printing press, and as chronicles \u2013 or written accounts \u2013 of people's lives, are an important historical resource. Let's listen to Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk talking more about this."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk During the First World War local papers always printed In Memoriam columns where they'd list local dead. What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines \u2013 not very long \u2013 but they're really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Deceased is another word for dead \u2013 in this case, it refers to the British soldiers who died in the First World War."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Local papers, at the time, printed poems written by the families of the dead men. Those poems, captured in print, are an important historical record of the time."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Indeed. Now, remember, Neil, I asked you: How many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it\u2026 a) 70,000, b) 700,000 or c) 7 million?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I remember. And I said 70,000."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well, I'm sorry Neil, but you are wrong. The answer is actually c) 7 million. But the numbers are falling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that's still a few million more than I thought. Now, I think it must be time to hear the words we learned today. They are: taken in fake reliable feeling the pinch objective rant circulation chronicles deceased"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
