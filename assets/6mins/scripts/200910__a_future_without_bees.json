Here\u2019s Claire Bates from BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World to remind us:"},{"author":"Claire Bates","text":"What is pollination ? All flowering plants need it to reproduce. Pollen is moved from the male part of a flower to the female part of a flower, then fertilisation can happen causing fruit to grow. Some staple crops such as wheat, rice and corn are pollinated by the wind however many plants don\u2019t release their pollen easily and this is where insects, and especially bees, come in. As they collect nectar to eat, pollen sticks to them and they carry it from flower to flower."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Pollination is the process in which pollen is taken from one plant to another so that it can reproduce. This is the important work done by bees and insects."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Only after pollination can the next process occur \u2013 fertilisation - when the pollen carried from another plant fertilises a female ovule to make new seeds."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Fertilisation occurs in all flowering plants, some of which like wheat, potatoes and rice are staple crops - food that is eaten in large amounts as part of a community\u2019s daily diet and provides a large fraction of their energy and nutrient needs."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Fewer bees reduces pollination levels, meaning fewer new seeds are created and fewer crops grown."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But it isn\u2019t just the decline in bee numbers causing a problem. Like us, bees need to rest and this has led some to come up with creative new ways of supplementing bee pollination."},{"author":"Sam","text":"One such innovator is Keren Mimran, co-founder of agro-tech company, Edete. Here she is, explaining how dropping pollen from drones can pollinate crops, giving a helping hand to hard-working bees."},{"author":"Keren Mimran","text":"How come our food security is so much dependent on an insect that we cannot really control? We can bring the bees to the orchard or to a field but we cannot control their behaviour. They do not come out of the hive when it\u2019s raining or when there\u2019s heavy wind, they work only during daytime. There must be a possibility of developing a mechanical solution to the pollination challenge."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Keren Mimran speaking on the BBC World Service programme People Fixing The World . Bees\u2019 behaviour can\u2019t be controlled - when it rains they won\u2019t leave their hive \u2013 the structure where bees live, either built by people or made by the bees themselves."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So Keren\u2019s company has developed drones to drop pollen on her orchard \u2013 an area of land on which fruit trees are grown."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The need for these high-tech solutions reflects the seriousness of the pollination problem for food security -everyone getting enough affordable and nutritious food to meet their daily dietary needs."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I had no idea bees were so important, Neil. Maybe I underestimated how hard they work."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, you mean today\u2019s quiz question.
