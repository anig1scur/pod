It\u2019s interesting that we say \u2018mother tongue\u2019, isn\u2019t it? Like many languages, English has a number of gender-specific terms that don\u2019t refer to gender-specific ideas and concepts. And this complicated relationship between language and gender is what we will be talking about today. But first, this week\u2019s quiz question, which is also on the topic of languages. Which of these languages is the newest? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, I\u2019ve only heard of two of these - Esperanto and Afrikaans \u2013 so I think I\u2019m going to choose the other one, Light Warlpiri, purely as I\u2019ve never heard of it, so I think that must be the one."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, well we\u2019ll find out if your intuition is correct later in the programme. Professor Lera Boroditsky is a cognitive scientist who was a guest on the BBC World Service programme, The Conversation. She was asked about why we use the term \u2018mother tongue\u2019 in English."},{"author":"Professor Lera Boroditsky","text":"Different languages actually do it differently, but definitely there\u2019s a strong association between mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things, and so there\u2019s that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, how does she explain the use of mother tongue, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, she says it\u2019s a form of metaphor . A metaphor is a way of describing something by comparing it to something else. In a metaphor ,though, you don\u2019t say that something is like something else, you say that it \u2018 is\u2019 something else. For example, having good friends is the key to a happy life."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It is indeed. In this metaphor , language is seen as coming from your primary caregiver , the person who looked after you most when you were young, and traditionally this was mothers."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, this is perhaps the point of origin , the starting place,of the metaphorical phrase, mother tongue . Let\u2019s listen again."},{"author":"Professor Lera Boroditsky","text":"Different languages actually do it differently, but definitely there\u2019s a strong association between mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things, and so there\u2019s that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Language is very powerful in society and culture, and when it comes to gendered language, it can cause some issues. Here\u2019s Lera Boroditsky again:"},{"author":"Professor Lera Boroditsky","text":"\u2026 in English of course we have some words that are gendered, like \u2018actor\u2019 and \u2018actress\u2019 or \u2018waiter\u2019 and \u2018waitress\u2019, and very commonly when there are those two gender forms people perceive the masculine form as being a more prestigious job or the more skilled job than the feminine form, so an actor is a fancier job than an actress and a waiter is a fancier job than a waitress, and so they could then come with pay disparities and so on."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, what\u2019s the subconscious difference in attitude towards, for example, an actor and actress?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, she says that people perceive those roles differently. This means that we are aware of, or believe there is a difference in the jobs because of the vocabulary. The male form is perceived to be more prestigious \u2013 more important, more respected, even though it\u2019s exactly the same job."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And this attitude can lead to problems such as disparities in pay. A disparity is a difference, an inequality, and in the world of work it can mean men getting paid more than women for the same job. Here\u2019s Professor Boroditsky again."},{"author":"Professor Lera","text":"Boroditsky \u2026in English of course we have some words that are gendered, like \u2018actor\u2019 and \u2018actress\u2019 or \u2018waiter\u2019 and \u2018waitress\u2019, and very commonly when there are those two gender forms people perceive the masculine form as being a more prestigious job or a more skilled job than the feminine form, so an actor is a fancier job than an actress and a waiter is a fancier job than a waitress, and so they could then come with pay disparities and so on."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, before we take another look at today\u2019s vocabulary, let\u2019s reveal the answer to this week\u2019s quiz. Which of these languages is the newest, is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I thought it had to be Light Walpiri, but just because I had never heard of it before."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, congratulations. Your instincts were good, that is correct. Let\u2019s move on to vocabulary and look at today\u2019s words and phrase again."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A primary caregiver is a person who has most responsibility for looking after someone."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A point of origin is the place or time when something begins."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A metaphor is a way of describing something. We can say that something is something else that has similar qualities."},{"author":"Sam","text":"You\u2019re a star!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Aw, thank you."},{"author":"Sam","text":"No, I meant, you're a star, is an example of a metaphor ."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Oh, OK. Of course, I knew that."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Mmmm, if you say so. To perceive is to think of something in a particular way. We might perceive the value of different jobs based on the vocabulary used to describe them."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Something prestigious is important and respected."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, a disparity is a difference, an inequality and is often used when talking about how men and women aren\u2019t always paid the same for the same job. And that is all from us. We look forward to your company again soon. In the meantime, you can always find us online, on social media and on the BBC Learning English app. Bye for now."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["","Sam","Georgina","Professor Lera
