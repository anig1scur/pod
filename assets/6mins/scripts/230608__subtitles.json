This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you\u2019re deaf or hard of hearing, watching television would be impossible without subtitles - the words of dialogue added at the bottom of the screen explaining what the characters are saying."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Subtitled captions aren\u2019t only for dialogue. In the most dramatic, action-packed scenes of a movie, there might be no-one speaking, but there are plenty of sounds - a scream, a thrilling car chase\u2026 And all these sounds need to be described as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be meeting Karli Witkowska, a subtitler who works on the Stranger Things show, to find out more. And of course, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But first I have a question for you, Neil. Movie subtitles are written ahead of time, but subtitling for live TV has to be done in the moment, as the person is speaking.  This can lead to mistakes - sometimes very funny ones, including a subtitle which appeared in an interview for the BBC Six O\u2019Clock News in 2019. But what did the subtitle say? Was it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, I guess the subtitling mistake involved Spiderman."},{"author":"Beth","text":"I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Of course, it\u2019s not just deaf audiences that subtitles help. The translated subtitles of foreign films are great for learning languages, letting you read a word and hear how its pronounced at the same time. And because subtitles describe everything, from monster squelches to bombs exploding, it\u2019s a great way to learn new adjectives. Here\u2019s subtitler Karli Witkowska explaining to BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth how her choice of adjective creates emotion for the viewer:"},{"author":"Karli Witkowska","text":"Karli Witkowska It depends on the genre and depends on the shows, and so if you have a very upbeat period piece where the music is very jaunty \u2026 you would use the word \u2018jaunty\u2019 to describe the music. It\u2019s creating an idea of what a sound is like and using a very, very descriptive word in order to do so."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Karli bases her descriptions on the film\u2019s genre \u2013 a style of film, music or book with its own particular set of features. The sound effects needed for a thriller like Stranger Things \u2013 creaking stairs and sudden screams - are very different from the sounds used in historical period dramas which are more upbeat \u2013 light-hearted and cheerful."},{"author":"Beth","text":"This influences the adjective Karli chooses to describe a sound. For example, upbeat music might be described as jaunty - full of energy and confidence."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Subtitles started out as an accessibility feature for deaf audiences, and to translate foreign language films into English. But since the growth of online streaming services like Netflix, subtitling has become something of an art."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Karli belongs to a team of subtitlers who try to make their descriptions as close as possible to the sounds they hear. Here she tells BBC Radio 4\u2019s Word of Mouth about a time her team found exactly the right word:"},{"author":"Karli Witkowska","text":"Karli Witkowska \u2026so I loved \u2018 gobsmacked silence\u2019 because you were able to tell that people were almost on the verge of a gasp , or on the verge of a shock, and that was the atmosphere, but there wasn\u2019t actually a sound, so when my colleague came up with that one I definitely wanted to give him a virtual high five."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this scene, the surprised characters were about to gasp \u2013 take in a short, quick breath of air. There was no speech or sound in the scene, but Karli\u2019s team found the perfect adjective to describe the silence - gobsmacked , which is slang for being so surprised you can\u2019t speak."},{"author":"Beth","text":"This was definitely one description that deserved a high five \u2013 lifting up your hand to clap hands with someone else as a greeting or to say \u2018well done\u2019. In fact, the phrase \u2018gobsmacked silence\u2019 was so good it went viral and started being used in all kinds of situations."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe gobsmacked was how the viewers of that TV news programme felt, you know, the mistaken subtitle you asked me about in your question. I guessed the incorrect subtitle was: We can't allow Spiderman to become prime minister."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. In fact the interviewee said, \u201cwe can't allow that man to become prime minister\u201d, speaking about Boris Johnson, but the misheard subtitle appeared as Batman."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let's recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learnt from this programme on subtitles, starting with genre \u2013 a style of film, music or book with its own particular set of characteristics."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Something which is upbeat ischeerful, hopeful and light-hearted."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective jaunty means full of energy and confidence."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If you gasp , you take in a short, quick breath of air in surprise or in pain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You can use the slang expression gobsmacked when someone is so surprised they can\u2019t speak."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, if you give someone a high five , you hold up your hand above your head, clapping hands with somebody else as a greeting, or to say \u2018well done!\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Once again our 6 minutes are up.
