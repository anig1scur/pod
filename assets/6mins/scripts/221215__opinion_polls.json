This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam. Predicting the future is not easy but that\u2019s exactly the job of opinion pollsters \u2013 researchers who ask people questions to discover what they think about certain topics. Often their aim is predicting which political party will win in election by asking members of the public how they intend to vote."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But predicting the future is never one hundred percent accurate, and opinion polls don\u2019t always get it right. In 2016, few pollsters predicted a victory for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And in the 2020 US elections, most polls predicted Trump would lose to Joe Biden by a much larger amount than he actually did. These mistakes, sometimes called misfires -when things do not work in the way intended - have damaged the reputation of opinion pollsters. In this programme we\u2019ll be taking a look into the opinion polling industry and, of course, learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first I have a question for you, Sam, and it\u2019s about another time when the opinion polls got it wrong. Few pollsters predicted that Britain would vote to leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum which, in the end, it did. But what was the final split between those who voted to leave and those who wanted to remain? Was it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think it was b) 52 percent voted to leave and 48 percent to remain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Sam","text":"One of the biggest polling companies was founded by George Gallup. Born in 1901 on a farm in Iowa, Gallup was a student of journalism. He wanted to know people\u2019s opinion on a range of subjects and came up with a simple idea \u2013 why not try asking them? Here\u2019s G Elliot Morris, a data journalist for \u2018The Economist\u2019, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, More or Less\u2026"},{"author":"G Elliot Morris","text":"And he publishes his dissertation on this - how to measure what people want, basically. And he gets hired by a much bigger advertising agency in New York called Young and Rubicam. And they basically give him a blank cheque to do their research, to figure out how to call people, how to talk to them, to figure out if they remember or liked a certain product. Basically to figure out early methodologies in advertising. And then by 1931 or so, he's wondering: well, if it works for toothpaste, why not politics?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"George Gallup tried to figure out what customers wanted to buy. If you figure something out, you finally understand it or find a solution to a problem after thinking about it a lot."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Later he was hired by a New York advertising agency to find out people\u2019s opinion of consumer products like toothpaste and soft drinks. George was given a blank cheque \u2013 an unlimited amount of money and freedom to do his job."},{"author":"Neil","text":"At this time, polling was focused on consumer preferences, not politics. But asking people about their political views is a lot more complicated than asking them about toothpaste. Making accurate election predictions depends on polling a sample group of people who accurately represent the population as a whole. One of the reasons for pollsters failure to predict Trump\u2019s election in 2016 is that they didn\u2019t ask enough white, non-college educated voters."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, polling is a very complex process, one which is never totally reliable according to G Elliot Morris , speaking again here to BBC World Service\u2019s, More or Less\u2026"},{"author":"G Elliot Morris","text":"If people were understanding this process, that\u2019s generating all the polls, then they would understand polls as less precise tools \u2013 tools that definitely can\u2019t offer the laser-like predictive accuracy we\u2019ve come to expect from them, then the difference between polling\u2019s\u2019 expectations and performance wouldn\u2019t be so stark."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Opinion polls can estimate the outcome of an election but they can\u2019t give us laser-like accuracy. If you describe something as laser-like you mean it is very accurate and focused, like a laser."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If people understand how hard it is to predict the future, they might be more realistic about how accurate opinion polls can be. Then, differences between a prediction and the final result wouldn\u2019t be so stark \u2013 obvious and easily visible, or harsh."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Predicting the future is difficult, otherwise everyone would be a lottery winner by now! Maybe it\u2019s not opinion polls that are broken but our desire to know the future that\u2019s the problem. OK, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question about the Brexit referendum."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said the final result was 52 percent for leave and 48 percent for remain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! and another example of an opinion poll misfire \u2013 a situation where something does not work as intended. OK, let\u2019s recap the rest of the vocabulary from this programme about opinion pollsters \u2013 people who conduct polls asking the public their opinion on particular subjects, especially politics."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you figure something out , you finally understand it, or find the solution to a problem after thinking long and hard about it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If someone gives you a blank cheque , you have unlimited money and freedom to complete a task."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When you describe something as laser-like you mean that it\u2019s very accurate and precise."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, the adjective stark has several meanings including obvious, harsh and plain.
