In this programme we'll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course \u2026"},{"author":"Dan","text":"How would you like to be a mermaid?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it's all a myth."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, then you'll find this week's question a bit of a difficult one to answer."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I suppose I will. Go on then."},{"author":"Dan","text":"When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Ok, and by alleged, you mean 'said or believed to be true but not proven'. I don't believe in mermaids, but I think there's a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, we'll find out if you're right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, a mermaid is a creature that's similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth."},{"author":"Dan","text":"They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, 'The Little Mermaid'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"There you go! There's no real evidence."},{"author":"Dan","text":"What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"You're telling me fish tales, Dan"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ok. I'll confess. They aren't real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist-high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it's a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Daniel Craig, merman A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So it's a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or 'found it by accident'. So, it doesn't really count then though, does it Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"A real, real mermaid? That's a different kettle of fish , which is an idiomatic phrase that means 'a completely different matter or issue'. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Hang on now, that rings a bell! That's in Israel, isn't it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks."},{"author":"Dan","text":"There you go then!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means 'a deception or lie \u2013 often done for humour or sometimes cruelty'. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Daniel Craig, merman It's just serene . It's the perfect place for a temporary getaway ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So he likes it because it's serene , which means 'calm and peaceful'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes and he says it's the perfect getaway , which is 'a place you go in order to escape from normal life'."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, I still don't believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And I said I think it was the 2000s"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Thank you"},{"author":"Dan","text":"You're right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let's take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged . If something is alleged it is 'said or believed be true but not proven to be true'. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there's no proof. And our next one was stumbled across . So, if you stumble across something you 'encounter or find it by accident'. It's a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Spooky."},{"author":"Dan","text":"The next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means 'a completely different matter or issue'. You could also use the phrase 'a horse of a different colour'."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Next up, we had hoax . And a hoax is 'a deception or lie \u2013 which is often done for humour or cruelty'. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene . Serene means 'calm and peaceful'. The noun is serenity. What's your idea of serene, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning 'a place you go in order to escape from normal life', such as a holiday. So, where's your favourite getaway, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"My favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
