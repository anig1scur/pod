Or fairies and elves?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Have you been reading fantasy books, Neil? Lord of the Rings?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I have been reading a book, Georgina, but not Lord of the Rings.

I\u2019ve got it \u2013 a mermaid!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right!

The Selkies can take human form and marry men but every now and then they return to their watery kingdom under the sea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Cristina Bacchilega is co-editor of The Penguin Book of Mermaids.
