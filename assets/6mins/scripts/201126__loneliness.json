This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s great that you\u2019re here to keep me company \u2013 to spend time with me so I don\u2019t get lonely \u2013 because loneliness is the subject of this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s good to be here, Neil. I think many of us have experienced loneliness at some point. Maybe you\u2019ve felt lonely because all your friends have gone out for dinner without you, or maybe you\u2019ve felt lonely just because you don\u2019t fit in somewhere."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, that\u2019s when we sometimes use the expression \u2018to feel lonely in a crowd\u2019. Well, we\u2019ll be exploring if this is a new idea or something humans have always experienced, and along the way we\u2019ll be teaching you some new vocabulary."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But now I\u2019m here to keep you company, how about a question for me?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course! Well, one possibly lonely man is Mauro Morandi. He\u2019s lived alone on Budelli Island in Italy for many years, but how many years exactly? Is it: a) 6 years, b) 31 years, or c) 44 years?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Umm 44 years would be tough, as would 31, so I\u2019ll go for 6 years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Rob, we\u2019ll find out later if that\u2019s right. Now, I\u2019m sure we all want to be alone from time to time, to escape the demands of our colleagues or the pressures of real life, but would we really want to be totally alone?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I certainly wouldn\u2019t. And research has found that prolonged social isolation is bad for us, particularly mentally."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s an interesting topic, and one that the BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Aloud has been exploring. Its guest, Fay Bound Alberti, Reader in History at the University of York, explained how loneliness is a relatively new emotional state ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A state is a condition at a particular time. Let\u2019s hear what she had to say about references to loneliness in literature."},{"author":"Fay Bound Alberti","text":"Well novels are fascinating, because there\u2019s a difference between novels in the 18th Century, when they first came into being, and novels in the 19th Century - in the 18th Century something like Robinson Crusoe, there\u2019s not a single reference to loneliness. By the 19th Century novels are full of lonely people and that reflects those kinds of social changes ."},{"author":"Interviewer","text":"Give me some examples. What may count as examples?"},{"author":"Fay Bound Alberti","text":"Well, I suppose I\u2019m thinking about if you compare something like Wuthering Heights where you have this desperate desire on the part of the heroine to find love which is bundled up to in this sense of the self not being complete without another, or Tess of the d\u2019Ubervilles. And so Victorian fiction in particular tends to be full of woman who are in search of the significant other and needing to find happiness and an absence of loneliness in the domestic."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s interesting that Fay mentions the story of Robinson Crusoe \u2013 about a man living on a desert island \u2013 does not mention the word loneliness. But because of a shift in how people behaved and thought in the 19th century \u2013 called social change \u2013 loneliness became an emotion that was written about in stories."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, but loneliness tended to be something affecting women. They were searching for happiness by finding a \u2018 significant other\u2019 \u2013 a partner, usually a man, who they wanted to marry. How things have changed!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, now Fay also went on to talk about how some female authors, like Virginia Woolf, looked for solitude \u2013 that\u2019s being alone \u2013 because that helped them be creative."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even today, being alone gives us headspace and time to think, as long as it doesn\u2019t last forever. Anyway, as we mentioned, we\u2019ve probably all been lonely at some point, and Fay Bound Alberti told the Thinking Aloud programme that loneliness can take many forms."},{"author":"Fay Bound Alberti","text":"Absolutely, I think that loneliness is something that affects all people but at different times in their lives. I would describe in terms of pinch points \u2013 there are times when we change [when we become] when we get married, we become mothers, we get divorced, anything that changes our life might put us under temporary loneliness. When it\u2019s a problem is when it becomes chronic ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It seems that there are certain times in our lives when we might feel lonely \u2013 when we break up with a partner or have a baby and feel isolated, for example. These are moments that Fay describes as pinch points \u2013 times in your life where there are difficulties and things slow down or change."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We could say loneliness at these times is understandable, normal and temporary. When it becomes a bigger issue, it\u2019s what Fay describes as chronic \u2013 so, long lasting."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And loneliness isn\u2019t always obvious to other people, so it\u2019s good to check in with friends and family to see how they\u2019re feeling and to ask if they\u2019re OK. Of course, it would be difficult to check in on Mauro Morandi, who\u2019s been living on Budelli Island in Italy for many years, but how many years exactly?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ahh well I thought 6 years. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m afraid not. It\u2019s actually been 31 years. He told National Geographic magazine \u201cI\u2019m sort of in prison here\u2026 but it\u2019s a prison that I chose for myself.\u201d So I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s got used to his own company! I certainly couldn\u2019t live alone for that long \u2013 I\u2019d been too lonely, I need company Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yeah, me too Neil! And loneliness is what we\u2019ve been discussing in this programme. Here\u2019s a recap of some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned. Firstly, to keep someone company is to spend time with someone so they don\u2019t get lonely."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Social change is a shift in how people behave and think."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A significant other is an informal way of describing a partner."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Solitude describes being alone."},{"author":"Rob","text":"When talking about life, pinch points are times where there are difficulties and things slow down or change. And chronic describes a health condition that is long lasting."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s all we have time for in this programme, but remember you can find more useful vocabulary, trending topics and help with your language learning here at BBC Learning English. We also have an app that you can download for free from the app stores and of course we are all over social media.
