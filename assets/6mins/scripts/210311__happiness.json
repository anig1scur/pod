Well, did you know that every year the UN publishes its Global Happiness Survey revealing the happiest countries in the world? It\u2019s based on factors like income, life expectancy and health.

We\u2019ll find out the answer later, but you\u2019re certainly right to say that Denmark is considered one of the happiest countries in the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Malene Rydahl, author of the bestselling book, Happy as a Dane, believes that aspects of Danish culture can help us improve our chances of happiness."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here she is explaining what happiness means for her to BBC World Service programme, The Conversation. See if you can hear what she thinks:"},{"author":"Malene Rydahl","text":"Well, I think we should be seeking alignment and I think we should practise gratitude and I think that we should be more conscious about how we relate to things that happen to us and how much we compare ourselves to others\u2026 I do think that what we need to focus on is the quality of our relationships."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Did you hear Malene use the word alignment ? She thinks there should be harmony between my true sense of who I am, what I think and how I relate to others. We should be in alignment \u2013 or in the correct relation, to those things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Malene also thinks happiness comes from gratitude \u2013 feeling grateful and expressing thanks to other people."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"She recommends finding three things, no matter how small, to be grateful for every day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like\u2026 getting a good night\u2019s sleep, drinking a hot coffee\u2026 and having this chat with you, Georgina."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Thanks, Neil, that\u2019s put a smile on my face! It may sound strange but doing this every day can really boost your happiness levels."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Malene also warns against seeking happiness in external things, as you can hear in this chat with BBC World Service\u2019s, The Conversation:"},{"author":"Malene Rydahl","text":"If you seek happiness and you mistake it for pleasure, you will be running around like a little hamster in a wheel because it\u2019s never enough and because you will be very quickly the victim of the hedonic treadmill \u2026 and the hedonic treadmill is\u2026 you know, you want something, you think if you\u2019re more beautiful, if you get more power, if you get more money and fame and then you\u2019ll finally be happy\u2026 and then you get it and you get a small satisfaction ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to Malene, chasing external pleasures like money and fame will leave you feeling like a hamster on a wheel \u2013 like someone who\u2019s always busy but never accomplishes anything useful or finishes what they start."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"She also says it\u2019s easy to become a victim of the hedonic treadmill . This is the idea that humans adapt to whatever level of happiness they achieve. As we make more money, meet the perfect boyfriend or whatever we desire, our expectations also increase, so we never find the happiness we hoped we would!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Money can\u2019t buy happiness\u2019, as my grandma used to say."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Right. In fact, it\u2019s probably the quality of our relationships, not external objects, that gives satisfaction \u2013 the pleasure we feel when we achieve something we wanted to."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Lots of useful tips there, Georgina, for feeling as happy as a Dane."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A Dane, you say, Neil? So I got the correct answer?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In my quiz question I asked Georgina which Nordic country was rated happiest in the UN\u2019s 2020 global survey."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I guessed, b) Denmark."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But in fact, Georgina, it was\u2026 c) Finland. I guess their bacon sandwiches are even better!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary and start seeing the glass half full \u2013 looking at things in a positive way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Happiness might be all about alignment \u2013 being in the correct relation to things."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Or gratitude \u2013 being grateful and giving thanks."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Feeling like a hamster on a wheel means you\u2019re always busy doing things but without getting satisfaction - the pleasant feeling of achieving something you really wanted to."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Finally, the reason happiness often escapes us may involve the hedonic treadmill - the human tendency to return to the same level of happiness after something very good or very bad has happened."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme. We hope it\u2019s lifted your spirits and given you some useful vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Remember to join us again soon for more interesting topics here at 6 Minute English.
