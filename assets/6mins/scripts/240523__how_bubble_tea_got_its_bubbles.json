This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth. Are you a tea or coffee drinker, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I usually drink a cup of coffee in the morning. How about you, Beth?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Oh, I\u2019m definitely a tea drinker. There\u2019s nothing like a good cuppa to start the day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, a cuppa \u2013 it\u2019s a word in British English meaning a cup of tea, right? But there are many different types of tea. Which tea do you like?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Well, I usually drink English Breakfast tea in the morning, then a matcha tea at lunch, and maybe a calming herbal tea before bed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow! It sounds like you\u2019re a real tea addict, Beth, so you\u2019ll love this programme because we\u2019re discussing an exciting drink called \u2018bubble tea\u2019. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Great. But first, I have a question for you, Neil. Today, British supermarkets sell almost twice as much coffee as tea, and consumer surveys have found that a majority of Brits prefer drinking coffee. So, what proportion of Brits do you think still regularly drink tea? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, let me think about that. I'm going to say b) 49%."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. People have been drinking tea for centuries, but that doesn\u2019t mean tea drinking hasn\u2019t changed over the years. Here in Britain, new trends such as iced tea and green matcha tea have become as popular as the traditional English cuppa which, as everyone knows, is black tea with a splash of milk."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One of the latest tea trends is pearl milk tea, also called bubble tea, but if you\u2019ve never heard of it, don\u2019t worry - here\u2019s presenter, Ben Henderson, explaining more for BBCWorld Service programme, Witness History:"},{"author":"Ben Henderson","text":"For those who don't know, pearl milk tea or bubble tea, is tea usually mixed with milk, crushed ice and filled with its signature chewy tapioca balls. But customers can then add whatever flavours they want. It's innovative and exciting."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Pearl milk tea, or bubble tea as it\u2019s often called, was invented in 1987 by Taiwanese tea shop owner, Liu Han-Chieh. The \u2018bubbles\u2019 in a glass of bubble tea are made from balls of a chewy starch called tapioca. Food which is chewy needs to be chewed a lot before it becomes soft enough to swallow."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s these tapioca balls which give bubble tea its name. You might say they\u2019re bubble tea\u2019s signature ingredient \u2013 they\u2019re a special feature for which something is particularly known. For example, paella is the signature dish of Spain."},{"author":"Beth","text":"What\u2019s more, because tapioca doesn\u2019t have a strong taste, different flavours can be added, making bubble tea an innovative, meaning new and original, drink. Liu Han-Chieh\u2019s invention was inspired by a trip to Japan where he saw people enjoying iced milk tea on a hot summer day. When he added tapioca balls, which he found in a local market on his return to Taiwan, the bubbly new beverage was born."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But it was only when famous international celebrities including basketball player, Michael Jordan, and movie star, Jackie Chan, started visiting his tea shop, that Liu Han-Chieh\u2019s bubble tea began a revolution in the tea-drinking world. Here is Liu Han-Chieh telling more to BBC World Service programme, Witness History:"},{"author":"Liu Han-Chieh","text":"Pearl milk tea got huge media coverage and it spread like wildfire. But I always say, we have many other products, and the reason pearl milk tea became so popular was pure luck. It was a miracle ."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Thanks to its celebrity fans, Liu Han-Chieh\u2019s bubble tea became an international bestseller, and news of his exciting new drink spread like wildfire , an idiom meaning it became quickly known by many people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As more and more people tried it and fell in love with its smooth chewy taste, bubble tea spread to neighbouring countries like South Korea and China, and then to the rest of the world. For Liu Han-Chieh it was a miracle , a very lucky event that is surprising and unexpected."},{"author":"Beth","text":"It\u2019s great to hear about something that gives a modern twist to a drink that\u2019s part of a country\u2019s traditional culture\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s what we need here in Britain too."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, your question was about the fact that nowadays more people in Britain prefer coffee than tea. I think it\u2018s time you revealed the answer."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Right. I asked you what percent of Brits still regularly prefer drinking tea over coffee and you said 49 percent, which was\u2026 the wrong answer I\u2019m afraid, Neil. In fact, around 59 percent of Brits still regularly drink tea. Maybe it\u2019s time for a bubble tea revolution over here! OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with cuppa , an informal word in British English for a cup of tea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The word signature describes a special feature for which something is particularly known."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If food is chewy it needs to be chewed a lot before it\u2019s soft enough to swallow."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective innovative means new and original."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If something spreads like wildfire , itbecomes quickly known by more and more people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, a miracle is a very lucky event that is surprising and unexpected. Once again our six minutes are up but remember to join us again next time for more topical discussion and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Ben Henderson","Liu
