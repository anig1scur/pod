This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Georgie."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth. Leaving home, getting married, and a parent dying are three of the most important experiences in many people\u2019s lives. But perhaps the most defining moment in some women\u2019s\u2019 lives is \u2018the miracle of birth\u2019, in other words, having a baby."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Throughout pregnancy a lot of care and attention is given to expecting mums. But as soon as the baby is born, this attention moves to the new-born baby, making sure they are healthy, warm and safe."},{"author":"Beth","text":"We talk a lot about baby nutrition, but what the mother eats can be just as important, especially the first meal after the intense effort of giving birth, whether it\u2019s chicken soup, a glass of champagne, or a good old cuppa tea. In this programme, we\u2019re talking about what women eat and drink in the first few weeks after having a baby. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"But first I have a question for you, Beth. A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, but when does an unborn baby\u2019s stomach start to grow in the mother\u2019s womb? Is it:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I\u2019ll say the baby's tummy starts to grow at about five weeks."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"OK, Beth, we\u2019ll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme. Giving birth is not called \u2018labour\u2019 for nothing \u2013 it\u2019s hard work, leaving the new mum physically and emotionally exhausted, and in need of food that\u2019s nourishing, for both herself and her baby. Here\u2019s Allison Oman Lawi, deputy director of nutrition to the United Nations World Food Programme, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Allison Oman Lawi","text":"A woman who is breastfeeding and during that postpartum time, the first six months, she could need up to 650 additional calories a day which actually is quite a bit more than she even needed in addition during pregnancy."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Alison says that women need to eat even more calories postpartum, meaning after childbirth, than they do during pregnancy. That\u2019s especially true for mothers who are breastfeeding, feeding their baby directly with milk from her breasts."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"How new mums get those extra calories changes from place to place, and different cultures have developed their own traditions about what foods are best. For Chinese-American mum, Heng Ou, roast pig trotters were one of the best things to eat after childbirth because they contain a lot of collagen which helps produce breast milk."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And when Ruma, who\u2019s Punjabi family originally comes from India, gave birth to a baby boy, her mother cooked panjeeri, a kind of spicy nut mix with cashews, almonds and melon seeds to promote breast milk and help the healing process. Listen now as Ruma explains how important her mother\u2019s help was, to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Ruma","text":"So, the first 10 days were amazing. My mum came to stay and gosh! it was so important because I had a C-section so I was on very strong painkillers, I was in a daze anyway, and to be honest because she was here I was fed, you know, so she would look after me while I would look after baby. And my husband was very hands-on as well, so that first ten days whilst it was really hard, I didn't fall apart which I might have done if I'd been by myself."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"When Ruma talks about her mother\u2019s help, she uses the word, gosh!, an exclamation used to show a feeling of wonder or surprise. Ruma also says she was in a daze because of medicine she was taking for pain. If someone is in a daze , they feel confused and cannot think clearly, maybe because of a shock or surprise."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Luckily, Ruma had help from her mum, and also her husband who was very hands-on, meaning that he was closely involved in organizing things and making decisions, and didn\u2019t leave it up to someone else."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Along with her mother\u2019s healthy home cooking, the help Ruma got from her family meant she didn\u2019t fall apart , a phrase which means become so emotionally disturbed that you\u2019re unable to think or act calmly, or to deal with the situation you\u2019re in."},{"author":"Beth","text":"New mums have to be expert jugglers, balancing a new baby and recovering from childbirth, with getting too little sleep. No wonder they need hot healthy food to eat! Right, isn\u2019t it time you revealed the answer to your question, Georgie?"},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Sure. I asked you when an unborn baby\u2019s stomach starts to grow. You guessed it was at five weeks, which was\u2026 the correct answer, Beth! At about 5 weeks, the cells forming a baby\u2019s stomach, lungs, bone and brain all start to divide and grow. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with postpartum meaning following childbirth."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Breastfeeding is feeding a baby directly with milk from the mother\u2019s breasts."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"The exclamation gosh! is used to express a feeling of surprise or wonder."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If you\u2019re in a daze , you feel confused and unable to think clearly, often because of a shock or surprise."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"If someone is hands-on , they\u2019re closely involved in organizing things and making decisions, rather than just talking about it or getting someone else to do it."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, the phrasal verb fall apart means to become seriously emotionally disturbed so that you are unable to think calmly or to deal with the difficult situation you are in.
