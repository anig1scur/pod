This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018 Head over heels\u2019, \u2018butterflies in the tummy\u2019, \u2018the apple of my eye\u2019 \u2013 in English there are many idioms to describe what it feels like to fall in love."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Aww, I didn\u2019t know you were such a romantic, Neil! But do you know what\u2019s actually happening in our brains when we fall in love? Because I\u2019m sorry to say this, Neil, but it\u2019s more about brain chemistry than romance \u2013 specifically hormones, chemical messengers which the body releases into the blood to control our growth, mood, and yes \u2013 falling in love."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks for ruining my romantic ideas, Beth! And since my dreams are now shattered, why don\u2019t we spend the rest of this programme finding out exactly what is going on inside our bodies and brains when we fall in love. And, of course, learn some useful new vocabulary too."},{"author":"Beth","text":"There\u2019s no doubt that being in love has the health benefit of reducing stress, even lengthening your life, but the hormones which the brain releases have an immediate effect as well. So, chemically speaking, what happens when lovers look into each others\u2019 eyes? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, is it\u2026 all three? No? OK then, I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s b) their heartbeats harmonise."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s correct at the end of the programme. According to Helen E Fisher, self-help author and anthropologist at Rutgers University, there are three aspects of romantic love. Here\u2019s BBC Ideas to explain more:"},{"author":"Helen E Fisher","text":"Often lust comes first, but not always. For some people who are asexual, it may not happen at all. But for those who do experience lust, it\u2019s driven by the hormones oestrogen and testosterone. It may feel purely carnal, but in fact it's about the urge to mate and pass on your DNA via offspring. Without lust, it's fair to say our species would not survive."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Helen Fisher thinks the first aspect of love is purely physical \u2013 lust, the strong feeling of sexual desire for someone. Lust is driven by the hormones oestrogen in women, and testosterone in men. A few people are asexual, meaning they don\u2019t feel sexual attraction for anyone of any gender."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Lust is hardwired into us through our DNA and it drives us to have children. Helen thinks it's fair to say that without lust, our species would not survive. Here, she uses the phrase it\u2019s fair to say to introduce an idea she believes to be true and reasonable."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course, love is not just physical. Here\u2019s BBC Ideas again to introduce Helen Fisher\u2019s second aspect of love, attraction:"},{"author":"Helen E Fisher","text":"The second aspect of romantic love is attraction, influenced by a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This is a feel-good substance released in our brain that is involved in driving us towards reward. Do something, get a dopamine hit, feel good. Eventually dopamine will push us toward repeating that behaviour. This is why intense attraction feels like an addiction to another human being. Some people get stuck in that loop , always chasing the dopamine-soaked excitement of a new relationship."},{"author":"Beth","text":"This time, the hormone responsible is dopamine, a neurotransmitter that rewards our attraction to someone with pleasurable feelings. That\u2019s why dopamine is called a feel-good substance. The adjective feel-good can be used to describe anything causing happy and optimistic feelings about life, things like feel-good films or feel-good music."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here, though, there\u2019s a downside. The dopamine \u2018hit\u2019 of sexual attraction feels so good, we crave it more and more. Some people are always chasing the next relationship to get a new \u2018hit\u2019 of pleasure, and soon become stuck in a loop \u2013 an idiom meaning they\u2019re unable to break the habit of repeating the same patterns of behaviour over and over again."},{"author":"Beth","text":"It\u2019s fascinating to see the power which hormones have over us, but if you\u2019re an old-fashioned romantic like Neil, don\u2019t despair. And speaking as a romantic, how about the answer to my question\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, you asked me about the effect on the body when two lovers look deep into each others\u2019 eyes. I guessed it was that their heartbeats harmonise."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! In experiments, looking into the eyes produced hormones causing couple\u2019s hearts to beat in time. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with the idiom head over heels \u2013 to be completely in love with someone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Lust is a very strong feeling of sexual desire."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Someone who is asexual does not feel sexual attraction towards anyone of any gender."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The phrase, it\u2019s fair to say, is used to introduce a statement you believe to be true and reasonable."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The adjective feel-good describes something which makes people feel happy and optimistic."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, the idiom stuck in a loop describes someone unable to break the habit of repeating the same negative patterns of behaviour over and over again. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more topical discussion and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Helen E
