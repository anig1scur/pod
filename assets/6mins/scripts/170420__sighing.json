I\u2019m Catherine."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Now \u2013 was that a real sigh \u2013 or just one to demonstrate the meaning?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We\u2019ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yes, very interesting. And it\u2019s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Indeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today\u2019s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I\u2019m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour"},{"author":"Dan","text":"OK. Let\u2019s find out if you\u2019re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Let\u2019s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"INSERT Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University It\u2019s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of resetting mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don\u2019t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So sighing keeps us alive."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Dr Barker called it a survival mechanism . To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A mechanism , here, means a system of behaviour."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK, that\u2019s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, scientists from UCLA, that\u2019s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Thankfully, we don\u2019t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Boo!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Argh!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"There \u2013 you jumped! And that was a fabulous reflex , Dan! It\u2019s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I meant\u2026 argh\u2026 like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"You\u2019re welcome. Dan Do you sigh a lot?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, I sigh when I\u2019m tired, and I sigh when I\u2019m relieved. I breathe a sigh of relief ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"To breathe a sigh of relief \u2013 that\u2019s a great expression. It means what you think it means \u2013 to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened \u2013 but it\u2019s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That\u2019s right. Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I\u2019d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I tend to sigh to show frustration . And sometimes resignation ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Now, frustration is what we feel when things aren\u2019t going well, when things are annoying us and they don\u2019t work. When things are frustrating ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And resignation is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can\u2019t change. We feel resigned to something."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about\u2026 mice?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster \u2013 so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Let\u2019s review today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We had the phrase survival mechanism . Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"We often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Next, we had reset . You can reset a computer, or a machine \u2013 to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And you can reset a password \u2013 this is a little bit different. It means to set \u2013 or choose - a new password."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We also had the word reflex . This is a physical action or reaction that you can\u2019t control. For example\u2026 Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yes?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"There, you closed your eyes. Another reflex ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And we had to breathe a sigh to relief . Which means to feel better after something bad doesn\u2019t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness."},{"author":"Dan","text":"But we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: frustration and resignation ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Frustration is the state of being frustrated . We can say something is frustrating . It\u2019s frustrating when the boss doesn\u2019t listen to me."},{"author":"Dan","text":"But let\u2019s say you move beyond feeling frustrated and start feeling resigned ."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yeah, and that would be when I finally accept the boss will never listen to me. And that\u2019s when I\u2019ll resign !"},{"author":"Dan","text":"To resign also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that\u2019s just another vocabulary example?!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Of course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Which is perfectly average. And that's it for today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And we are on social media too.
