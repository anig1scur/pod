This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In every language, there\u2019s one word which has special power over us: our name. Our senses, feelings and whole identity are closely linked to our name. Yet strangely, our name isn\u2019t usually something we choose \u2013 it\u2019s given to us by our parents."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But what if the name you were given at birth doesn\u2019t fit? Maybe you simply don\u2019t like it, or maybe there are bigger reasons for wanting to change your name, reasons connected with historical injustices , or unfair events in the past. In this programme, we\u2019ll be meeting two people whose family history has caused them to consider changing their name. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sounds good, Beth, but first I have a question for you. My name \u2013 Neil \u2013 is a British name and was given to me at birth. But names change a lot between cultures and religions. Many Muslim boys are named Mohammed, Indian boys are often called Ram or Krishna, and in Mexico, some boys are named Jesus. So according to a recent global survey, what is currently the world\u2019s most popular boys\u2019 name? Is it:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Hmm, I guess it\u2019s Mohammed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. In Britain, a person\u2019s first name is also called their Christian name , and in Christianity, many names have a religious meaning. The name John, for example, means \u2018God is good\u2019. Anderson Jeremiah is the Bishop of Edmonton. He was born in South India, but he doesn\u2019t have a traditional Indian sounding name. Here, Bishop Jeremiah explains the roots of his name to BBC World Service programme, Heart and Soul:"},{"author":"Bishop Anderson Jeremiah","text":"It was the name of one John Anderson. He was the first educational missionary who came and worked and set up several schools in South India, who had very noble ambitions, but also as with any missionaries, he was a big collaborator of the colonial establishment at that point in time, so he has a very a strong baggage that goes with it. So, Anderson is my Christian name, and Jeremiah is my dad's name."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bishop Anderson Jeremiah\u2019s name comes from another man, John Anderson, a Christian missionary during the British empire. The history of the British empire in India is controversial with many views on all sides. Bishop Jeremiah thinks that some of the empire\u2019s missionaries were noble , meaning admirable or morally good."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But nevertheless, John Anderson was part of a violent and exploitative empire. Bishop Jeremiah uses the word baggage to describe the beliefs, especially outdated or unhelpful beliefs, which influence how people think. Emotional baggage tends to influence the feelings of one individual, while historical baggage can affect whole societies."},{"author":"Beth","text":"In India, names serve an important purpose: to signify social status. Low-status Indians, including Bishop Anderson\u2019s grandparents, escaped social discrimination by converting to Christianity and taking another, Christian, name. But elsewhere in the British Empire, names were connected with something completely unchristian: slavery."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Black British writer, Professor Robert Beckford, is an activist theologian at the University of Winchester. His surname \u2013 Beckford - is a slave name, passed down from his enslaved African ancestors in"},{"author":"Professor Robert Beckford","text":"My son is named Micah, Micah Beckford, after one of the prophets, so I do like the idea of people in the Biblical tradition who speak truth to power , who ruffle people's feathers , who challenge the injustice. I haven't thought of giving myself a biblical name. I could never find a name that really resonated with me."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The phrase to speak truth to power describes times when people non-violently resist an oppressive force, such as a government or corporation, by telling the truth. And if you ruffle someone\u2019s feathers , you upset or annoy them."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Maybe it\u2019s not so much your name, as what you do with it that counts. Anyway, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you which boys\u2019 name is currently the world\u2019s most popular, and you guessed Mohammed, which was\u2026 the correct answer! Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with injustice , a situation lacking fairness or justice."},{"author":"Beth","text":"In British English, your Christian name is your first name, the name you were given at birth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective noble means admirable or morally good."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Baggage refers to beliefs and feelings, especially outdated or unhelpful ones, which influence how someone thinks."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The idiom speak truth to power describes when people non-violently resist an oppressive force, such as a government or corporation, by telling the truth."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, to ruffle someone\u2019s feathers means to upset or annoy them.
