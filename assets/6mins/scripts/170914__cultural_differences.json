In this programme we bring you an expressive topic and six items of vocabulary. I\u2019m Neil\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"And I\u2019m Tim. So, we had an argument just before we started the show\u2026 Neil We did, Tim. But no hard feelings?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"None. No hard feelings is something you say to somebody you have argued with to say you\u2019d still like to be friends. We often fall out over silly things\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026 Like who\u2019s going to introduce the show\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u2026 Or who\u2019s going to choose the quiz question."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But we understand each other. That\u2019s the important thing, isn't it? To fall out with somebody by the way, is another way of saying to argue or disagree with them. Do you know that you wave your arms around a lot when you\u2019re arguing, Tim?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"No, I didn\u2019t know I did that."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That isn\u2019t very British."},{"author":"Tim","text":"I know. Using gestures \u2013 or movements you make with your hands or your head to express what you are thinking of feeling \u2013 is common in some countries but not in others. Then there are some movements \u2013 like shaking your head \u2013 which mostly means \u2018no\u2019 but in some countries can mean the opposite."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right. In which country does shaking your head mean \u2018yes\u2019, Tim? Is it\u2026 a) Greece, b) Japan or c) Bulgaria?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"No idea \u2013 I\u2019ll guess Greece. I do know that in India people shake their heads to mean lots of different things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There are plenty of gestures you need to be careful with when you\u2019re meeting and greeting people from a culture that\u2019s different to your own \u2013 to avoid offending people \u2013 or making an awkward faux pas\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"If you make a faux pas it means you say or do something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, our every day use of the thumbs-up signal might offend people from the Middle East."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And to offend means to make somebody angry or upset."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Let\u2019s hear now from Business Professor Erin Meyer talking about how easy it is to misunderstand why people behave the way they do in everyday situations when we don\u2019t belong to the same culture."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Erin Meyer, Business Professor in Dubai A while ago I was in Dubai and one of my students, my Emirati students, was driving me home after a session and the car stopped at a light and she rolled down the window, and she started shouting at someone outside of the window. This guy was crossing the street with a big box of cloth. And he started shouting back, and she opened up the door, and they started gesticulating and shouting at one another. And I thought, wow, they\u2019re having a huge fight, I thought maybe he was going to hit her. And she got back in the car, and I said, well, what were you fighting about? And she said, \u2018Oh no, no, we weren\u2019t fighting, he was giving me directions to your hotel.\u2019 And I thought that was a great example of how someone from another culture may misperceive or misunderstand something as a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Gesticulating \u2013 what does that mean?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"It means what I was doing earlier! \u2013 Waving your arms around to express what you\u2019re feeling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Erin Meyer was worried because her student and the man on the street were shouting and gesticulating at each other. She thought they were having a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive."},{"author":"Tim","text":"And expressive means showing what you think or feel."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were nodding in agreement, there, Tim. Which reminds me of our quiz question. In which country does shaking your head mean \u2018yes\u2019? Is it\u2026 a) Greece, b) Japan or c) Bulgaria?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"I said Greece\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. The right answer is Bulgaria. In some Southeastern European areas such as Bulgaria and southern Albania, shaking your head is used to indicate \"yes\". In those regions, nodding in fact means \"no\" as well."},{"author":"Tim","text":"I hope I remember that the next time I meet somebody from Southeastern Europe. OK, shall we look back at the words we learned today?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018No hard feelings\u2019 is something you say to somebody you have argued with or beaten in a game or contest to say you\u2019d still like to be friends."},{"author":"Tim","text":"For example, \u201cI always get the quiz questions right \u2013 unlike you Neil. But no hard feelings, OK?\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s not a very realistic example, Tim\u2026 But I\u2019ll let it go. Number two \u2013 \u2018to fall out with somebody\u2019 means to argue or disagree with them."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cI fell out with my best friend at school. We didn\u2019t talk to each other for a whole week!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That must\u2019ve been a serious disagreement, Tim! What were you arguing about? Tim I can\u2019t remember. It was a long time ago. Number three \u2013 a \u2018gesture\u2019 is a movement you make with your hands or head to express what you are thinking or feeling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cShe opened her arms wide in a gesture of welcome.\u201d"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Or the verb \u2013 \u201cI gestured to Neil that we only had one minute left to finish the show!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Is that true, Tim? You\u2019re nodding your head \u2013 but we should also quickly mention \u2018gesticulate\u2019 which means to make gestures with your hands or arms!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"A \u2018faux pas\u2019 is saying or doing something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, \u201cI committed a serious faux pas at a party last night \u2013 that I\u2019m too embarrassed to tell you about!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, Tim. I hope you didn\u2019t offend too many people \u2013 \u2018offend\u2019 is our next word \u2013 and it means to make somebody angry or upset."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Well, you\u2019ve given us a good example already, Neil, so let\u2019s move on to the final word \u2013 \u2018expressive\u2019 \u2013 which means showing what you think or feel."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cTim has a very expressive face.\u201d"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Thanks! Another quick example \u2013 \u201cI waved my hand expressively to signal to Neil that it was time to finish the show.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Taking my cue from Tim, that\u2019s all for today.
