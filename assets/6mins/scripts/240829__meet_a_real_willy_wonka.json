This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In Britain, millions of kids grow up reading the books of Roald Dahl. Before his death in 1990, Roald Dahl wrote over thirty children\u2019s books, including bestsellers like Matilda and The BFG. But one book in particular is many people\u2019s favourite - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Ah yes, I remember the story of Charlie Bucket \u2013 the poor kid whose luck turns around when he wins a Golden Ticket to the local chocolate factory. The factory is run by the mysterious Willy Wonka who invents all kinds of sweets and chocolates for the children to try \u2013 everything from strawberry-coated fudge to marshmallow pillows. Neil, I really wanted to visit that chocolate factory."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If that story sounds familiar then maybe, as a kid, you also dreamed of tasting chocolate for a living. But in this programme we\u2019ll be meeting a real life Willy Wonka, someone whose job involves exactly that \u2013 inventing and tasting chocolate bars! And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Helle Anttila has the kind of job most people can only dream of. Helle is head of research and development at Fazer, a confectionary company in Finland which has been making and selling chocolate for over 130 years. Helle is responsible for buying the cocoa beans used to make chocolate, and coming up with ideas for new chocolate products to sell. So, my question for you, Neil, is this: what is Britain\u2019s best-selling chocolate bar? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm, well, I\u2019m going to guess that it\u2019s KitKat."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme. With over 6,000 employees, Fazer is Finland\u2019s largest chocolate maker. Just like Willy Wonka, Helle and her team think up new and exciting chocolate products. Here Helle explains more to Ruth Alexander for BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"Part of your job is to travel around the world and eat chocolate?"},{"author":"Helle Anttila","text":"That would be a dream ! But of course you get the different information from different sources around the world. So I think there is a brilliant amount of ideas\u2026 then it is just that OK, when is the right time to actually develop and launch certain type of products, when there is a consumer demand ?"},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"How does it feel when you've developed a new product, a new taste, and it's on the shelves and people are going for it ?"},{"author":"Helle Anttila","text":"It feels great! You really feel proud of my team who is creating the products and creating the taste experience. It\u2019s really a great feeling."},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"Can you tell us about any flops where you just feel like we, chocolate eaters, just weren't ready for it?"},{"author":"Helle Anttila","text":"I think those flops are as important as the products which are gaining great sales, because you always learn."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Helle describes her chocolate-maker job as a dream , something that you want to happen very much, but is not very likely to. But in Helle\u2019s case, her dream came true."},{"author":"Beth","text":"After they invent a new chocolate bar, Helle\u2019s team carefully choose the best time to launch it \u2013 to introduce the new product to the public. Usually this only happens when there is enough consumer demand \u2013 a measurement of how much customers want to buy something based on factors like its price and availability."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If consumer demand is strong, Fazer starts to advertise and promote their new chocolate bar before it hits the shelves \u2013 an idiom meaning that it becomes available for people to buy in the shops. Then it\u2019s just a question of waiting to see if people go for , or choose, the new product."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Some of Helle\u2019s biggest successes have been her Blueberry Truffle and the heart-shaped Geisha bar she invented. But sometimes the new chocolate bar she thinks up is a flop , completely unsuccessful or a failure."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Flop or not, Helle thinks she has one of the best jobs in the world, even if she doesn\u2019t get to eat as much of her chocolate inventions as Willy Wonka. Anyway, speaking of best-selling chocolate, isn\u2019t it time to reveal the answer to your question, Beth?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Right. I asked you about Britain\u2019s best-selling chocolate bar, and you guessed it\u2019s KitKat, which was\u2026 the wrong answer I\u2019m afraid, Neil. In fact, the UK\u2019s most popular chocolate is the Mars bar, meaning that over 3 million bars get made every day! OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with a dream , something you really want to happen but is not likely to, and the related idiom, a dream come true , when what you really want to happen actually does."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When a company launches a new consumer product, they introduce it to the public for the first time."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Consumer demand is a measurement of consumers\u2019 desire to buy a product based on factors like its price and availability."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When a product hits the shelves , it becomes available for purchase in the shops."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If you go for something, you choose it. For example, in a restaurant you might say, \u2018I think I\u2019ll go for the fish\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, if something is a flop , it\u2019s completely unsuccessful \u2013 a failure. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Ruth Alexander","Helle
