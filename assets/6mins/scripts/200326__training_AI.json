This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you like cooking, Sam? There\u2019s a new recipe I\u2019ve been trying out - it\u2019s for \u2018frosted oysters\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Frosted oysters?! Sounds\u2026 unusual. How do you make it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, take a pound of chicken, then some cubed pork and half a crushed garlic."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Eh? I thought you said it was for \u2018frosted oysters\u2019, whatever they are."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, that\u2019s right. Now heat it up until boiling and serve with custard."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ugh, that sounds disgusting! Who on earth told you that recipe?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s not \u2018who\u2019 told me, Sam, but \u2018what\u2019. In fact, that recipe was made by computers using artificial intelligence, or AI, which is the topic of today\u2019s programme. In real life, AI is making huge progress - from car satnavs to detecting cancer cells. But as you can see from that revolting recipe, things don\u2019t always go according to plan."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, just how intelligent is a rtificial intelligence? I mean, it definitely needs some cooking lessons!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. AI is not as intelligent as we tend to think. AI programmes use artificial brain cells to roughly imitate real brain cell activity, but they\u2019re still a long way behind human levels of intelligence. And that\u2019s my quiz question \u2013 in terms of brain cell count, what level of intelligence is AI currently working at? Is AI as smart as:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I don\u2019t think anyof those are good cooks either, to be honest. I\u2019ll say c) a bumblebee, because at least they can make honey!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Nice guess, Sam. We\u2019ll find out the answer later. But first let\u2019s find out more about how AI misunderstandings like the oyster recipe can happen. Janelle Shane is the author of \u2018You Look Like a Thing and I Love You\u2019 in which she tells her amusing experiences and bizarre experiments with AI."},{"author":"Sam","text":"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You \u2013 that\u2019s a strange title for a book, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes. It\u2019s another example of AI miscommunication. The book title is what a AI produced when asked to write chat-up lines \u2013 remarks men and women make to start up a conversation with someone they don\u2019t know but find attractive."},{"author":"Janelle Shane","text":"\u2018Machine learning\u2019 is what most programmers mean when they say \u2018AI\u2019. In the programme that we\u2019re used to, if you want to have a computer programme solve a problem you have to have a human programmer write down exhaustive step-by-step instructions on how to do everything. But with \u2018machine learning\u2019 you just give it the goal, and then the programme figures out via trial and error how it\u2019s going to solve that problem."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So even though we\u2019re talking about machines learning for themselves, there still need to be humans involved at the start of the journey. This human teaching is done by computer programmers \u2013 people who write, or code, the computer programmes used by AI."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. These programmers write algorithms \u2013 a set of rules or procedures to be followed in problem-solving exercises. So, for example, the AI that wrote that oyster recipe read thousands of other recipes before coming up with its own version."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In other words, Artificial intelligence uses a process of trial and error \u2013 repeating the same task over and over until finding the most successful way. Only in the case of the oyster recipe, there was more \u2018error\u2019 than \u2018trial\u2019!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, according to Janelle Shane, we can learn a lot about something by seeing how it goes wrong. Here she is, talking about an AI which had been told to solve maths problems:"},{"author":"Janelle Shane","text":"It seemed to be that it was getting scored on how many wrong answers it got, and it was supposed to be minimising the number of wrong answers, and just by a stroke of luck as part of its trial and error flailing around, one of the flails it did accidentally deleted the solutions list, and then it and everybody else got a perfect score."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, AIs learn by minimising their errors \u2013 reducing them as much as possible. And sometimes, these algorithms only discover the right answer by a stroke of luck \u2013 when something unexpected happens by good luck or chance. It seems to me that they\u2019re not so intelligent after all!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, let\u2019s settle it once and for all by answering today\u2019s quiz question. Remember I asked you how intelligent AI was in terms of brain cell count and you said, as intelligent as\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said c) a bumblebee."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, here\u2019s Janelle again with the answer\u2026"},{"author":"Janelle Shane","text":"If you\u2019re looking at rough computing power, the algorithms we\u2019re working with are probably somewhere around the level of an earthworm."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, the correct answer was b) as clever as an earthworm! No wonder AIs can\u2019t cook!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or take a maths test without cheating! In this programme we\u2019ve been looking at artificial intelligence, or AI, and seeing how programmers \u2013 that\u2019s people who write instructions for computers to follow create algorithms \u2013 sets of rules used in problem-solving."},{"author":"Sam","text":"AI learns through trial and error \u2013 repeating the same activity again and again until discovering the best way, and minimising \u2013 reducing as much as possible, the number of errors it makes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And success can be the result of a stroke of luck, when something unexpected happens purely by chance, although so far that hasn\u2019t helped AIs to write good chat-up lines \u2013 the flattering remarks people make to get to know someone they find attractive."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And AIs don\u2019t know much about cooking oysters either!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all from us from this programme. Be sure to join us again for more topical discussion and vocabulary at 6  Minute English for BBC Learning English. Bye for now!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bye."}],"authors":["","Neil","Sam","Janelle
