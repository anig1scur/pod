This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam. When we talk about climate change, we usually talk about the effects on the planet, or the economic consequences. But all the damage being done by climate change is also having an effect on our minds, our mental health."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Fires, heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, droughts\u2026 the list of climate emergencies goes on and on, and sometimes it all feels like doom and gloom \u2013 an idiom describing a situation that is very bad and without hope. This worry is leading to mental health problems, not just for the unfortunate people who experience climate events first-hand, but for us all."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll meet one expert who\u2019s investigating the link between climate change and mental health problems and hoping to find some solutions. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But before that I have a question for you, Sam. The 2021 UK census reported that three quarters of adults in Britain are worried about the impact of climate change, and it\u2019s a worry that\u2019s shared by the young. According to a survey by Greenpeace, what percentage of young people worldwide say they feel worried about climate change? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think the figure will be high among young people, so I\u2019ll say b) 84 per cent."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the correct answer later in the programme. The expert I mentioned earlier who\u2019s investigating this problem is Dr Gesche Huebner, senior researcher at University College London. Here Dr Huebner explains to BBC World Service programme, The Climate Question, what she\u2019s been finding out."},{"author":"Dr Gesche Huebner","text":"I think we have very clear evidence that, for example, hot temperatures - heat waves - are leading to an increased risk of suicide and also other adverse mental health effects. We also have pretty good evidence that, for example, experiencing a natural disaster - storms, flooding - are linked to negative mental health outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder or other anxiety issues."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Many people who experience a climate change event like flooding suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , often shortened to PTSD \u2013 a serious mental health disorder that can develop after a very bad experience like war, or natural disasters like a flood or fire."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But according to Dr Huebner, even people without direct experience can suffer anxiety issues about what the future holds for our planet. This is known as climate anxiety , sometimes called climate doom \u2013 a low-level feeling of nervousness or worry about the consequences of climate change."},{"author":"Sam","text":"These mental disorders are different in terms of how intense they feel, but Dr Huebner describes them both as adverse \u2013 having a harmful or negative effect."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In all this doom and gloom , it\u2019s easy to forget that many of the things which are good for fighting climate change are also good for mental health. Here\u2019s Dr Huebner again, talking with BBC World Service\u2019s, The Climate Question, this time focussing on positive things which can be done to help."},{"author":"Dr Gesche Huebner","text":"For example, if we get fossil fuel vehicles off the road we can improve the air quality, and we know that per se can be good for mental health. If we change our road infrastructure to enable more walking and cycling, again we have fewer\u2026  fossil fuel being burned but also, we know that walking and cycling are very good for mental health. If we can change our road layout and create more urban greenspaces, we already know that green and blue spaces are good for mental health."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Activities like walking and cycle reduce fossil fuels and improve air quality, but they are also good per se \u2013 a Latin term meaning \u2018in and of itself\u2019. Walking is good for climate reasons, but also good in itself \u2013 per se."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dr Huebner also recommends more urban greenspaces \u2013 open areas for parks, plants and wildlife which are built into the design of towns and cities. With creative thinking like this, it may still be possible for today\u2019s young people to have a planet worth living for. Speaking of which, Sam, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, you asked what percentage of young people worldwide report feeling anxious about climate change. I guessed it was 84 per cent."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which was the correct answer! Well done! It\u2019s a high percentage which is not surprising considering that it\u2019s future generations who will live with the consequences of what we do, or fail to do, today. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about climate anxiety \u2013 feelings of distress caused by worrying about climate change."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The idiom \u2018 doom and gloom\u2019 describes the feeling that a situation is very bad and without hope."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD isa serious mental illness that can develop as a result of a very bad experience, like a war or natural disaster."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The adjective adverse means having a harmful, negative effect."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The Latin phrase per se, means \u2018in itself\u2019 and is used when considering the qualities of something on its own, not in relation to something else."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, urban greenspaces are areas in towns and cities which are reserved for parks, trees and wildlife.
