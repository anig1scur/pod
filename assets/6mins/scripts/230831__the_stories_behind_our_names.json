This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Names tell us a lot about a person. Many names have meanings \u2013 Paul, for example, means \u2018humble\u2019, and the name, Anna, originated from a Hebrew word meaning \u2018graceful\u2019."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Our name is an important part of our identity - if you hear someone shout your name in the street, you automatically turn to look. But names also reveal cultural and family connections which give us a sense of our history and our place in the world."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be meeting a writer whose name combines two very different sides of her identity \u2013 one English, the other Indian. Sheela Banerjee was born in Hayes, West London to parents from the east Indian state of Bengal. We\u2019ll be hearing about Sheela\u2019s research into her name and family history, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But first I have a question for you, Neil. As every parent knows, choosing your child\u2019s name isn\u2019t easy. Names go in and out of fashion, and a name that was popular one year soon becomes old-fashioned. So, what was the most popular name for baby girls in the UK last year. Was it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm, I\u2019ll guess it was Olivia."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Neil, we\u2019ll find out the answer later in the programme. Sheela Banerjee\u2019s name came out of her parents\u2019 journey from British India to West London in the 1950s. Here she tells BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth, how reflecting on this journey inspired her new book, What\u2019s in a Name?, which blends her own life story with history and politics:"},{"author":"Sheela Banerjee","text":"\u2026as soon as I started thinking about it, you know, this name Sheela which is, you know, I was a 7 year-old girl living in Hayes called Sheela - this very typical English name - you know, what's that name doing there\u2026 if you start to pull at that the threads lead you to the story of my Bengali parents\u2019 migration over here, to mass migration from the colonies after the war to this country, and then Banerjee contains all these stories about colonialism and caste\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Her parents wanted their daughter to feel safe in London so they gave her a typical English name, Sheela. If something is typical it shows the usual features of a particular type of person or thing - it\u2019s a good example of that type."},{"author":"Beth","text":"She may have had a typical English name, but with dark skin and hair, Sheela didn\u2019t look like some people's image of a typical English girl. Wanting to find out more about her culture, Sheela started to pull the threads behind her family story. Pulling the threads is an idiom meaning to investigate deeper into something, revealing the hidden connections behind it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What Sheela discovered was a story of mass migration \u2013 periods in history when large groups of people move from one geographical area to another. Mass migrations have happened throughout history. In the 1950s and 1960s, many South Asian families, including Sheela\u2019s, migrated west to cities in the UK."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But this is just one half of the story. Sheela\u2019s family name, Banerjee, reflects her roots in the Bengali culture of East India where surnames tell a lot about a person\u2019s social status, or caste. Here\u2019s Sheela explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"},{"author":"Sheela Banerjee","text":"\u2026it is an Indian name, but actually it's not my real name\u2026 You've got names like Banerjee, Mukherjee, Chatterjee which, you know, nowadays people hear over here, but Banerjee is an anglicised form of my original name which would have been \u2018Bandyopadhyay\u2019 and it\u2019s a name that was changed by the British when they went over there because they really basically couldn't be bothered to pronounce it, or couldn't pronounce it, and for me it's always been a very mixed name because it signifies that we were, you know, colonial subjects and so it's a tricky name to be carrying around."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sheela\u2019s surname is actually pronounced \u2018Bandyopadhyay\u2019 but during colonial times the name became anglicised - it was changed to sound more English. This happened at lot: the surnames Chattopadhyay became Chatterjee and Mukhopadhyay became Mukherjee, either because the British rulers couldn\u2019t pronounce them, or because they couldn\u2019t be bothered \u2013 they didn\u2019t make the effort."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Sheela feels her anglicised surname has always been tricky - difficult to use, because of the association with colonialism and oppression. Ironically, it was London, the capital of the British Empire, that in modern times became the destination for migrants from all over the world."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question, Beth. What was the most popular girls\u2019 name in 2022? I guessed it was Olivia\u2026"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! In 2022, Olivia remained the most popular girls\u2019 name for the sixth year in a row, and was given to 3,649 baby girls. OK, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with typical \u2013 containing the most usual features of a particular type of person or thing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you pull the threads of something, you investigate it more deeply to find the hidden stories behind it."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Mass migration is the historical movement of large groups of people from one place to another."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If something is anglicised it\u2019s changed to sound or appear English."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If you can\u2019t be bothered to do something, you don\u2019t make the effort to do it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, if something is tricky, it\u2019s difficult to manage and requires careful use. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Sheela
