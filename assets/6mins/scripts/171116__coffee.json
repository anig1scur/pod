Welcome to Six Minute English where we engage in some lively debate and discuss six stimulating items of vocabulary! And let's start. Here's your cup of coffee, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thanks! But what took you so long, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Sorry Rob. I bumped into somebody I knew in the caf\u00e9 and stopped for a chat."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well, that fits well with today's show where we're talking about caf\u00e9s or coffee houses. Did you know, Catherine, that coffee houses were originally a meeting place for lively debate and intellectual discussion?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Really. I didn't know that, Rob. A debate , by the way, means a discussion that a lot of people take part in. So how long ago was this debating society?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"The first coffee house was set up in Oxford in 1650. But they quickly became popular and soon they were all over London too. You paid a penny to get in, and this included access to newspapers \u2013 and stimulating conversation!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"If something is stimulating it encourages ideas and enthusiasm. I expect the coffee helped with that a bit did it?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"It certainly helps me first thing in the morning."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Which brings me on to today's question, Rob! How many cups of coffee do we consume in coffee shops or stores in the UK every year? Consume , by the way, is another word for eat or drink. Is it\u2026 a) 2.3 million b) 23 million or c) 23 billion?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh I don't know but it's got to be a lot so I'm going to go for c) 23 billion? That sounds like a lot of coffee, but I buy several cups a week \u2013 and I expect you do too, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I do indeed. But I have to say, while I was getting our coffees earlier, there was nobody else in the caf\u00e9 talking except me and my friend. Everybody was sitting on their own, tapping away on their laptops. Let's listen now to Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor, describing the vibe \u2013 or atmosphere \u2013 in a typical 21st century caf\u00e9\u2026"},{"author":"Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor","text":"Ten or so in the morning, the caf\u00e9 has five people at tables with their backs to the wall, each staring into a screen, plugged in, ears plugged. The flow of bytes through this coffee shop's free wifi is transporting these customers to diverse destinations far from the person beside them. Collaborative working, a research grant application, a potential blockbuster novel, and inevitably, someone distracted by kitten pictures on social media."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So the spirit of those 17th century coffee houses has disappeared then? No more lively debate and intellectual discussion?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"It seems so Rob. As Douglas Fraser says, many people sit alone plugged into their laptops \u2013 and they're all doing different things \u2013 working, writing, messing about on social media."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I think the caf\u00e9 owners should turn off the free wifi and force these caf\u00e9 squatters to move on! I don't think people should be allowed to sit all day using the internet \u2013 hogging tables \u2013 and not talking to anybody! Especially when some of them don't even buy a coffee!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That's a bit extreme, Rob. Caf\u00e9 owners need customers \u2013 and they encourage people to stay by having comfy sofas and newspapers to read and the free wifi! A squatter , by the way, is someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. And if you hog something you use most or all of it in a selfish way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I suppose you're right. Now, how about telling us the answer to today's question then?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I asked: How many cups of coffee do we consume in caf\u00e9s or stores in the UK every year? Is it\u2026 a) 2.3 million b) 23 million or c) 23 billion?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I could sit in a cafe and use their free wifi to research the answer but I had a guess and said 23 billion."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well you didn't need that free wifi Rob because you were absolutely right! 23 billion coffees per year works out on average as 45 cups per adult in the UK."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, I think it's time we looked back at the words we learned today. Our first word is 'debate' \u2013 a discussion that a lot of people take part in."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"For example, 'I took part in a number of stimulating debates at school.' Number two \u2013 if something is 'stimulating', it encourages new ideas and enthusiasm. For example, 'It's hard to have a stimulating conversation with someone who's looking at their phone all the time.'"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That's very true \u2013 let me just slide my phone into my pocket\u2026 there! Our next word is 'consume' \u2013 another word for eating or drinking \u2013 but it can also mean 'to use'. For example, 'My car consumes a lot of petrol.'"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Or, 'How do I calculate my car's fuel consumption?' So 'consumption' there is the noun.Number four is \u2013 'vibe' \u2013 which means the mood or atmosphere in a place. For example, 'Oxford is a city but it has a small-town vibe.'"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I'm getting bad vibes from our next word \u2013 which is 'squatter' \u2013 that's someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. The building is called a 'squat' so for example, 'I lived in a squat for two years.'"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Really? You squatted in a squat, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"No, it was just an example. I'm not a squatter."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"You've never squatted?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"No I haven't. Look we're wasting time here! We need to move on to our final word \u2013 hog. If you 'hog' something, you use all or most of it in a selfish way."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"For example, 'Rob! You've hogged the only comfy chair! That is so selfish!'"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I admit it, Catherine. I'm a chair hog. That's the noun. OK, before we head off for another cup of coffee please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages."},{"author":"Catherine/Rob","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Catherine","Rob","Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy
