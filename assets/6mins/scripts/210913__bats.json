This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For centuries the relationship between humans and bats has been complex. In some cultures, bats are depicted as vampires, associated with Halloween, witches and dark, scary places. In others, they are considered messengers of the gods."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bats play an important part in stories and myths from around the world. And a large illuminated \u2018bat signal\u2019 shining in the night sky can mean only one thing \u2013 a call for help to the superhero, Batman!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So do we love or hate these furry flying mammals? And with some newspaper headlines identifying bats as the possible source of Covid-19, should we think of them as friend or enemy?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ll be answering all these questions soon, but first, Neil, time for another interesting bat fact. Did you know that bats account for 1 in 5 of all mammal species? There\u2019s a huge variety of them, from tiny fruit-eating bats that fit into the palm of your hand to giant carnivores , or meat-eaters, with nearly two-metre wingspans."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right. In fact, it\u2019s the variety of bat types that might explain our complex feelings towards them. So, Sam, my quiz question is this: roughly how many different species of bat are there worldwide? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, I\u2019ll say b) two and a half thousand."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll come back to that later in the programme. Maybe not everyone likes them, but bats do have some friends. Farmers love them for pollinating their plants\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2026and medical scientists study them hoping to discover the secrets of their anti-ageing and long life."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Winifred Frick is the chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, a group of environmentalists working to protect bats."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here she is telling BBC World Service programme, The Documentary, about another useful service provided by bats in the United States:"},{"author":"Dr Winifred Frick","text":"Most bats are insectivorous and they\u2019re really important consumers of different kinds of insect pests and here in the United States it\u2019s been estimated that bats provide billions of dollars every year to the US agricultural industry through their voracious consumption of agricultural pest insects."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Most bats eat only insects \u2013 they\u2019re insectivores ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s good news for farmers because they eat many pests - insects or small animals that are harmful or damage crops."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even better, bats\u2019 appetite for these annoying insects is voracious \u2013 very strong and eager."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So far, so good in the friendship between humans and bats. But then along came the coronavirus pandemic and with it, newspaper reports that bats might be to blame."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Before we get into this, we need to explain some terms. The Covid which people around the world have been suffering from is the \u2018outbreak virus\u2019. But if you go backwards there\u2019s an intermediary known as the \u2018progenitor virus\u2019 between this and the \u2018ancestral virus\u2019, which is decades or centuries older."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ninety-nine percent of scientists would agree that the \u2018ancestral virus\u2019 of Covid-19 came from bats. But it\u2019s the go-between \u2018progenitor virus\u2019 that everyone is searching for now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One of the scientists leading this search is Linfa Wang, a professor at Duke Medical School who is known as the \u2018Batman of Singapore\u2019. Here he is explaining his work to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Documentary:"},{"author":"Prof Linfa Wang","text":"Of course the holy grail right now for Covid-19 is to discover where is that progenitor virus and also in which kind of animals or humans, right? And usually, the progenitor virus has to be 99.9% identical to the outbreak virus and so our study was set up to do that. If you can catch that virus and you demonstrate the genomic sequence is 99.9% [identical] then that\u2019s brilliant ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Professor Wang thinks that finding the source of Covid-19\u2019s \u2018progenitor virus\u2019 would be like finding the holy grail . This expression - the holy grail - is associated with the cup believed to have been used by Jesus Christ at his last meal. It means something extremely difficult to find or get."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you can discover the \u2018progenitor virus\u2019 then, in the words of Professor Wang \u2013 that\u2019s brilliant! \u2013 an exclamation meaning \u2018that\u2019s very good!\u2019 or \u2018amazing!\u2019"},{"author":"Sam","text":"So although bats are sometimes, wrongly, blamed for causing Covid, they are good friends to farmers, environmentalists and scientists \u2013 as well as vampires! Are bats friend or foe? You decide. So anyway, what was the answer to your quiz question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, I asked Sam: How many different species of bat are there around the world? What did you say?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said there were, b) two and a half thousand different species of bats. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were close, Sam, but the correct answer was\u2026 a) there are one and a half thousand different species of bats around the world. With so many I guess some of them might be friendlier than others."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme about the relationship between humans and bats, starting with carnivores which are animals that eat meat\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Insectivores , meanwhile, are animals, like most bats, that eat only insects."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A pest is an insect or small animal that is harmful or damages crops."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bats eat pests voraciously , or very eagerly."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The holy grail refers to something that\u2019s extremely difficult to find or get."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, you can use the phrase, that\u2019s brilliant! to say, \u2018that\u2019s great!\u2019 or \u2018amazing!\u2019"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Once again our six minutes are up. See you again soon for more topical chats and trending vocabulary here at 6 Minute English."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And don\u2019t forget you can download our app to find programmes on many more topics, from African animals to zodiac signs and zombies, all here on the BBC Learning English website.
