Are you a fan?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of tattoos? Well, I don\u2019t have one, but they can be quite impressive works of art."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I\u2019m not that keen on tattoos \u2013 I mean, who wants things drawn on their body?!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"It sounds like you need some convincing, Rob! Maybe our discussion today will change your mind."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Maybe. But as you\u2019re a fan of them, here\u2019s a question for you to answer. According to the Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand. Do you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, it\u2019s got to be 100% if he is the most tattooed man, surely?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Not necessarily, but, we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. Now let\u2019s talk more about tattoos. I know many people have them. Sometimes it\u2019s a picture of an animal, like a small gecko, sometimes it\u2019s words like \u2018I love you\u2019 or the name of a loved one. And then there are the huge designs spread across someone\u2019s back, chest or arm - like footballer David Beckham has."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, he\u2019s no stranger to a tattoo parlour. A parlour is the name of the shop where a tattoo artist draws a tattoo on you with ink and a needle."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Needles! Ouch!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, you need some convincing, so let\u2019s hear from Lucie Parfitt, YouTuber and tattoo fan. Here she is speaking on the BBC\u2019s Smart Consumer podcast\u2026"},{"author":"Lucie Parfitt, YouTuber","text":"I\u2019m quite a creative person and ever since I first discovered tattoos, I thought it was a really cool way of expressing yourself . I\u2019m quite a visual person as well, so for me it really, like, just looked really cool and it made me think more about my own, like, personality and how I could express that in creative ways . Rob Right, so, Lucie describes herself as a creative person. When you\u2019re creative you imaginative and like to experiment with new ideas."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, Rob. And tattoos are a good way to be creative \u2013 trying out different designs and colours - it\u2019s a good way to express yourself.  Here, to express yourself means 'to show how you feel in a particular way'."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, so some people express themselves through singing or wearing particular clothing, but here she\u2019s expressing herself through the images on her skin. But what happens if you want change what you want to express?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, then it\u2019s time for a new tattoo!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well I know that the tattoo industry is big business now \u2013 which means it's 'popular and making lots of money'. I\u2019ve heard that one in five people now have a tattoo."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Not you yet, Rob! But it has certainly become a trend in recent years and it\u2019s something tattoo artist Lee Clements has noticed. Also speaking on the BBC\u2019s Smart Consumer podcast, he explains why he thinks that is\u2026."},{"author":"Lee Clements, tattoo artist","text":"The thing for me that has obviously changed massively over the last, possibly, ten years is you see a lot of celebrities getting tattooed. With that comes the fact that you\u2019re going to get people who want to copy them or it becomes almost like a fashion thing, so we do see certain tattoos, sort of , becoming a trend and\u2026 yeah, so I guess it kind of dilutes that value a little bit, yeah."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah so it\u2019s celebrities \u2013 famous, well-known people from TV, film and fashion \u2013 that have possibly driven the trend. People want to copy them \u2013 or it\u2019s what he says is \u2018a fashion thing\u2019, so you have a tattoo because it\u2019s fashionable, which means it\u2019s 'popular at a particular time'."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And one of the down sides \u2013 the negative things \u2013 about just having one to be fashionable is it dilutes the individuality of having one. Dilute means to 'make something less strong or less valuable'."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I\u2019m not going to get one anytime soon \u2013 except maybe a big six on my arm to remind me that we only have 6 minutes for this programme so I\u2019d better reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier. According to Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand. Did you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said 100%."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well done, Sam. That is correct. He has held the certified record since 2006 of being 100% tattooed. This includes tattoos inside his eyelids, mouth and ears."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Wow! I wonder who gets to see those!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK well, now it\u2019s time to recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed today starting with a parlour ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s the name for a shop or room where certain businesses carry out their trade \u2013 such as a tattoo parlour, a massage parlour or an ice cream parlour."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A creative person is someone who uses imagination and experiments with new ideas."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And when you express yourself , it means you 'show outwardly how you feel and what you\u2019re thinking'."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If something is big business it is an activity that is currently popular and making lots of money."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And something that is fashionable is popular . And when something becomes popular it can dilute its value or uniqueness \u2013 so it becomes less strong or less valuable."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, thank you, Sam.  That\u2019s all for now but there\u2019s plenty more on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. If you can\u2019t remember the address, why not tattoo it on your arm?!
