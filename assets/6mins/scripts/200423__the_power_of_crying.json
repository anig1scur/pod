This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you cry easily, Sam? I mean, when was the last time you cried?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Let me think\u2026 Last week watching a movie, probably. I was watching a really dramatic film and in one scene, the heroine gets separated from her children. I just burst out crying. How about you Neil - when was the last time you cried?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Men don\u2019t cry, Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Come on, Neil! That\u2019s a bit stereotypical, isn\u2019t it? \u2013 the idea that men don\u2019t show their emotions and women cry all the time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s an interesting point, Sam, because in today\u2019s programme we\u2019re discussing crying. We\u2019ll be investigating the reasons why we cry and looking at some of the differences between men and women and between crying in public and in private. And of course, we\u2019ll be learning some related vocabulary along the way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guess it\u2019s kind of true that women do cry more than men. People often think crying is only about painful feelings but we also cry to show joy and when we are moved by something beautiful like music or a painting."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, maybe women are just more in touch with their feelings and that\u2019s why they cry more. Well actually, Sam, that brings me to our quiz question. According to a study from 2017 conducted in the UK, on average, how many times a year do women cry? Is it: a)     52 b)     72,   or c)     102"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmm, it's a tricky question, Neil. I mean, there are so many different reasons why people cry. And what makes me cry might make someone else laugh. I think some of my female friends probably cry around once a week, so I\u2018ll guess the answer is  a) 52."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam. We\u2019ll find out later if you were right. Now, while it may be true that men cry less often, it also seems that they feel less embarrassed about crying in public."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This may be because of differences in how men and women think others will view their public displays of emotion. Here\u2019s BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour speaking to therapist Joanna Cross about the issue of crying at work."},{"author":"Joanna Cross","text":"Let\u2019s take the workplace. If you\u2019ve got somebody who seems to cry regularly, I think that\u2019s not helpful for the individual because then if they cry over something that really is important to them, they might not be taken so seriously - or they get a label. But I do think crying is often a build-up of frustration and undealt-with situations and it\u2019s a bit of a final straw moment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So people who regularly cry at work risk not being taken seriously \u2013 not being treated as deserving attention or respect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And they might even get a label \u2013 become thought of as having a particular character whether that\u2019s true or not. Here\u2019s Joanna Cross again:"},{"author":"Joanna Cross","text":"You build up your resentments , your lack of boundaries, not being able to say \u2018no\u2019 and then somebody says, \u2018Can you go and make a cup of tea?\u2019 and you suddenly find yourself weeping . And everybody says, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019 but actually that\u2019s often a backlog of situations."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, a common reason for crying at work seems to be a build-up of resentments - feelings of anger when you think you have been treated unfairly or have been forced to accept something you don\u2019t like."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When left undealt with, these feelings can create a backlog - an accumulation of issues that you should have dealt with before but didn\u2019t."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. And then, like Joanna says, someone asks you to do something very simple and easy, like make a cup of tea, and you start weeping \u2013 another word for crying."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s a good example of a final straw moment, a term which comes from the expression, \u2018The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019. The final straw means a further problem which itself might be insignificant but which finally makes you want to give up."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I hope this programme won\u2019t be the final straw for us, Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I doubt it, Neil. The only time I cry at work is when you used to bring in your onion sandwiches for lunch. In fact, I can feel a tear rolling down my cheek right now\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, so that counts as one of your cries, Sam. Remember, I asked you on average how many times a year women in the UK cry \u2013 and you said?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said a) 52."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, don\u2019t cry when I tell you that you were wrong. The actual answer was c) 72 times a year."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which on average is more than men, but less than parents of new-born babies, both mothers and fathers. They cry almost as much as their babies!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Today, we\u2019ve been talking about crying \u2013 or weeping, as it\u2019s sometimes called."},{"author":"Sam","text":"People who often cry at work risk not being taken seriously \u2013 not treated as deserving of attention or respect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This means they might get a label \u2013 becoming known as someone with a particular kind of personality, even though that may not be true."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But crying is also a healthy way of expressing emotions. It can help deal with resentments \u2013 feelings of anger that you have been treated unfairly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If we don\u2019t deal with these feelings in some way, they can grow into a backlog \u2013 an accumulation of unresolved issues that you now need to deal with."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And if you don\u2019t deal with them, you might become a ticking bomb waiting to explode. Then anything someone says to you can become the final straw \u2013 the last small problem which makes you want to give up and maybe start crying."},{"author":"Neil","text":"[Crying]"},{"author":"Sam","text":"What\u2019s the matter, Neil? Was it something I said?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, Sam \u2013 I\u2019m crying because it\u2019s the end of the programme!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ahh, don\u2019t worry because we\u2019ll be back soon for another edition of 6 Minute English.
