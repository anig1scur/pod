In the 1830s he visited the Galapagos, a string of islands in the Pacific Ocean famous because of the unique animals living there. Rob It was while in the Galapagos, observing small birds called finches, that Darwin started forming his theory of evolution . But today, the animals of the Galapagos face the same pressures as animals across the world because of the effects of man-made climate change."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Warming sea waters and more frequent extreme weather events are affecting animals as much as humans, so, in this programme, we\u2019ll be asking \u2018can animals evolve to deal with climate change?\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"But first I have a question for you, Sam, and it\u2019s about Charles Darwin\u2019s trip to the Galapagos. In 1831, Darwin set sail around the world, collecting samples of flora and fauna , the plants and animals, of the places he visited.

HMS Victory."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Are you sure?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"No."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Now, it may have been the Galapagos finches that started Charles Darwin thinking about how animals adapt to their environment but, as naturalist, Kiyoko Gotanda explained to BBC World Service programme The Climate Question, Darwin\u2019s first impression of the small birds wasn\u2019t very good:"},{"author":"Kiyoko Gotanda","text":"When Darwin got to the Galapagos Islands, he actually wasn\u2019t that interested in the finches \u2013 they were kind of a drab colour and didn\u2019t have a very interesting song. He sampled, though, the finches from different islands, and so when he got back to England he was looking at all the variation in beak shape and size, and body size and shape, and he was recalling how certain finches were found on certain islands but not on other islands"},{"author":"Rob","text":"In contrast to more colourful birds like Galapagos parrots, the finches Darwin observed were drab , dull and boring-looking, with little colour."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Instead, what Darwin noticed were variations in the finches\u2019 beak \u2013 the hard, pointed part of a bird\u2019s mouth. Finches born with a beak that could help them get more food were more likely to survive and have babies. Over time, as the birds passed on their successful genes, they adapted to fit in with their environment \u2013 what we know as evolution ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, if animals can evolve to survive their environment, can they also evolve to cope with the impact humans are having on the climate?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, there\u2019s already some evidence to show they can. Studies on birds in the Brazilian Amazon and red deer on the Isle of Rum, in Scotland, show warmer temperatures have caused animals to evolve smaller bodies.

Thor checked other areas of the Caribbean where hurricanes were frequent and found the same traits in lizards there, proof of evolution in action.
