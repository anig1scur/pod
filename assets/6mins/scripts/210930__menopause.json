The menopause is a natural part of ageing that happens as a woman\u2018s hormones decline and she stops having monthly periods and being able to get pregnant naturally."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"With the menopause comes physical signs. These vary from person to person and often include hot flushes, mood swings and night sweats. But besides these there may be other changes too and living through it can be isolating, both personally and professionally."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In many societies, the menopause is still taboo \u2013 not talked about in public for social or religious reasons, or because people are uncomfortable discussing it"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But recently high-profile women like former First Lady, Michelle Obama, have started speaking up.

But first let me ask you my quiz question, Georgina. As we mentioned, the menopause is part of the natural ageing process and usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. But what is the average age for a woman to reach the menopause in Britain? Is it: a)    49? b)    51? or c)    53?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I\u2019ll jump in the middle and say 51 years old."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out the answer later in the programme."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Since the menopause is a normal and natural part of life it\u2019s surprising how little it\u2019s talked about. Dr Nighat Arif is a British Pakistani family doctor specialising in women\u2019s health. According to her, the silence around the subject is because menopause is about getting old, something no one wants to be reminded of."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here is Dr Arif explaining more to BBC World Service programme, The Conversation:"},{"author":"Dr Nighat Arif","text":"Historically, particularly when it comes to women, the older you are you\u2019re surplus to excess now, that\u2019s it, you\u2019ve done your dues, you\u2019ve had your children, your use isn\u2019t needed anymore in society\u2026 but actually women are not like that at all, women are far more becoming productive in the career and workspace and they are the caregivers, sometimes they are actually the financial providers in their home setting as well."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In many cultures, the traditional role of women is to have children. Dr Arif says that after doing this, women may be considered to have done - or paid - their dues \u2013 an expression meaning to do everything you are expected to do, or to have done your duty."},{"author":"Sam","text":"After raising children, women are sometimes thought to be surplus to excess, something which is more than needed, or in other words, surplus to requirements \u2013 a phrase meaning \u2018no longer required\u2019."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Of course, this isn\u2019t true for all women everywhere, but it is surprising how unequal men and women\u2019s experience of getting older can be.

So, if women are entering that age range, 45 and over, they\u2019re already possibly feeling the effects of ageism, you know, pointing in their direction. And then when they add on this layer of having physical symptoms that can impact how they\u2019re functioning at work and even at home - it\u2019s a double whammy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"For Barbara Hannah Grufferman, one of the biggest barriers women face is ageism - the unfair treatment of older people because of their age."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Just as racism and sexism discriminate against people because of their race or gender, ageism values older people less than the young."},{"author":"Sam","text":"As we mentioned before, the menopause brings physical signs such as hot flushes or night sweats. These signs are known as symptoms - things wrong with your body or mind that are signs of some illness or bodily process."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So menopausal women suffer physical symptoms, as well as possibly dealing with discrimination based on their age.
