But first it\u2019s time for our quiz question. One of the first adventure stories to fire the public\u2019s imagination about the underwater world was the 1870 novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. But who wrote this underwater classic? Was it: a) H G Wells?, b) Arthur Conan Doyle?, or c) Jules Verne?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I think I know this one, Neil. Wasn\u2019t it, a) H G Wells?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Rob, we\u2019ll find out later if you\u2019re right. Now, one of the most ambitious designs for an underwater city is Ocean Spiral , a huge transparent globe attached to the seabed \u2013 the solid ground which lies deep below the sea level."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The top of the globe stands above the surface of the ocean and running through the centre is a tower to add strength, and to provide space for homes, offices and even an amusement park for five thousand underwater residents."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ocean Spiral has been dreamt up by the Japanese Shimizu Corporation. Here\u2019s Shimizu engineer, Maksaki Takeuchi, explaining to BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience , the motivation behind the idea:"},{"author":"Masaki Takeuchi","text":"At the moment the world is facing a lot of serious problems regarding food, energy, water, natural resources ... however we are trying to solve the issues just by using our land. Our idea is to connect the sea surface and the deep sea vertically and that way we believe that we can utilise the capability of the deep sea and that\u2019s the purpose of this whole project."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The effects of human activity on the land have led some to look to the oceans for natural resources - naturally existing things such as minerals, oil, coal and other energy sources that can be used by people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This search deep underwater is happening vertically - at a ninety degree angle straight up or down from the ground, as opposed to horizontally, or flat across the Earth\u2019s surface."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But as yet, Shimizu Corporation\u2019s plans for an underwater city are still in the planning stages - no part of the project has yet been built and the total cost is thought to exceed 26 billion dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In fact, the longest anyone has spent living under the sea is only 73 days. That record was set by Roger Garcia, ex-military diver and head of The Aquarius , currently the world\u2019s only underwater research station."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Here\u2019s Roger Garcia, explaining to BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience , what happens to the human body after living underwater for so long:"},{"author":"Roger Garcia","text":"\u2026perhaps a change in their voice, not much \u2018cos we\u2019re not very deep, that\u2019s because the air becomes denser. Physiologically the most important thing though, is that since you are in this case at two and a half times atmospheric pressure you do take on more inner gas, and in this case - inside The Aquarius we just breathe normal air - you\u2019re gonna take on more nitrogen and depending on how long you stay in The Aquarius , that\u2019s going to incur some sort of decompressed obligation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In addition to engineering challenges, living underwater for long periods of time also affects the human body. One example is the bends \u2013 or decompression sickness, a serious medical disorder created by nitrogen bubbles in the muscles when returning to the surface of the sea too quickly."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The bends , and changes to the voice, are examples of how underwater living changes the body physiologically \u2013 relating to how the bodies of living humans and animals function."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As divers descend deep below the ocean\u2019s surface, there is an increase in atmospheric pressure \u2013 the normal air pressure within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The deeper they dive, the higher the pressure. Physiological reactions like the bends are caused by divers incorrectly readjusting to normal atmospheric pressure ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Neil, with so many difficulties, it\u2019s no surprise that H G Wells's fantasy of living under the sea is still science-fiction."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, but are you sure it was H G Wells, Rob? In my quiz question I asked you who wrote the classic underwater adventure Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, and I said a) H G Wells."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer! It was, in fact, c) Jules Verne, the French author who also wrote Around the World in Eighty Days."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ve been discussing the challenge of living underwater, going down vertically \u2013 at a 90 degree angle \u2013 to the seabed \u2013 the solid ground hundreds of metres under the sea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ocean explorers search underwater for natural resources \u2013 useful materials like coal and oil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But they face many physiological problems \u2013 problems relating to how the human body functions, such as the bends \u2013 a painful medical condition caused by returning too quickly to atmospheric pressure \u2013 the Earth\u2019s usual air pressure."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme, but we hope you\u2019ll be diving back into 6 Minute English very soon.
