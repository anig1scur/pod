I'm Rob\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026 and I'm Neil. Hello."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hello, Neil! Today we're talking about evolution. Now the man most people think of when talking about evolution is of course Charles Darwin. He was a bit of a genius, wasn\u2019t he?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"He was. Evolution means the way living things change and develop over millions of years. And a genius has great and unusual skills or abilities in a particular subject or area. Well Charles Darwin was a clever man but I happen to know that another man actually came up with the same idea, but many years before he did!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"So how do you know that then, clever clogs \u2013 that's someone who thinks they know everything? What was his name?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, his name was Patrick Matthew."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well we\u2019re going to learn more about him on today\u2019s programme. But first can you answer this, Neil? What was Patrick Matthew\u2019s job? Was he \u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I don\u2019t know so I'll go for the most profession that sounds most interesting - a horticulturalist, so I\u2019ll choose that one! That\u2019s a person who studies plants."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. We\u2019ll find out later whether you are right or wrong. But let\u2019s listen now to Dr Mike Weale talking about Patrick Matthew. Can you hear the word he uses to mean 'change-making'?..."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Mike Weale, geneticist at King\u2019s College London He published a brief outline of the idea of species being able to change into other species through natural selection \u2013 this great, transformative idea that unites us all in a single tree of life. And he did that 27 years before Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace did so. And they recognized that he did so but other people since then have simplified the story and tended to concentrate just on Darwin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, Matthew believed that evolution happened by natural selection. And natural selection describes the way that plants and animals adapt to their environment, because some individuals survive and reproduce, and others don\u2019t."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And adapt means the way our bodies or our behaviour change to suit new conditions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And what does Mike mean by \u2018a single tree of life\u2019?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, the basic idea behind evolution is that all the different species \u2013 or types of living thing \u2013 have evolved from the same simple life form. Just like a family tree describes how the members of your family are related to each other, so the \u2018tree of life\u2019 describes how all living things are related."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So if this was a transformative \u2013 or change-making \u2013 idea, why don\u2019t more of us know about Patrick Matthew?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"A good question, Neil. We heard in the clip that Darwin acknowledged \u2013 or accepted - Matthew\u2019s claim to the idea. But it seems to be down to us \u2013 the general public \u2013 wanting to simplify things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I like to keep things simple, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You don\u2019t have to tell me that, Neil. But let\u2019s hear more on why Matthew might have been passed over \u2013 or ignored \u2013 by some. Here\u2019s Dr Patricia Fara, senior tutor at Clare College Cambridge. She tells us why Darwin was so successful. And listen out for the word she uses to mean close friends and supporters."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Patricia Fara, Senior Tutor at Clare College Cambridge He brought his allies on board. And although he was publishing from his stronghold down in Kent he had the most famous, most prominent, eminent members of the scientific society in Victorian times who were pushing on his behalf. Having a scientific theory being accepted is not just a matter of whether the theory\u2019s right."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The word she used was allies. What are they Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Allies are people who help or support us in something - having someone on board also means to have someone\u2019s support for an idea or project. And Darwin\u2019s allies weren\u2019t just mates from down the pub, were they?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"No, they weren\u2019t! They were famous, prominent and eminent scientists. Prominent means important and well-known and eminent means important and respected."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes! So you could say that I\u2019m an eminent radio presenter, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I could Neil, but\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, OK, OK moving on! These eminent scientists were pushing on Darwin\u2019s behalf. In other words, they were taking strong action to promote his theory of evolution."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And it\u2019s possible that Patrick Matthew did not enjoy the same level of support."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That could be true. So do you remember the quiz question from the beginning of the show, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Indeed I do! I asked: What was Matthew\u2019s job? Was he \u2026 a) a politician? b) a church minister? Or c) a horticulturalist?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said c) horticulturalist."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. And that was the right answer \u2013 so well done! Just to remind you: a horticulturalist is a person whose job is to study and grow plants such as flowers, fruit and vegetables. But Matthew was interested in trees too. In fact, his ideas about evolution appear in an appendix \u2013 or section giving extra information \u2013 at the end of a 200-page book about wood!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So maybe that\u2019s why we know Darwin\u2019s name but not Matthew\u2019s. It doesn\u2019t seem fair."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, life\u2019s not fair, Neil. You should know that by now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I should, I should\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"So why don\u2019t we hear the words we learned today?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Here we go:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thank you, Neil. Well, that\u2019s the end of today's 6 Minute English. There are plenty more to listen to at bbclearningenglish.com .
