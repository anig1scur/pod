Cornwall, the region which forms the south-western tip of Britain, is as famous for its pasties as New York is for hot dogs. In this programme we\u2019ll be finding out all about Cornish pasties. We\u2019ll hear how it\u2019s gone from humble beginnings to become a symbol of Cornish identity and spread around the world to Jamaica, Argentina and Brazil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But what exactly is a pasty, Neil?

What is the traditional filling in an authentic Cornish pasty? Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, chorizo is Spanish isn\u2019t it? And avocado with brie doesn\u2019t sound traditionally Cornish, so I\u2019ll say b) beef, potato and turnip."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Rob. We\u2019ll find out later if you were right. What\u2019s for sure is that the Cornish pasty has had a long history as BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme discovered. They spoke to Dr Polly Russell, a public life curator at the British Library. Here she is reading from one of the earliest mentions of pasties from the late 17th century:"},{"author":"Polly Russell, Public Life Curator, British Library","text":"There\u2019s a lovely bit here where he\u2019s describing what a housewife in Hertfordshire does and he\u2019s talking about her way to make pork pies and pork pasties: pies may be made and baked either raised in paste earthen pans or in pewter dishes or in the shape of a turnover, two-cornered pasties. So that\u2019s a very early reference to a pasty in the shape, I think, that we know it but also being made specifically for labourers - to be feeding labourers on a farm at harvest time."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The earliest pasties were made in pewter dishes \u2013 a traditional cooking plate made of a silver-coloured metal called \u2018pewter\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And they were eaten by agricultural labourers \u2013 workers doing physical farm work during harvest time \u2013 the weeks in autumn when crops like wheat are cut and collected from the fields."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But it wasn\u2019t only farmers and labourers who ate pasties. As well as its farms and fishing, Cornwall was famous for tin mines, as Ruth Huxley of the Cornish Pasty Association explains:"},{"author":"Ruth Huxley, Cornish Pasty Association","text":"Pasties would have been eaten by lots of people who went to work but it just worked perfectly down mines, and Cornwall became the world capital of mining. And so lots of pasties were made, lots of pasties were eaten and then that mining community went all over the world and took the pasty with them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Pasties were eaten by hungry workers involved in the mining industry - digging up materials such as coal or metals like gold, or in Cornwall tin, from the ground."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So far we\u2019ve been talking about Cornwall. But you said the Cornish pasty has spread around the world, Neil. How did that happen?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s connected to the tin miners we just talked about. Here\u2019s Polly Russell again:"},{"author":"Polly Russell, Public Life Curator, British Library","text":"This is r eplicated , not just in Mexico but with migrants moving to America, to Minnesota, to Canada, to Australia. So anyone who travels to many of those places now will see foods which are incredibly reminiscent and familiar and just like Cornish pasties."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the 19th century, many Cornish tin miners emigrated, moving abroad to start a better life. Their pasty recipes were replicated \u2013 or copied exactly, in the new places where they landed, from America to Australia."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And that\u2019s why in many places around the world you can find food which is reminiscent of pasties \u2013 meaning it reminds you of something similar, in this case the original Cornish pasty\u2026 with its traditional filling of\u2026 what\u2019s was your quiz question again, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, yes. I asked you what the traditional Cornish pasty filling was? You said\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said b) beef, potato and turnip."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you were right! \u2018Keslowena\u2019, Rob \u2013 that\u2019s Cornish for \u2018congratulations\u2019!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"\u2018Heb grev\u2019, Neil \u2013 that\u2019s \u2018no problem\u2019!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In fact those other fillings \u2013 chorizo, avocado and brie - really did feature in pasties entered for this year\u2019s Annual World Pasty Championships, held in Cornwall every spring. Other pasty-inspired ideas include Argentinian chimichurri empanadas and spicy Jamaican patties."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So the pasty is still going strong, both in Cornwall and around the world."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Today we\u2019ve been discussing Cornish pasties \u2013 a kind of filled pastry from the south-west of England, originally made in pewter dishes \u2013 a silver-coloured metal dish."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Pasties were eaten by agricultural labourers \u2013 farm workers bringing in the autumn harvest \u2013 the time when crops are cut and collected from the fields, and also by workers in the tin mining industry \u2013 digging up metals like tin from underground."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Later, when these miners emigrated to new lands, pasties were replicated \u2013 cooked again in the same way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In fact Cornish miners moved to so many new countries that today, almost every corner of the world has food reminiscent of \u2013 or reminding you of, the original Cornish pasty."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for today.
