Now, all over the world people love to eat, and most of us have favourite food we like to cook. Often, this involves a recipe \u2013 that\u2019s written down instructions explaining how you combine the different items of food you are going to cook - the ingredients \u2013 into a meal. My favourite recipe is for bangers and mash - a cheap and popular British meal made of sausage and mashed potato."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Cooking is a big part of our lives, something pleasurable we do with others, and a way of discovering the flavours and tastes of other cultures."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be doing just that \u2013 discovering the food culture of Ghana in west Africa, and hearing about one woman\u2019s quest to preserve her country\u2019s traditional recipes.

Your favourite recipe is the classic British dish, bangers and mash.

Food writer, Abena Offeh-Gyimah, was born in Ghana but moved to Canada as a child. After school she would go for burgers and fries with friends, before heading home to eat traditional Ghanaian food with her family, food cooked with ingredients like dawadawa, a spice made from roasting locust beans, and fufu."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Her mother\u2019s cooking gave Abena a love of traditional recipes - so much so that five years ago, she moved back to Ghana to rediscover her country\u2019s food culture. But when she arrived, Abena was surprised how much things had changed. Many traditional spices and ingredients were no longer being used, and it was more common to see tomato ketchup than Ghanaian chipotle sauce."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here Abena describes how her grandparents used to cook in the old days, to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain."},{"author":"Abena Offeh-Gyimah","text":"So, they would actually cook the yam, they would cook the plantain, and they would use, you know, the mortar and pestle to actually pound it, you know. Now in Ghana, you could just buy potato flour and just make fufu on the stove. But we\u2019re losing that, right? That communal experience of cutting the yam and cutting the plantain and cooking it."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Abena\u2019s grandparents made fufu the traditional way, using ingredients like yam and green bananas called plantains. These were placed in a mortar and pestle - cooking equipment made of a bowl - the mortar - and a heavy stone - the pestle - which is used to grind ingredients together."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The traditional method was to pound fufu \u2013 to crush it into a paste or powder. But nowadays many people buy ready-made flour and cook fufu the modern way, on a stove."},{"author":"Rob","text":"For Abena, this represented an unwelcome departure from ancestral ways of cooking, and she decided that something had to be done. Here\u2019s Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service\u2019s, The Food Chain, to continue the story:"},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"Abena was so taken aback about the loss of know-how about Ghana\u2019s traditional recipes and ingredients in the towns and cities, that she decided she had to do something, and set off to rural areas on a fact-finding tour."},{"author":"Abena Offeh-Gyimah","text":"We travelled across the Accra East region in Ghana, just to document indigenous dishes, and to ask \u2018what are people eating now?\u2019, and learning that a lot of dishes are lost."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Abena was taken aback by the changes in Ghana\u2019s food culture \u2013 she felt shocked and surprised. Traditionally, recipes were passed down orally from mother to daughter, instead of being written down, so a generation of young Ghanaians were losing cooking know-how \u2013 the practical skills and knowledge of how to do something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Abena travelled around Ghana to document traditional recipes \u2013 to record information about them by writing them down, or taking photos, before they were lost forever."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If her story has inspired you to find out about your own country\u2019s traditional recipes, or discover more about Ghanaian cooking, you can read more on Abena\u2019s website, Living the Ancestral Way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And after all this talk of traditional Ghanaian food, it\u2019s time for your question about a traditional British recipe, bangers and mash \u2013 or sausage and mashed potato. Now, you asked about the name \u2018banger\u2019, and I guessed that \u2018bang\u2019 was an old-fashioned word for pork. So, was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"You were\u2026 wrong, I\u2019m afraid, Rob. The name \u2018banger\u2019 started in World War One, when meat shortages resulted in sausages being made using water, that caused them to explode, going \u2018bang!\u2019, when cooked."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, that\u2019s certainly one way to spice up your cooking!
