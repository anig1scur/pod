This is 6 Minute English I'm Catherine."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I'm Sam."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Now Sam, have you been watching the World Cup?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Cricket or football? Because they are both being played at the moment"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"They are. Now I\u2019m talking about football, the Women\u2019s World Cup."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In that case, yes, I have. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it and it\u2019s been great that finally we can watch the matches live on TV and that there has been so much interest in the media."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"We\u2019ll be finding out a little bit more about the history of women\u2019s football in England in today\u2019s programme, but first, Sam, a question for you. When was the first official woman\u2019s football World Cup?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well I think I can get this through mathematics rather than knowledge, so I\u2019m not going to say it right now, but I\u2019ll tell you later."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK. Well I will tell you the answer later in the programme. Now, Gemma Clarke is a writer on women\u2019s football in England and she spoke recently on the BBC Woman\u2019s Hour Programme. Here she describes the reaction throughout the years to women\u2019s football. Has it been easy for the women\u2019s game in England?"},{"author":"Gemma Clarke","text":"Women\u2019s football has really been a struggle to play, to have any kind of agency and to be taken seriously as athletes. That can be seen throughout history. I think every moment that women\u2019s football has had, you know there\u2019s been a kind of, a backlash afterwards or a kind of an attempt to keep women back and to dampen enthusiasm for the sport."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So, it\u2019s not been easy, has it?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"No, she said it\u2019s been a struggle , which means it\u2019s been difficult to make any progress."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And she also mentioned that there was no agency in the women\u2019s game. To have agency means you have control over your own situation, you can make the decisions you want to make. So she\u2019s saying that the women\u2019s game didn\u2019t really have control over its own future."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Every time they had some success, there was a backlash , there was a negative reaction to their success."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That\u2019s right and she goes on to say that people tried to dampen enthusiasm for the sport. They tried to make it difficult for people to see and enjoy it. So who tried to dampen enthusiasm and how did they do it? Well, during and after the First World War, women\u2019s football became really popular with crowds of up to 50,000 watching games. It may have been popular with the crowds, but it wasn\u2019t so popular with the men who ran the game, the English Football Association. Here\u2019s Gemma Clarke again."},{"author":"Gemma Clarke","text":"The men\u2019s football association were panicked by seeing women doing so well and they banned all women from playing football on association grounds and that lasted for about 50 years. It was a very concerted effort to keep women\u2019s football at amateur status and ensure that there weren\u2019t crowds watching them play."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"So the men were really worried by the success of the women\u2019s game. They thought that it might take money and supporters away from the men\u2019s game."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So they banned woman from playing on their pitches. This means that they no longer allowed them to use the pitches anymore. This effectively killed the professional women\u2019s game as up to then they had been using the same facilities as the men."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"This she says was a concerted effort to restrict women\u2019s football. When you make a concerted effort to do something it means that you try really hard to do it. I\u2019m pleased to say that the ban on woman using Football Association pitches was eventually lifted, although only comparatively recently, in 1971. Right, before we review today\u2019s vocabulary, let\u2019s have the answer to today\u2019s question. So I asked you, Sam, when was the first official Women\u2019s World Cup? Was it\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I did! So, I know the World Cup is held every four years, it\u2019s 2019 now, so the answer must be an odd year \u2013 bear with me - which makes it 1991. Am I right, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well we\u2019ll see if that mathematical approach is any better than actually just knowing the answer. The first World Cup for women was actually held in \u2026.."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Come on, hurry up! Let me out of my misery."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"1970"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I can\u2019t believe I got that wrong"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"But, it wasn\u2019t an official tournament. The first official women\u2019s world cup was indeed 1991. Your maths worked. So well done Sam and everybody else who got that right. Now, before we get to extra time and penalties, let\u2019s recap today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A struggle is how you can describe something that is very difficult to achieve, something you have to fight for."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"To have agency means being able to act independently and have control over your own choices."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A backlash is a strong negative reaction to something."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"If you try to dampen enthusiasm for something, you try to make people less interested in it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Banning something means using certain powers to stop something from happening."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And finally, making a concerted effort means trying really hard."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well the final whistle has blown for us today. We\u2019ll see you again soon and don\u2019t forget to look out for more from the BBC Learning English team online, on social media and on our app. Bye for now."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Catherine","Sam","Gemma
