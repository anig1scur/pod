This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Neil, would you describe yourself as \u2018 a numbers person\u2019 ?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you mean, am I someone who understands numbers and is good as using them and interpreting data, then no!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK. So, maybe like me, you weren\u2019t good at maths at school?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, I wasn\u2019t. Algebra, geometry, times tables \u2013 it was all very confusing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019re not alone, Neil. But the fear of numbers might just be in our heads and we might have enough number knowledge to get by with. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be exploring in this programme while looking at some relevant vocabulary. But, sorry, Neil, I\u2019m going to start with a maths question! It\u2019s thought the largest number in the world is called a googol. It\u2019s written with a 1 and how many zeros? Is it\u2026 a)    A hundred zeros b)    A thousand zeros, or c)    Ten thousand zeros?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019ll guess ten thousand zeros."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later on. But let\u2019s talk more about the fear of numbers now. Of course, numbers are important in our lives but one bad experience at school can put us off them for life. \u2018 Put off\u2019 means make someone dislike something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What put me off maths was it was not only complicated but very theoretical \u2013 and not very practical \u2013 useful for real-life situations. And the problem now is, it\u2019s easy to be fooled by fancy figures that we get told about."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This is something The Why Factor programme on BBC World Service has been exploring. They spoke to Charles Seife, who\u2019s an author and professor at New York University, who explained why we are at the mercy of people who throw numbers at us\u2026."},{"author":"Charles Seife, author and professor, New York University","text":"Because we are primed not to question numbers, certain people have learned that numbers are perhaps the most powerful tools for deception... advertisers, marketers, politicians, who try to convince the public through spurious oratory - have learned that the one thing they can't get challenged on is numbers or challenges are ineffective."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Interesting words from Charles Seife there. He explains that numbers might be a powerful tool for deceiving people. Many of us are primed \u2013 so, told to behave in a certain situation and in a certain way \u2013 not to question numbers, accept them as fact."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, and this is dangerous. So, when politicians, for example, do good and effective public speaking \u2013 known as oratory \u2013 the information they give could be spurious \u2013 that means false, not correct or inaccurate. But numbers are more persuasive \u2013 they make you believe something is true."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, unless you\u2019re confident with numbers, you\u2019re unlikely to challenge the facts and figures that you are given. So, Sam, if I said to you ten per cent of the ten million people who eat meat have a twenty per cent chance of being five per cent overweight \u2013 would you challenge that?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019d have to go away and work that out! As I said, Neil, I\u2019m not a numbers person. Even talking about numbers makes me anxious."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, interestingly, The Why Factor programme explained that girls are more anxious about learning maths, but even if they feel more nervous about maths, they aren\u2019t any worse with numbers than their more confident classmates. It\u2019s just the fear that\u2019s stopping you!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well maybe, but one bad experience can knock our confidence and ability to use maths."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Take comfort from Paula Miles, who teaches statistics to psychology students at St. Andrews University. She told The Why Factor that she thinks there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018a numbers person\u2019\u2026."},{"author":"Paula Miles, St Andrews University","text":"There is no such thing as someone who is a 'number person' or not. If we're taught in the right way, then I think we all have the potential to be a numbers person. I'm not saying we're all going to grow up to be mathematicians but we're all going to get to a point where we have the basic numeracy skills that we need to be able to cope in our environment..."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I feel a little better now! We all have the possibility within us \u2013 or potential \u2013 to be a numbers person."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I think it\u2019s about survival.  We want to develop numeracy \u2013 basic mathematical skills \u2013 to use numbers in a particular situation that we are in. We might not be a genius like Einstein, but we know enough to work things out."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I wonder if you worked out the answer to my question correctly, Neil? Earlier, I asked about what\u2019s thought to be the largest number in the world - called a googol. How many zeros does it have? A hundred zeros, a thousand zeros, or ten thousand zeros?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said ten thousand zeros."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Sorry, Neil. A googol is ten to the 100"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using that number anytime soon. But I might be using some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed today, including a numbers person \u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2026 that\u2019s someone who understands numbers and is good as using them and interpreting data \u2013 not like us!"},{"author":"put","text":"If you are  off by something, it means you are made to dislike something. And to be primed means told to behave in a certain situation."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The skill of effective public speaking is known as oratory . And spurious means false, inaccurate, or not correct."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And when we have the possibility within us to do something, we describe it as our potential. And having numeracy means having basic mathematical skills."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But now we\u2019ve reached the number six \u2013 six minutes of English. Thanks very much for listening and goodbye."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye."}],"authors":["Sam","Neil","Charles Seife, author and professor, New York University","Paula Miles, St Andrews
