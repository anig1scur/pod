Working as a US park ranger, Roy was struck by lightning on seven different occasions, and survived them all!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"But Roy isn't the only victim of an unpredictable natural event, sometimes called an act of God . In the last decade, an estimated half a million people have died globally in natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and cyclones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In 2023, at least 60,000 people died after earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, and things are predicted to get worse in the future due to climate change and increasing populations. So can anything be done to stop natural disasters? Or, like Roy Sullivan, should we accept that some things are beyond our control?  In this programme we'll be finding out, and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Throughout history, floods, when there's too much water, and droughts, when there isn't enough, have caused most human deaths. But with climate change, new dangers are emerging. But do you know, Neil, which natural disaster is most responsible for human deaths now?

Probably earthquakes."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Now, in her job as Professor of Hazard and Risk at Durham University, Lucy Easthope attends conferences to advise on planning for natural emergencies.

The \u2018natural\u2019 implies a sense of fatalism and a sense of \u2018let's give up now\u2019 whereas in fact, these events \u2026 there's huge elements that we have in our grasp to both prevent, and more importantly perhaps prevent additional harm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Easthope thinks calling disasters \u2018natural\u2019 is fatalistic - it involves the belief that people are powerless to change events."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Although no-one can prevent an earthquake, there are ways people can reduce the damage done, what Professor Easthope calls  \u2018additional harm\u2019. Often this additional harm, things like the spread of diseases or destroyed roads and buildings, are worse than the disaster itself. Fortunately, ways to limit the damage are within our grasp . If something is within your grasp it is very likely that you will achieve it."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bangladesh has seen a hundred fold decrease in cyclone deaths since the introduction of its new monitoring and alert system.

So in addition to having people on bicycles with megaphones going out and saying, \u2018Look a cyclone is coming, please get to shelter!\u2019, people in the danger zones have grown up accepting that their shelters will be safe, knowing where the evacuation routes are, but most importantly that they can return afterwards to their homes and to their livelihoods because they've built the infrastructure, and they've built their jobs in order to avoid being destroyed by the cyclone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One low tech solution involves people on bicycles shouting warnings about approaching cyclones into a megaphone \u2013 a handheld cone-shaped device that makes your voice louder when you speak into it. Once people know the danger, they can start the evacuation - moving people from a dangerous place to somewhere safe."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The Bangladeshis have built shelters which protect everyone - children, the old and sick, even animals - so that when the cyclone is over they can safely return to their livelihoods -  their work, job, and other activities which give them the things they need to live."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, It's great to see people working together to survive cyclones, earlier we were talking about other natural disasters."},{"author":"Beth","text":"We were, and I asked you which disaster you thought caused most deaths and you said you thought maybe earthquakes, which was the right answer, which is why these new ideas to save  lives are so hopeful.
