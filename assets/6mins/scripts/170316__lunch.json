I'm Dan\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil. In this programme we\u2019ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch \u2013 and what our lunch choices say about us . So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ah Neil, are you asking me to join you? I\u2019d love to, thanks. There\u2019s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, actually \u2013 I was just asking to\u2026 open up today\u2019s topic. Sorry. You see, I\u2019ve brought a sandwich."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you\u2019re not the only one \u2013 a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch \u2013 every day! And yes, it\u2019s mostly sandwiches."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I had a curry yesterday."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, it\u2019s almost lunchtime so we\u2019d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I\u2019m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right\u2026 just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Peckish is a great word isn\u2019t it \u2013 it\u2019s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn\u2019t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Bee Wilson, Author They were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of makeshift lunch when you couldn\u2019t get anything better."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So \u2013 sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals. Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality \u2013 a solution you create when you can\u2019t do anything better."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I can\u2019t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"There\u2019s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich \u2013 like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there\u2019s no excuse."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you worked as hard as I did, Dan \u2013 you\u2019d only have time for a sandwich!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Which is just what Bee Wilson was saying \u2013 we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let\u2019s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And let\u2019s teach one more word first \u2013 utilitarian . It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Julian Baggini, Philosopher What lunch says about us is that we\u2019re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, utilitarian attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything, we haven\u2019t managed to make that an everyday thing \u2013 it remains something for the special occasions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So \u2013 he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient \u2013 where we have a functional, utilitarian attitude to life."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly, we\u2019re aware of a great food culture, we embrace this culture \u2013 but only for special occasions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 let\u2019s look at that word embrace . It normally means this\u2026 let me just\u2026"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh Neil, I didn\u2019t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, embraced me."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Just as we can embrace physical things and people \u2013 we can also embrace ideas."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Here\u2019s an idea I embrace , Neil. We should all embrace new foods. Broaden our horizons ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To broaden our horizons means 'to open our minds and experience new things'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Let me broaden your horizons right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better team spirit if colleagues eat together."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of team spirit \u2013 that is \u2013 getting on well with team members \u2013 having a feeling of belonging."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Finally. Vietnamese?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today\u2019s question. How long do Brits take for lunch?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits."},{"author":"Neil","text":"25 minutes? It\u2019s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let\u2019s run over the vocab one more time."},{"author":"Dan","text":"First up we had peckish . It means 'hungry \u2013 just a little hungry'. I\u2019m feeling rather peckish at the moment, you?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think I\u2019ve gone beyond peckish , Dan. Roll on lunch. Next?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"We had makeshift \u2013 which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team\u2019s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a makeshift goalie."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or, another example \u2013 when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a makeshift drum."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word utilitarian ? In the context we used it, it means 'simple and functional, rather than beautiful'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as utilitarian ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I prefer classic and timeless. Please."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh, are you going to hug me again? To embrace me?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not this time, let\u2019s stick with the metaphorical meaning \u2013 'to accept a new belief or idea'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"For example, I wasn\u2019t sure about the new website design, but now I fully embrace it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Very nice. And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together."},{"author":"Dan","text":"It looks like you\u2019ve broadened your horizons ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons and taught me about new ways of life. How about you?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, they say travel broadens the mind \u2013 it certainly broadened my horizons too."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even better \u2013 why don\u2019t we go travelling together \u2013 with the whole Learning English team?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yeah! That would be wonderful for team spirit \u2013the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It certainly would. And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon, after our delicious lunch!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And we are on social media too.
