Planners wanted to protect pedestrians from cars and to reduce pollution in its old and narrow streets. That was 50 years ago. There\u2019s a fresh interest in keeping cars out of cities now for the same reasons.

A pedestrian is someone who walks around rather than travelling by car or bus. But in Rob\u2019s sentence he used the adjective, and in this context it means dull or uninteresting!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And of course I was making a pun, Neil. Because of course the show is going to be extremely interesting! It\u2019sabout safety on the streets \u2013 and whether pedestrianisation is a good thing or not."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Pedestrianisation means changing a street into an area that can only be used by pedestrians."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it sounds like a good idea \u2013 no traffic, less noise and air pollution. And no chance of getting knocked down by a car or a bus!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"There are plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street, which is one of the busiest shopping streets in London."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s right. The Mayor of London wants to tackle \u2013 or make an effort to deal with \u2013 air pollution in this very busy spot \u2013 where the amount of traffic is definitely a problem! In fact, can you tell me, Neil, what\u2019s the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street? Is it: a) 4.6 miles per hour, b) 14.6 miles per hour or c) 46 miles per hour?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I think it\u2019s 14.6 miles per hour \u2013 a) sounds too slow and c) sounds too fast!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, we'll find out the answer later on. The problem is \u2013 the traffic doesn\u2019t just disappear. You ban it from one area \u2013 and it gets rerouted somewhere else."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ban means to say officially that something can\u2019t be done. And reroute means to change the direction you\u2019re travelling in, in order to reach a particular destination. That\u2019s true, Rob. It must be a big headache for city planners."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, let\u2019s listen now to Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets. He\u2019s going to talk some more about why traffic is causing problems in our towns and cities."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets In 1970 we had 20 million cars in this country. Now we have over 30 million cars in such a short period. So that creates three big problems. One is space \u2013 because we\u2019ve still got the same street structures in our towns and cities, causing congestion. It causes pollution, which people are concerned about more and more. And actually, it\u2019s kind of engineering walking out of our lives. So we\u2019re actually not getting enough exercise, which is a cause of a health crisis. Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation \u2013 in Glasgow, in Birmingham, in London for example, Manchester \u2013 as a way of not only making their places, cities better and more attractive, actually, building their local economy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Neil Urvin identifies three problems \u2013 the first is that our city streets have stayed the same while the number of cars on the roads has increased dramatically."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s right \u2013 and this has led to congestion on our roads. Congestion means too much traffic, making it hard to move."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The second problem is pollution \u2013 which we mentioned earlier."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Pollution is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the third problem is that by travelling around on buses or in our cars we aren\u2019t getting enough exercise. And we all know that\u2019s a bad thing! Would pedestrianisation engineer walking back into our lives do you think?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019m not sure, Neil. It would be great if we could go shopping or walk to work without breathing in fumes or worrying about getting knocked down by a car. But banning all motorised traffic from town centres might make life difficult for people to get around."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019m not a town planner \u2013 and I don\u2019t have the answers. But I would like to know if I got the answer right to the question you asked me earlier!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well I asked you: What\u2019s the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street? Is it\u2026 a) 4.6mph, b) 14.6mph or c) 46mph?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said 14.6mph."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And that\u2019s not slow enough, Neil, I\u2019m afraid. The answer is actually 4.6mph. And we pedestrians walk at an average speed of 3.1mph apparently!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good to know. OK \u2013 shall we go over the words we learned today, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Sure \u2013 the first one is \u2018pedestrian\u2019 \u2013 a person who is walking, usually in an area where there\u2019s traffic. \u2018Sorry \u2013 you can\u2019t ride your bike here. This path is for pedestrians only.\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective \u2013 \u2018This book is full of very pedestrian ideas. I wouldn\u2019t read it if I were you.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019ve crossed it off my list, Neil. Thank you. OK \u2013 number two is 'to tackle' something, which means to make an effort to deal with a difficult problem. For example, \u2018The government isn\u2019t really tackling the problem of air pollution. It needs to do much more.\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Very true. OK, \u2018ban\u2019 means to officially say that something can\u2019t be done. \u2018The UK government will ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars from 2040.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And number four is \u2018reroute\u2019 which means to change the direction you\u2019re travelling in."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018The council has rerouted all buses to avoid the town centre.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"\u2018Congestion\u2019 is number five \u2013 too much traffic, making it difficult to move."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Road congestion always gets better in the summer when a lot of car drivers are on holiday.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? London always seems emptier in July and August."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Except for all the tourists walking around \u2013 congesting the streets!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Very funny! And finally, number six is \u2018pollution\u2019 \u2013 which is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air, or plastic into the sea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018You can help reduce air pollution by walking to work every day instead of driving.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Are you talking to me, Neil? I always walk to work!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I know you do, Rob \u2013 you\u2019re an example to us all!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, that\u2019s all we have time for today."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But please don\u2019t forget to visit us via our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages!
