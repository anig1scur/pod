It's not your kind of book. You wouldn't like it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"How do you know?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well, I just think you might read something a little more intellectual."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh I see\u2026 Well we are talking about the kinds of books people read and what they say about them today."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Yes. Perhaps you read the works of a famous writer \u2013 the classics \u2013 Charles Dickens, Shakespeare."},{"author":"Neil","text":"People will think you are an intellectual. You can show off by reading these books \u2013 the classics."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Or perhaps you read popular novels or romantic fiction \u2013 a light easy read."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When you go on holiday \u2013 maybe to the beach \u2013 what kind of books do you read? And what do you read when you're going to work?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"We're going to hear part of a BBC interview with David Adshead from the Commuter Book Club.

Are you ready?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Yes, absolutely."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. It's about classic book sales. So these days are people buying\u2026"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Oh that's an interesting one. Tricky to guess but I'm going to say c) fewer classic books."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well, let\u2019s find out the answer at the end of the programme. But now, here is David Adshead from the Commuter Club. What kind of book does he say people usually take with them to the beach?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"David Adshead, Commuter Book Club People often think that, you know, traditionally you take a light easy read for the beach and on the train, um, you maybe read something very different."},{"author":"Interviewer","text":"\u2026 if only to show off."},{"author":"David Adshead","text":"Exactly, to appear to others to be more intellectual. But actually, what we find in this is that it really comes down to the individual \u2013 what they like to read and actually we've seen this summer a lot of the book sales - summer reads is generally lighter books, easier to get on with, to take away on holiday - but the big retailers have seen a shift actually - people moving sort of slightly higher brow, taking away more classic books. Sales in that way have increased."},{"author":"Neil","text":"David Adshead from the Commuter Book Club there. He says that people usually \u2013 traditionally - take a light, easy read to the beach or on the train."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Yes. He says these books are easier to get on with. David says that it really comes down to the individual - each person is different. But he says that there has been a shift \u2013 a change \u2013 in what people read."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, he says that the shops that sell books \u2013 that's the retailers \u2013 say the books people are buying are more highbrow \u2013 the classics, as we were talking about."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Absolutely. Highbrow books are read by intellectuals or perhaps the people who read these books are just showing off."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, maybe they are. Well I wonder if these people have read any books by Fiona Harper. She writes romantic novels \u2013 that's stories about love."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Light reading \u2013 not highbrow. She was also at this interview about the Commuter Book Club."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, do commuters read her romantic novels on the Tube?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well here is novelist Fiona Harper talking about how she writes her romantic novels. She wants people to not stop reading her stories once they start \u2013 she wants them to be hooked."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Author Fiona Harper I think what it comes down to most of the time is you just want to write a really good story because if you write a good story then hopefully people are hooked, they'll keep turning the pages and.."},{"author":"Interviewer","text":"And do you wonder whether they are reading them on holiday? I mean presumably, they're more likely to read your stuff on holiday than when they\u2019re sitting on the Tube being looked at by lots of other people. I don't know. Author Fiona Harper Possibly, although with the advent of e-readers, you can read anything you like and no one knows \u2013 or on your phone \u2013 no one knows what you're reading. Interviewer And that's an important point."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That's the author Fiona Harper talking about romantic novels. So do commuters read her books on the Tube?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well perhaps you don't want others to see you reading that stuff. It can be a bit embarrassing. It shouldn't be, but Fiona says you can also use an e-reader."},{"author":"Neil","text":"An e-reader \u2013 that's an electronic book. Instead of pages, you read off a screen."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well if you use an e-reader or tablet, no one knows what you're reading."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So perhaps they are reading a romantic novel \u2013 no one knows. OK. Let's take a moment to look at some of today's words."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Here they are:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And before we go, the answer to today's quiz question. I asked about classic books. Are people these days buying\u2026"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Yes.

They're reading more classic books!"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Oh excellent!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sales of these books are apparently increasing."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well that's good to hear."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
