No headache or sore throat?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"No, I feel fine thanks, Neil. Why do you ask?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019ve been reading some inspirational stories about the doctors and nurses fighting Covid. When I was a boy, I always dreamed of becoming a doctor."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah, I see. Have you ever been in hospital?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I have, and I remember the nurse\u2019s bedside manner \u2013 you know, the kind and caring way that doctors and nurses treat people who are ill."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Nowadays more and more of the jobs that humans do are being carried out by machines. But I doubt that a doctor\u2019s bedside manner could easily be replaced by a robot."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be discussing whether the revolution in artificial intelligence, often shortened to \u2018AI\u2019, could replace human doctors and nurses. We\u2019ll be asking: can you imagine a future without doctors?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"In fact, machines are already doing some of the jobs traditionally done by doctors - scanning people\u2019s bodies to detect skin cancer, for example."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, that\u2019s true, Sam, and it links to my quiz question which is about human skin. It\u2019s a well-known fact that skin is the human body\u2019s largest organ \u2013 but how much skin does the average adult have? Is it: a) 2 square metres?, b) 3 square metres? or, c) 4 square metres?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course our skin gets loose as we age but I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s 3 square metres of it! I\u2019ll say the answer is a) 2 square metres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s correct later. Every year in the UK over 5 million people are treated for skin cancer. Catch it early and your chances of survival are increased."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Usually a skin specialist, or dermatologist, will examine your skin using a handheld microscope. But in 2017, a team of researchers at Stanford Medical School made an exciting announcement."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here\u2019s Oxford University researcher Daniel Susskind, telling BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea, what the medics at Stanford had invented:"},{"author":"Daniel Susskind","text":"A team of researchers at Stamford last year announced the development of a system that, if you give it a photo of a freckle it can tell you as accurately as twenty-one leading dermatologists whether or not that freckle is cancerous ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The Stanford medical team had invented an AI system to analyse freckles \u2013 small brown spots found on people\u2019s skin, especially on pale skin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As it turned out the AI programme was better than human doctors at telling whether a freckle was harmless or cancerous \u2013 connected to some type of cancer."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, it seems that artificial intelligence is already replacing humans when it comes to detecting cancer \u2013 and doing a better job of it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But Daniel Susskind isn\u2019t convinced. One reason is that AI systems still need humans to programme them \u2013 and as it turns out, knowing exactly how doctors detect illness remains something of a mystery."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s Daniel Susskind again in conversation with BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea:"},{"author":"Daniel Susskind","text":"If you ask a doctor how it is they make a diagnosis , they might be able to point you to particularly revealing parts of a reference book or give you a few rules of thumb , but ultimately they\u2019d struggle\u2026 they\u2019d say again it requires things like creativity and judgment, and these things are very difficult to articulate \u2013 and so traditionally it\u2019s been thought very hard to automate \u2013 if a human being can\u2019t explain how they do these special things, where on earth do we begin in writing instructions for a machine to follow?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Most doctors find it difficult to explain how they make a diagnosis \u2013 their judgement about what someone\u2019s particular sickness is, made by examining them."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Diagnosing someone\u2019s illness is complicated but there are some rules of thumb . A rule of thumb is a practical but approximate way of doing something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For example, when cooking, a good rule of thumb is two portions of water to one portion of rice."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Exactly. And because identifying sickness is so difficult, Daniel says \u201c where on earth do we begin writing instructions for a machine?\u201d We use phrases like where, how or what on earth to show feelings like anger, surprise or disbelief."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I might show surprise by asking Sam, \u2018 how on earth did you know the answer to that ?\u2019"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ha ha! I guess you\u2019re talking about your quiz question, Neil? And you needn\u2019t be so surprised \u2013 I\u2019m naturally brainy!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Neil Of course you are. In my quiz question I asked Sam how much skin there is on an adult human body."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said it was a) 2 square metres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! With your brains I think you\u2019d make a good doctor, Sam, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have a good bedside manner too."},{"author":"Sam","text":"You mean, the kind and caring way that doctors and nurses treat their patients. OK, let\u2019s recap the rest of the vocabulary, starting with freckle \u2013 a small brown spot on someone\u2019s skin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Freckles are usually harmless, but some skin spots can be cancerous \u2013 connected to cancer."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A doctor\u2019s diagnosis is their judgement about what someone\u2019s particular sickness or disease is."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A rule of thumb is a useful but approximate way of doing or measuring something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, we use phrases like where on earth..? as a way to show emotions like anger, surprise or disbelief."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme but join us for the next edition of 6 Minute English when we\u2019ll discuss another trending topic and the related vocabulary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Why on earth would you miss it?
