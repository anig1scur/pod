I mean, men and women\u2019s bodies are different."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right, and it takes both - a man and a woman - to make a baby."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s true - in humans anyway.

But amazingly, the female of some species can do it all by herself!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before that, it\u2019s time for my quiz question. In Britain\u2019s Chester Zoo in 2006, \u2018Flora\u2019 laid eleven eggs that developed into healthy babies. Her zookeepers were mystified because Flora had only been kept with other females and had never been near a male. But what type of animal was Flora? Was she: a) a python?, b) a zebra shark?,  or c) a Komodo dragon?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hmm, pythons are pretty unusual creatures so I\u2019ll say Flora was a python."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Rob, we\u2019ll find out later if you\u2019re right. Actually, it\u2019s not only reptiles who behave this way \u2013 the females of many animal species are able to reproduce without sex."},{"author":"Rob","text":"By doing this they gain several advantages: they can rapidly spread, colonise and control large areas and they don\u2019t waste time and energy looking for a mate."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But if a world without sex is so much better, why bother with males at all?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Good question, Neil, and one which BBC World Service programme, Discovery, asked evolutionary biologist, Chris Wilson:"},{"author":"Chris Wilson","text":"Well absolutely! And there are other advantages I mean, if you\u2019re an all-female population you don\u2019t have to waste time searching and competing for mates , there are no more sexually-transmitted diseases and so it seems like the easiest decision \u2013 and yet, less than one percent of all animal species are completely celibate \u2013 and that\u2019s a huge fundamental puzzle in evolutionary biology that we\u2019re still not entirely sure we understand \u2013 it\u2019s called sometimes the paradox of sex."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Despite the advantages of going without sex, in reality fewer than one percent of all animals are celibate \u2013 live without having sex."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This begs the question, why is sex so common when it seems so inefficient? Chris calls this the paradox of sex. A paradox is a situation which seems contradictory because it contains two opposite facts, for example, the existence of males if we can reproduce without them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As a male myself, I have to say I\u2019m feeling a little underappreciated right now, Rob!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well don\u2019t worry, Neil, because it turns out there might be a use for males after all! It seems the sex paradox has been solved by one of nature\u2019s most ingenious insects - aphids."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here\u2019s ecologist, Amber Wright, explaining how to the BBC World Service\u2019s Discovery programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"See if you can hear the strategy American aphids use to reproduce."},{"author":"Amber Wright","text":"The aphids we have in the US \u2013 when spring comes around, the eggs hatch and they\u2019ll be all female for several generations, and then at the end of the summer they will hatch out males and females and mate, and then create eggs that wait for next year \u2013 kind of the best of both worlds."},{"author":"Presenter Lucy Cooke","text":"Hedging their bets basically \u2013 using cloning to rapidly colonise and then using sex to mix up the genes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the spring, female aphids lay eggs which hatch \u2013 break open allowing the young to come out. The young aphids that hatch are all female."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But later, at the end of summer, both female and male aphids hatch out and start to reproduce by mating. So the aphids have the best of best of both worlds \u2013 they enjoy the advantages of very different things at the same time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or to put it another way, the aphids hedge their bets \u2013 they follow two courses of action instead of choosing between them. By cloning themselves with \u2018virgin births\u2019 and reproducing sexually, aphids maximise their chances of survival."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Gardeners around the world will be upset to hear that \u2013 those young aphids just love eating tomato plants!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"But on the plus side, it seems being male can be useful after all."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But not if you\u2019re Flora, the female you asked about in your quiz question. So, what type of animal was she?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right \u2013 I asked whether the-virgin-Flora was a) a python, b) a shark or c) a Komodo dragon."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I guessed a) a python."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Rob, you\u2019re right that some female pythons can reproduce by themselves \u2013 and sharks too \u2013 but the correct answer is that Flora was, c) a Komodo dragon."},{"author":"mate","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary, starting with  - an animal\u2019s sexual partner; something you don\u2019t have if you\u2019re celibate \u2013 living without sex."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Animal eggs hatch \u2013 or break open to let the young out."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And a paradox is a situation which seems contradictory because it contains two opposite facts."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Species which reproduce parthenogenetically and sexually have the best of both worlds - enjoy the advantages of very different things at the same time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And if you hedge your bets , you follow two courses of action instead of choosing between them so you don\u2019t miss out."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, that\u2019s all there\u2019s time for.
