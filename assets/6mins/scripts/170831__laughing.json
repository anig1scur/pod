I'm Neil\u2026 and those guffaws you can hear are coming from Tim. So what's so funny, Tim?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Can you pass me a glass of water?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, OK, here you go."},{"author":"Tim","text":"It was just something our producer said before I came into the studio. A guffaw by the way is a loud laugh that you can't control..."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So while Tim laughs his head off \u2013 and that means to laugh very loudly for a long time \u2013 I'll introduce the show. Today, Tim, we're talking about laughter and how it could kill you\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Oh come on, Neil! That's not funny! Laughing is good for you \u2013 everyone knows that!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, not when you laugh like that, Tim! You're bright red in the face, you've got tears streaming down your face. And you nearly choked on a glass of water! Choke means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat by the way. Now, without laughing or choking, can you please tell me how many times a day the average adult laughs? Is it\u2026 a) 17, b) 70 or c) 700?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Hmm. Surely it depends on what type of person you are?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe it does. That's why I'm asking about the average number of times Tim, so just make an intelligent guess. Tim OK, well I laugh a lot so I'm going to say 70 times a day. 700 times seems like you'd be laughing all the time\u2026 But you've worried, me Neil \u2013 I know we sometimes say, I nearly died laughing \u2013 but nobody does actually die laughing, do they?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I think the risk of dying of laughter is probably low \u2013 but in theory, what happens when we laugh is potentially dangerous! Let's listen to cognitive neuroscientist Sophie Scott talking about what happens when we laugh."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Sophie Scott, cognitive neuroscientist Laughter \u2013 in a competition for control over your ribcage in your brain between laughter and breathing and speaking \u2013 laughter will always win. And laughter just takes those same muscles and it squeezes them \u2013 eh eh eh eh \u2013 and the air goes \u2013 out out out out \u2013 and notably it does not want to let you breathe in. It's trying to kill you. It's quite dangerous."},{"author":"Tim","text":"So when you laugh a lot your diaphragm \u2013 that's the sheet of muscle below your lungs \u2013 contracts and squeezes the air out of your lungs."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This makes it hard to breathe \u2013 which is why you were gasping for breath earlier, Tim! And that's why laughter can kill you!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Gasping means having difficulty breathing. Well, I've caught my breath now \u2013 I didn't die \u2013 and I think it's fair to say, Neil, that laughter is good for you. When you laugh, your body releases happy hormones\u2026 And according to some research, people feel less pain as a result of having a good laugh."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So scientists are saying laughter is a sort of natural painkiller?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Apparently, yes. They've done research where they make people laugh, and then test their pain levels afterwards. And they found that if people only chuckle a bit it doesn't act as a painkiller, but if you laugh a lot, it does."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So a chuckle sounds like this [chuckles]. Chuckling means to laugh quietly. So you need belly laughter then \u2013 great big guffaws? Tim That's right. A guffaw is pretty much the opposite of a chuckle. I was guffawing earlier in the show. Would you like to demonstrate your own guffaw, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"[hearty guffaw]"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Fantastic \u2013 can I try pinching you now, and test whether you feel any pain?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, you can't, Tim. It's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked you:"},{"author":"Tim","text":"I said 70\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sorry. The right answer is actually 17 \u2013 less than you thought I'm afraid, Tim. But children laugh on average 300 times a day."},{"author":"Tim","text":"That's a big difference! You see, Neil, we all need to laugh more. You shouldn't be trying to tell us that laughing is dangerous."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe you're right. So let's move on and go over the words we learned today. The first one is 'guffaw' \u2013 which is a loud laugh that you can't control..."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cNeil surprised us with his deep guffaw.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Next up \u2013 number two \u2013 to 'laugh your head off' \u2013 means to laugh very loudly for a long time."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cIt's a really funny movie \u2013 you'll laugh your head off!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK \u2013 number three \u2013 'choke' means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cI nearly choked to death on a cheese sandwich.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Poor Tim \u2013 you should eat more slowly! 'Diaphragm' is our next word, and that's the sheet of muscle separating your lungs from your stomach. We use our diaphragms for breathing, talking, and laughing!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cDo opera singers have more powerful diaphragms than other people?\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I don't know the answer to that, Tim. So number five, which is 'gasping', which means having difficulty breathing. \u201cHe was gasping for breath as he swam to the surface of the swimming pool.\u201d"},{"author":"Tim","text":"But 'gasp' also means to be shocked or surprised by something. For example, \u201cI gasped in astonishment when I heard Neil laugh.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Our final word is 'chuckle' which means to laugh quietly."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cThe audience chuckled through the show but they didn't seem very amused.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear. Well I hope our audience has been amused today. If you're looking for more laughs, then please check out our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. You may find something to make you chuckle or guffaw there."},{"author":"Tim and Neil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Tim","INSERT","Tim and
