We\u2019re discussing the following: \u2018Is it good to disagree?\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I know, but I feel better for having that little disagreement \u2013 so that proves it is good to disagree!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I hate to disagree, but I think we should explore this subject a little further first in the next six minutes\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Err, shouldn\u2019t that be five minutes?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Rob, you are being pedantic \u2013 focussing too much on the small details or formal rules. Maybe we should agree to disagree and move onto the quiz question I like to set you every week."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, a good idea."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK. So, do you know which spiritual leader is famous for saying \u201cDisagreement is something normal\u201d? Is it\u2026 a) Pope Francis b) The Dalai Lama, or c) Ravi Shankar"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s tricky so I\u2019ll have a guess and say b) the Dalai Lama."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I'll let you know if that was correct at the end of the programme. But whoever said \u2018disagreement is something normal\u2019 is probably right. I\u2019m sure we all disagree with someone about something \u2013 don\u2019t we, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"No\u2026 just joking! Of course disagreeing is normal \u2013 it would be boring if we agreed about everything. However, I guess agreement, on some things, may have prevented a few wars."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Indeed, but it is a fascinating subject and it\u2019s something the BBC Radio 4 programme \u2018A Guide to Disagreeing Better\u2019 looked at. I think we should hear about how NOT to disagree first. This is couples' therapist, author and speaker Esther Perel, who knows a thing or two about that..."},{"author":"Esther Perel, therapist","text":"In a battle, you position yourself in a hierarchy - one is on top of the other, and then there is arguing that comes with a contempt in which it's not just that I don't accept your point of view , is that, I actually really think you\u2019re a lesser human being."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right, so Esther explains that bad disagreement is a battle \u2013 one person tries to take a higher position in the hierarchy . A hierarchy is a way of organising people according to their importance."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, a disagreement doesn\u2019t go well if one person thinks they\u2019re more important than someone else. And according to Esther, things also don\u2019t go well if someone has contempt , which is a dislike or lack of respect for someone or something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And contempt in a bad disagreement can be more than just not liking somebody\u2019s point of view \u2013 their perspective on something \u2013 it could be thinking someone is a lesser human being."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ouch! That\u2019s not nice. Let\u2019s think more now about good disagreement. The BBC podcast Seriously has listed some tips for disagreeing better, including not aiming for the middle ground \u2013 another way of saying 'compromising'."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It also suggests speaking truthfully, listening intently \u2013 that means giving all your attention to what\u2019s being said - and aiming for empathy. But not feeling at the end of a disagreement that you have to agree!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I agree - and I\u2019m sure former British politician Douglas Alexander would too. He presented the programme \u2018A Guide to Disagreeing Better\u2019 and explained why he thought disagreeing is a good thing\u2026"},{"author":"Douglas Alexander","text":"A couple of decades I spent as an elected politician convinced me that disagreement is necessary if society is to progress and a society that values civility over justice and truth would simply be a recipe for stagnation . But honest conversations involve listening intently as well as speaking truthfully."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The thoughts of Douglas Alexander there, who, through his work as a politician, is convinced that disagreement is a good thing. He says we shouldn\u2019t just follow the values of civility \u2013 that means polite behaviour. It\u2019s important to challenge and question thoughts and ideas \u2013 not just be polite and accept them!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, and if we don\u2019t challenge things and search for truth and justice, he feels it would lead to stagnation \u2013 staying the same and not developing. The verb form is \u2018 to stagnate\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But, he does say that when we discuss things and disagree we must be honest, listen to the other person intently, and speak truthfully. But I would add that this should be done politely and with respect."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Sam, I\u2019ve been listening to you intently, and if I\u2019m honest, I think it\u2019s about time you gave me the answer to today\u2019s question."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We can agree on that, Rob! So, earlier I asked you if you knew which spiritual leader is famous for saying \u201cDisagreement is something normal\u201d? Is it\u2026 a) Pope Francis b) The Dalai Lama, or c) Ravi Shankar"},{"author":"","text":"And, Rob, what did you say?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said it\u2019s b) The Dalai Lama."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And you were right - well done! Now, if you\u2019ll agree, could we recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed in this programme?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Of course. First of all, I was accused of being pedantic - focussing too much on the small details or formal rules. Then we mentioned hierarchy - this is a way of organising people according to their importance."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Contempt is a dislike or lack of respect for something or someone."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A point of view describes someone\u2019s perspective on something. Your point of view might be different from my point of view ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Indeed. And we also mentioned civility , which means polite behaviour."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And stagnation means staying the same and not developing . Would you agree, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"You are right, Rob \u2013 and that brings us to the end of our discussion about disagreeing!
