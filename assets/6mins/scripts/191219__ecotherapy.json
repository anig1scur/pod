I'm Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I'm Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Georgina, what do you do to cheer yourself up?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Having a walk usually helps \u2013 especially if it\u2019s in the countryside."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, being in all the green open space can certainly help us relax and de-stress \u2013 getting back to nature can be a tonic when you\u2019re feeling down."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A tonic is something that makes you feel happier and healthier. I\u2019ll drink to that!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Me too. But connecting with the natural world is particularly beneficial to people with mental health issues such as clinical depression. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s being called \u2018ecotherapy\u2019. More on that in a moment but here\u2019s a question for you to answer, Georgina."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, Neil. Fire away."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, seeing or even hugging trees is a form of therapy, but how high is the world\u2019s tallest tree thought to be? Is it... a)      65.8 metres, b)    115.8 metres, or c)    185.8 metres Georgina, any ideas?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Not a clue \u2013 but let\u2019s go for the highest figure of 185.8 metres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Are you sure? Well, we\u2019ll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out. Now, the mental health charity, Mind, describes ecotherapy as a formal type of treatment which involves doing outdoor activities in nature. However, there\u2019s not one simple definition, it just relates to doing activities outdoors."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, it can involve doing many things, such as outdoor yoga or horticulture \u2013 another name for gardening. It doesn\u2019t involve taking medication, but instead it just develops a person\u2019s relationship with nature."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s something Patricia Hasbach knows a lot about. She\u2019s a clinical psychotherapist and told the BBC Radio programme Health Check how ecotherapy can help. Does she say it can help everyone?"},{"author":"Patricia Hasbach, clinical psychotherapist","text":"I often think about ecotherapy as another tool in the therapist's toolbox. It's not a panacea . It's not going to erase somebody's pain or grief. But it is a powerful tool, you know. Traditionally therapy has stopped at the urban boundary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So it\u2019s interesting that she describes ecotherapy as a tool \u2013 something that can be used to achieve something else. Here is can be used to help improve someone\u2019s mental health."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah, but she says it\u2019s not a panacea \u2013 so not something that will solve everything \u2013 it won\u2019t erase or get rid of someone\u2019s pain. But going beyond what she calls the \u2018urban boundary\u2019, and into the natural world, means there is another method for helping people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, as we\u2019ve mentioned, ecotherapy can take on many forms \u2013 doing art in a forest or running on a beach are all therapeutic . They're things that makes you feel better or healthier."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, I think that\u2019s clear, but what is it about the outdoors that affects us?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A good question, Georgina. It seems from research that our busy brains are always on guard, but when we get into nature it gets a break, there\u2019s not so much to be on the lookout for and we can relax."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, it does seem the negative symptoms of urban life can benefit from a dose of nature \u2013 a dose is an amount of something. Let\u2019s get a good explanation from an expert. Environmental psychologist Birgitta Gatersleben also spoke to the BBC Health Check programme and gave two reasons \u2013 one of them, she explained, was something called \u2018 biophilia\u2019."},{"author":"Birgitta Gatersleben, environmental psychologist","text":"Biophilia , very briefly, is really an innate positive response that people have with life and life-like features. The idea that nature reminds us of life, and if we (are) exposed to the natural elements then our sort of negative feelings get almost immediately replaced with positive emotions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Birgitta Gatersleben there explaining biophilia \u2013 which is a passion for or empathy with the natural world and living things."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"She said biophilia is innate , which means is a quality that you\u2019re born with. So basically, most of us were born to connect with nature \u2013 nature reminds us of life and gives us good, positive emotions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Naturally. OK. Well, Georgina, maybe getting today\u2019s quiz question right will give you positive emotions. Earlier I asked you how high the world\u2019s tallest tree is thought to be. Is it... a)      65.8 metres, b)    115.8 metres, or c)    185.8 metres What did you say?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said c) 185.8 metres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, I'm afraid that's far too high! The correct answer is 115.8 metres. Never mind. The tree, named Hyperion, is a type of redwood and was found in California in 2006."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, that\u2019s still very tall, and would be great to see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now we\u2019ve just got time to recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed, starting with tonic which can be a fizzy drink you mix with an alcoholic drink, but in the context of therapy it can mean something that makes you feel happier and healthier."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Horticulture is the study or activity of growing garden plants \u2013 in other words, gardening."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A panacea is something believed to solve everything."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"If something is therapeutic , it makes you feel better or healthier."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We also discussed biophilia , which is a passion for or empathy with the natural world and living things."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And innate means a quality that you naturally have \u2013 you\u2019re born with it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, as you know I have an innate quality for presenting this programme \u2013 but now it\u2019s time to go. Please join us next time, and don\u2019t forget to check us out on your favourite social media platform, on our app and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com.
