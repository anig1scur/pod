I'm Phil. Georgie And I'm Georgie. Now, you probably know the word 'wellbeing' \u2013 it's a general feeling of health and happiness. But have you ever heard of 'flourishing'? It's an idea which Claudia Hammond has been investigating for BBC Radio 4 programme, All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond I wonder if you all feel that you are 'flourishing' in life. This is another psychological buzzword with added evidence. Now, if you've not heard that term before, it's not just about wellbeing \u2013 it's about your whole life being good. Phil 'Flourishing' is a psychological buzzword \u2013 a word or phrase that has become fashionable and is being used a lot, especially on television and in newspapers. People who are flourishing feel good about all aspects of their life, including happiness, health, relationships and financial security. Do you feel you're flourishing, Georgie? Georgie Yeah, I think I'm quite lucky, actually. I really like my job. I have a good family and friends. Erm\u2026 yeah, everything's going well! What about you, Phil? Phil I think the same. I think I'm happy and I've got everything I need. Georgie Lovely. Phil In this episode, we'll hear about the Global Flourishing Study \u2013 a new survey into the lives of over 200,000 people in 22 countries. We'll learn some useful new words and phrases, and remember \u2013 you'll find all this episode's vocabulary on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Georgie Yes, but first, Phil, I have a question for you about the Global Flourishing Study. In terms of overall flourishing, which country do you think came out on top? Was it: a)    Indonesia, b)    Denmark, or c)    Brazil? Phil Ooh, I'm going to guess b) Denmark, I think. Georgie OK Phil. Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Now, the study investigated six areas of life, including health, finances, social relationships and religion. Let's listen as Claudia Hammond discusses some of the findings with psychologist Dr Peter Olusoga for BBC Radio 4's All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond What were the most interesting nuggets there? You've been diving into it. Dr Peter Olusoga Some of the, sort of, headlines were: high-income countries \u2013 so Sweden, the USA, for example \u2013 scored higher on some of the more material aspects of flourishing, so things like finance. Middle-income countries \u2013 so Mexico, for example \u2013 scored more highly on things like meaning of relationships and kindness and social cohesion. Phil Claudia asks about the study's most interesting nuggets . A nugget means a small piece of something good, like wisdom, or precious, like a nugget of gold. Georgie While richer countries scored higher on material happiness, middle-income countries did better in terms of kindness and social connection. There were interesting differences between men and women. For example, in Japan women flourished more than men, while in Brazil the opposite was true. And across all countries, flourishing increased after the age of 50. Phil So, does flourishing depend on your nationality, or are there things anyone can do to feel happier wherever they live? Let's find out, as Claudia Hammond talks more with Peter Olusoga for BBC Radio 4's All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond So, what can any of us do to help ourselves to flourish? That's the big question . Dr Peter Olusoga Well, there's a few things that we can do, and they are supported by research as well. So, things that are as simple as just practising gratitude , right? Being thankful for what we have is a way of increasing the amount of flourishing that we have in our lives. Showing kindness, which helps us to develop connection with other people. And just celebrating our own accomplishments \u2013 I think we've spoken on the programme before about savouring . Claudia Hammond Oh yeah, we have. Yes, savouring those good moments. Dr Peter Olusoga Exactly. Just taking the time to really appreciate some of those small wins . Georgie Claudia asks the big question \u2013 in other words, the thing everyone would like to know: how do people flourish? Phil There are simple things anyone can do, starting with gratitude \u2013 feeling thankful and appreciative for what you have. Being kind and connecting with others are also indicators of flourishing. Georgie The study also recommends savouring life. To savour means to fully enjoy something by experiencing it slowly and mindfully. It involves taking time out to enjoy good moments \u2013 to 'stop and smell the roses', as we say. Phil This links to the phrase small wins \u2013 minor achievements or successes which bring you a little closer to your long-term goals in life. There's an old saying \u2013 'a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step' \u2013 and savouring each small win along the way is vital to flourishing. Flourishing seems to be a big new idea, in some countries at least, which reminds me of your question, Georgie. Georgie Yes. Phil, I asked you, \"In the Global Flourishing Study, which country came out on top?\" And the options were Indonesia, Denmark or Brazil. Phil And I said, \"Denmark.\" Georgie \u2026which, Phil, I'm afraid that is the wrong answer. The correct answer is Indonesia. OK. Let's recap the vocabulary we've learned, starting with buzzword \u2013 a word or expression on a certain topic that has become fashionable and much used. Phil A nugget is a small piece of something good or precious, such as a nugget of gold or a nugget of wisdom. Georgie The big question is the thing everyone would like to know. Phil Gratitude means being thankful for what you have. Georgie If you savour something, you enjoy something as much as possible by experiencing it slowly. Phil And finally, small wins are minor successes which contribute to a larger life goal.

this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Phil. Georgie And I'm Georgie. Now, you probably know the word 'wellbeing' \u2013 it's a general feeling of health and happiness. But have you ever heard of 'flourishing'? It's an idea which Claudia Hammond has been investigating for BBC Radio 4 programme, All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond I wonder if you all feel that you are 'flourishing' in life. This is another psychological buzzword with added evidence. Now, if you've not heard that term before, it's not just about wellbeing \u2013 it's about your whole life being good. Phil 'Flourishing' is a psychological buzzword \u2013 a word or phrase that has become fashionable and is being used a lot, especially on television and in newspapers. People who are flourishing feel good about all aspects of their life, including happiness, health, relationships and financial security. Do you feel you're flourishing, Georgie? Georgie Yeah, I think I'm quite lucky, actually. I really like my job. I have a good family and friends. Erm\u2026 yeah, everything's going well! What about you, Phil? Phil I think the same. I think I'm happy and I've got everything I need. Georgie Lovely. Phil In this episode, we'll hear about the Global Flourishing Study \u2013 a new survey into the lives of over 200,000 people in 22 countries. We'll learn some useful new words and phrases, and remember \u2013 you'll find all this episode's vocabulary on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Georgie Yes, but first, Phil, I have a question for you about the Global Flourishing Study. In terms of overall flourishing, which country do you think came out on top? Was it: a)    Indonesia, b)    Denmark, or c)    Brazil? Phil Ooh, I'm going to guess b) Denmark, I think. Georgie OK Phil. Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Now, the study investigated six areas of life, including health, finances, social relationships and religion. Let's listen as Claudia Hammond discusses some of the findings with psychologist Dr Peter Olusoga for BBC Radio 4's All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond What were the most interesting nuggets there? You've been diving into it. Dr Peter Olusoga Some of the, sort of, headlines were: high-income countries \u2013 so Sweden, the USA, for example \u2013 scored higher on some of the more material aspects of flourishing, so things like finance. Middle-income countries \u2013 so Mexico, for example \u2013 scored more highly on things like meaning of relationships and kindness and social cohesion. Phil Claudia asks about the study's most interesting nuggets . A nugget means a small piece of something good, like wisdom, or precious, like a nugget of gold. Georgie While richer countries scored higher on material happiness, middle-income countries did better in terms of kindness and social connection. There were interesting differences between men and women. For example, in Japan women flourished more than men, while in Brazil the opposite was true. And across all countries, flourishing increased after the age of 50. Phil So, does flourishing depend on your nationality, or are there things anyone can do to feel happier wherever they live? Let's find out, as Claudia Hammond talks more with Peter Olusoga for BBC Radio 4's All in the Mind. Claudia Hammond So, what can any of us do to help ourselves to flourish? That's the big question . Dr Peter Olusoga Well, there's a few things that we can do, and they are supported by research as well. So, things that are as simple as just practising gratitude , right? Being thankful for what we have is a way of increasing the amount of flourishing that we have in our lives. Showing kindness, which helps us to develop connection with other people. And just celebrating our own accomplishments \u2013 I think we've spoken on the programme before about savouring . Claudia Hammond Oh yeah, we have. Yes, savouring those good moments. Dr Peter Olusoga Exactly. Just taking the time to really appreciate some of those small wins . Georgie Claudia asks the big question \u2013 in other words, the thing everyone would like to know: how do people flourish? Phil There are simple things anyone can do, starting with gratitude \u2013 feeling thankful and appreciative for what you have. Being kind and connecting with others are also indicators of flourishing. Georgie The study also recommends savouring life. To savour means to fully enjoy something by experiencing it slowly and mindfully. It involves taking time out to enjoy good moments \u2013 to 'stop and smell the roses', as we say. Phil This links to the phrase small wins \u2013 minor achievements or successes which bring you a little closer to your long-term goals in life. There's an old saying \u2013 'a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step' \u2013 and savouring each small win along the way is vital to flourishing. Flourishing seems to be a big new idea, in some countries at least, which reminds me of your question, Georgie. Georgie Yes. Phil, I asked you, \"In the Global Flourishing Study, which country came out on top?\" And the options were Indonesia, Denmark or Brazil. Phil And I said, \"Denmark.\" Georgie \u2026which, Phil, I'm afraid that is the wrong answer. The correct answer is Indonesia. OK. Let's recap the vocabulary we've learned, starting with buzzword \u2013 a word or expression on a certain topic that has become fashionable and much used. Phil A nugget is a small piece of something good or precious, such as a nugget of gold or a nugget of wisdom. Georgie The big question is the thing everyone would like to know.
