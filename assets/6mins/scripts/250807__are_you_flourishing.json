Middle-income countries \u2013 so Mexico, for example \u2013 scored more highly on things like meaning of relationships and kindness and social cohesion."

There were interesting differences between men and women. For example, in Japan women flourished more than men, while in Brazil the opposite was true. And across all countries, flourishing increased after the age of 50."

Being thankful for what we have is a way of increasing the amount of flourishing that we have in our lives. Showing kindness, which helps us to develop connection with other people. And just celebrating our own accomplishments \u2013 I think we've spoken on the programme before about savouring ."

There's an old saying \u2013 'a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step' \u2013 and savouring each small win along the way is vital to flourishing. Flourishing seems to be a big new idea, in some countries at least, which reminds me of your question, Georgie."
