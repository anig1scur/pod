Georgina!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Oh sorry, Neil, I didn\u2019t hear you - I was listening to music on my headphones !"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, I see! Listening to music stored on your mobile phone or iPod when out on-the-move doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal now, but the concept of personal portable music didn\u2019t exist until 1979, when the Japanese electronics company, Sony, launched the Walkman."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Years before iPods and MP3 downloads, the Sony Walkman was the first widely available portable music player. It revolutionised the way fans listened to their favourite bands."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be taking a nostalgic look back at the 1980s and the birth of the Sony Walkman."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And, of course, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, it may not seem so revolutionary to young people nowadays, but back in the late 1970s portable music players were unheard of."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The idea behind the Walkman was simple \u2013 a high-quality stereo cassette player, small enough to hold in your hand, allowing you to walk down the street listening to your own soundtrack."},{"author":"Neil","text":"They became so popular that by the time production of the Walkman ended in 2010, Sony had sold over 220 million machines worldwide. So, my quiz question is this: when the original Walkman model first went on sale in 1979, how much did it cost? Was it: a) 50 dollars?, b) 100 dollars?,  or c) 150 dollars?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Things were a lot cheaper in 1979, Neil, so I\u2019ll say b) 100 dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina \u2013 we\u2019ll find out later if that\u2019s right. Now, the inspiration behind the Walkman came from Sony chairman, Akio Morita. He saw Japanese teenagers listening to heavy transistor radios carried on their shoulders and had a vision of a smaller stereo which could be held in the hand."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"However, few of Mr Morita\u2019s colleagues had faith in his idea for a portable music player. Here\u2019s Andrea Koppen, of Sony UK, speaking to the BBC in 1989, taken from the BBC World Service programme, Witness History."},{"author":"Andrea Koppen","text":"People were very sceptical - they couldn\u2019t believe that people would want to walk around with headphones on and carry this cassette with them - and he actually laid his job on the line and said, \u2018If it doesn\u2019t take off , I will resign\u2019\u2026 and they didn\u2019t have much money at the time, so their advertising was very tight\u2026 and they decided to give it to students to try\u2026 and so people saw them on the trains, in campuses, in towns and the newspapers picked up on it immediately."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The Walkman was designed to be used with headphones - a pair of padded speakers worn over the ears so you can listen to music without other people hearing."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Akio Morita was confident his stereo plus headphones idea would take off - suddenly start to be successful and popular."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In fact, he was so confident of success that he laid his job on the line \u2013 an idiom meaning to risk losing something important, such as your job or reputation."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Luckily, he didn\u2019t lose his job because many people started buying the new Walkmans, something the newspapers picked up on - noticed or gave particular attention to."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Morita\u2019s idea was a massive success. Released at the start of the summer holidays for Japanese students, within 3 months the entire first run of 30 thousand Walkmans had sold out."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Meanwhile, music lovers outside of Japan were desperately trying to get hold of the new machines. Among the first to buy one was music journalist, Tim Jarman."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here he is speaking to Farhana Haider, for BBC World Service\u2019s Witness History:"},{"author":"Farhana Haider","text":"It was made available in the US in June 1980. The Walkman was especially popular with the 16 to 24 age group."},{"author":"Tim Jarman","text":"They thought it could be a niche product , that might not sell, but it really caught the public imagination in every market that it was offered in."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When the Walkman was sold to the rest of the world and became popular with youngsters, people thought it was a niche product - something marketed for sale to a small, specific group."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But instead, people of all ages began wearing Walkmans to listen to their favourite music on the move, and the new invention caught the public imagination \u2013 an idiom meaning, made the public interested in or excited about something."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Many put the Walkman\u2019s success down to its perfect combination of sound quality, small size and affordable price."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But exactly how affordable, Georgina? Remember my quiz question?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, Neil. You asked how much the original Walkman cost when it came out in 1979."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What did you say?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I thought it cost b) 100 dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Georgina, things were cheaper in 1979, but not that cheap \u2013 the actual price was c) 150 dollars."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s around 530 dollars today!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ve been looking back at the iconic Sony Walkman, the first portable stereo made up of a cassette player plus headphones \u2013 pairs of padded speakers worn over the ears."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Sony chairman Akio Morita was so confident his invention would take off \u2013 become popular and successful - that he laid his job on the line . That means risked something important, like his job."},{"author":"Neil","text":"His colleagues at Sony worried the Walkman was a niche product \u2013 a product targeted for sale to a niche, or small and specific, market."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But luckily for him, the Japanese newspapers picked up on his idea \u2013 noticed it and gave it particular attention. As a result, the Sony Walkman caught the public imagination - made the public excited and interesting in it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme.
