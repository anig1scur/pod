We\u2019ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons."},{"author":"Dan","text":"You know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they\u2019re not that new, either."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh really?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, that\u2019s the perfect opportunity to ask this week\u2019s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It must be 1982. I\u2019ll go with c)."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right or wrong later in the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what\u2019s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Good point. Emoticons came first. They\u2019re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard \u2013 usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon \u2013 two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It\u2019s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you\u2019ll have to convince me \u2013 why do people use them so much?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, let\u2019s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code:"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Professor Vyv Evans, Author of \u2018The Emoji Code\u2019 They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication. Increasingly, what we\u2019re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face-to-face interaction . In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ok so he used a very useful word - empathy . It means \u2018the ability to show you understand someone else\u2019s feelings\u2019. Ok \u2013 tell me more Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes \u2013 adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy \u2013 more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction \u2013 as he says."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Interaction , meaning \u2018when people or things communicate with each other\u2019. We can also interact with things like machines, computers and social media."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we\u2019re talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow, that\u2019s a lot. A cue is a signal that you need to do something."},{"author":"Dan","text":"For example, an actor goes on stage after their cue ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And non-verbal means \u2018without using spoken language\u2019. So, here in the studio there are lots of other non-verbal signals about how we\u2019re feeling - non-verbal cues . For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"There\u2019s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let\u2019s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer \u2013 how would you respond?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"If I followed it with a sad face emoji, then\u2026?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Then I guess I\u2019d know you hurt yourself. Poor you."},{"author":"Dan","text":"But if I followed it with a laughing emoji \u2013 the one with the tears coming out because I\u2019m laughing so much?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Then I\u2019d probably reply saying how stupid and clumsy you are!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly \u2013 without adding the emoji \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the non-verbal cue \u2013 like my facial expression."},{"author":"Neil","text":"By the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy ? Clumsy , means \u2018physically awkward\u2019 \u2013 someone who\u2019s clumsy falls over a lot and drops things.Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren\u2019t as new as I think?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said 1982."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like a winking face?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error \u2013 or what we normally call a typo ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A typo \u2013 a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly."},{"author":"Dan","text":"The official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in a digital communication."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow, so they\u2019re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let\u2019s round up with another look at today\u2019s words."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Sure. The first word we had was empathy . Do you have a lot of empathy , Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I think I\u2019m quite good at understanding other people\u2019s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It\u2019s important to empathise with your colleagues too."},{"author":"Dan","text":"That\u2019s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Nicely done. If two people interact , it means they \u2018communicate with each other and react to each other\u2019. It\u2019s a pretty broad term."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We could also talk about how the way children interact with the internet."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Way too much! Next up, we had non-verbal , meaning \u2018without spoken language\u2019. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Next word\u2026 that is my cue to say the next word \u2013 which is in fact \u2013 cue . A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a cue to attack. Or I could give you a cue to\u2026 sing a song?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No thanks. I\u2019ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like clumsy \u2013 meaning \u2018physically awkward\u2019. I\u2019d have to say Dan, you\u2019re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you\u2019re not clumsy at all."},{"author":"Dan","text":"That\u2019s what I thought until I broke my leg \u2013 after a clumsy opponent ran into me\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ouch. Finally \u2013 we had type. No hang on, that\u2019s not right. It should say typo . A typo is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Always check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil. And, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
