But things have changed a lot from the days when most birthday cakes were homemade \u2013 made at home and not bought from a shop. Nowadays many birthday cakes are works of art \u2013 extravagant, edible creations designed and decorated to represent the person celebrating their birthday."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme we\u2019ll be hearing from two bakers \u2013 a famous TV chef who bakes simple but tasty cakes, and another who\u2019s designed personalised birthday cakes for celebrities, including Arnold Schwarzenegger. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Sounds good. But first I have a question for you, Neil. Everyone looks forward to their birthday, especially if there\u2019s cake, but according to the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics, which is the most common month to be born? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm that's an interesting question and I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s September."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. One of Britain's best loved cake bakers is Dame Mary Berry. Here she describes her perfect birthday cake to BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."},{"author":"Dame Mary Berry","text":"My perfect cake would be something in lemon or orange because those are my favourite flavours. I don't mind how higgledy-piggledy it is, doesn\u2019t take a long time to do, but beautifully fresh and beautifully flavoured. Simple."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Mary Berry thinks a simple birthday cake is best. She doesn\u2019t mind if the decoration is higgledy-piggledy \u2013 mixed up and in no particular order."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Yes, when it comes to birthday cakes, flavour is more important than decoration for Dame Mary Berry. But now, a new generation of bakers is making cakes in a totally different way. The cakes Adam Cox makes in his East London bakery are truly fantastic-looking creations. Here\u2019s Adam speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme:"},{"author":"Adam Cox","text":"I get asked to do all sorts. My customers and clients are very generous with the leeway that they give me based on the past designs that I've made that they've seen, so they're happy to just leave it with me\u2026 I really just want to create something that will, you know, last long in the memory for the person that I do it for. It's a real pleasure to have this as a job because, as I say, it gives me a lot of freedom to express myself creatively, so I really try and go above and beyond to give the client something that, you know, they will be really happy with and\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Adam gets asked to make all sorts , meaning many different kinds, of cakes. His customers, who want the cake to be a special part of a birthday party, give him lots of leeway , lots of freedom to make the cake the way he wants to. Adam finds out about the person\u2019s interests and hobbies, and uses these to come up with decoration ideas."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Adam loves his job. It gives him the freedom to express himself creatively, and he enjoys seeing his customers\u2019 reaction when the finished cake is revealed. Adam goes above and beyond to satisfy his customers. If you go above and beyond , you do something with more effort than would normally be expected."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the result of Adam\u2019s extra effort? Birthday cakes which last long in the memory , a phrase describing something which creates such a strong impression that it\u2019s remembered for a long time\u2026"},{"author":"Beth","text":"\u2026or at least until the following year, when another birthday comes around and it\u2019s time to start baking all over again!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And speaking of birthdays coming around, what was the answer to your question, Beth? You asked me which was the most common month to be born in the UK\u2026"},{"author":"Beth","text":"And you guessed it was September, which was\u2026 the correct answer! Babies born in the UK peak in September. Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with homemade \u2013 an adjective describing something which is made at home and not bought from a shop."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If something is higgledy-piggledy , it\u2019s mixed up and in no particular order."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The phrase all sorts means many different kinds of something, like the sweets called Liquorice Allsorts which come in different shapes and colours."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If someone gives you leeway to do something, they give you the freedom to do it the way you want to."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The idiom to last long in the memory means to create such a strong effect that it is remembered for a long time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, when someone goes above and beyond , they do something with much more effort than would usually be expected. Once again our six minutes are up. If your birthday is coming up, we hope you have a cake with candles and make a wish to join us again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English.
