Robots can perform many tasks, but they\u2019re now being introduced in social care to operate as carers, to look after the sick and elderly. We\u2019ll be discussing the positive and negative issues around this but first, let\u2019s set you a question to answer, Sam. Are you ready for this?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Fire away."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Do you know in which year was the first commercial robot built? Was it in \u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"They\u2019re not a brand new invention, so I\u2019ll go for 1954."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, we\u2019ll I\u2019ll tell you if you\u2019re right or wrong, at the end of the programme. So, let\u2019s talk more about robots, and specifically ones that are designed to care for people. Traditionally, it\u2019s humans working as nurses or carers who take care of elderly people - those people who are too old or too unwell to look after themselves."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But finding enough carers to look after people is a problem \u2013 there are more people needing care than there are people who can help. And recently in the UK, the government announced a \u00a334 million fund to help develop robots to look after us in our later years."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, robot carers are being developed but can they really learn enough empathy to take care of the elderly and unwell? Empathy is the ability to understand how someone feels by imagining what it would be like to be in that person's situation."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, let\u2019s hear about one of these new robots now, called Pepper. Abbey Hearn-Nagaf is a research assistant at the University of Bedfordshire. She spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours programme and explained how Pepper is first introduced to someone in a care home\u2026"},{"author":"Abbey Hearn-Nagaf, research assistant, University of Bedfordshire","text":"We just bring the robot to their room. And we talk about what Pepper can't do, which is important so we can't provide physical assistance in any way. It does have hands, it can wave... when you ask for privacy, it does turn around and sort of cover its eyes with its hands but that's the most it does.  It doesn't grip anything, it doesn't move anything because we're more interested to see how it works as a companion - having something there to talk to, to converse with, to interact with."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, Abbey described how the robot is introduced to someone."},{"author":"Sam","text":"She was keen to point out that this robot has limitations \u2013 things it can\u2019t do. It can wave or turn round when a person needs privacy \u2013 to be private \u2013 but it can\u2019t provide physical assistance . This means it can\u2019t help someone by touching or feeling them."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But that\u2019s OK, Abbey says. This robot is designed to be a companion \u2013 someone who is with you to keep you company - a friend in other words that you can converse or talk with."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, having a companion is a good way to stop people getting lonely, but surely a human is better for that \u2013 surely they understand you better than a robot ever can?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, innovation means that robots are becoming cleverer all the time. And as we\u2019ve mentioned, in the UK alone there is a growing elderly population and more than 100,000 care assistant vacancies. Who is going to do all the work?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think we should hear from Dr Sarah Woodin, a health researcher in independent living from Leeds University, who also spoke to the BBC\u2019s You and Yours programme. She seems more realistic about the introduction of robot carers."},{"author":"Dr Sarah Woodin, Leeds University","text":"I think there are problems if we consider robots as replacement for people. We know that money is tight - if robots become mass-produced there could be large institutions where people might be housed and abandoned to robots ... I do think questions of ethics need to come into the growth and jobs agenda as well because sometimes they're treated very separately."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, so Sarah Woodin suggests that when money is tight \u2013 meaning there is only just enough -  making robots in large quantities \u2013 or mass-produced \u2013 might be a cheaper option than using humans. And she says people might be abandoned to robots."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, abandoned means left alone in a place, usually forever. So she says it might be possible that someone ends up being forgotten and only having a robot to care for them. So is this right, ethically?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes well, she mentions ethics \u2013 that\u2019s what is morally right \u2013 and that needs to be considered as part of the jobs agenda. So, we shouldn\u2019t just consider what jobs vacancies need filling but who and how it should be done. And earlier I asked you, Sam, did you know in which year was the first commercial robot built? And you said?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said 1954."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well you didn\u2019t need a robot to help you there because you are right. Well done!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Now let\u2019s do something a robot can\u2019t do yet, and that\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve highlighted today, starting with empathy."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Empathy is the ability to understand how someone feels by imagining what it would be like to be in that person's situation."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Physical assistance describes helping someone by touching them."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We also mention a companion \u2013 that\u2019s someone who is with you and keeps you company."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Our next word was tight \u2013 in the context of money, when money is tight it means there is not enough."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Abandoned means left alone in a place, usually forever."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, we discussed the word ethics \u2013 we hear a lot about business ethics or medical ethics \u2013 and it means the study of what is morally right."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, thank you, Sam. Well, we\u2019ve managed to get through 6 Minute English without the aid of a robot. That\u2019s all for now but please join us again soon. Goodbye!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bye bye everyone!"}],"authors":["","Rob","Sam","Abbey Hearn-Nagaf, research assistant, University of Bedfordshire","Dr Sarah Woodin, Leeds
