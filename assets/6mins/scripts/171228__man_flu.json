Are you ok?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think I\u2019m coming down with something serious."},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s just a case of the sniffles . Neil The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose \u2013 usually when we are sick.

What\u2019s it about anyway?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s about \u2018man flu\u2019, and whether it\u2019s actually real, or just something men like to complain about.

The threat of \u2018man flu\u2019 is real."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, we\u2019ll find out later, but let\u2019s clarify. \u2018 Man flu\u2019 is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, let\u2019s hear from this British couple about whether they think \u2018man flu\u2019 is real or not."},{"author":"Vox","text":"British Man Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu."},{"author":"British Woman","text":"Yeah, I\u2019m not so convinced.

And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn\u2019t really do anything, so\u2026"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And it seems that it\u2019s not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe."},{"author":"Vox","text":"BBC Journalist You\u2019re from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?"},{"author":"Dutch woman","text":"Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah."},{"author":"BBC Journalist","text":"What have you accused him of doing?"},{"author":"Dutch woman","text":"\u2026 whining ?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Whining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there\u2026but nothing has been proven, right?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to \u2018man flu\u2019 after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Symptoms are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is."},{"author":"Doctor Kyle Sue","text":", Memorial University, Newfoundland It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue\u2019s research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That\u2019s it then! Man flu is real! Dan Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as \u2018man flu\u2019. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only \u2018suggestive\u2019 and are not \u2018definitive\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, basically he\u2019s saying that there is a suggestion that \u2018man flu\u2019 exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week\u2019s quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said 3 days."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you were right!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good! Dan The men said they took twice as long to recover! Neil It must be all that manly testosterone. Let\u2019s review our vocabulary, shall we?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Our first was the sniffles . If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What's the best cure for the sniffles Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your runny nose . That\u2019s when a person\u2019s nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Next we had soldier on . This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to soldier on , Neil? Neil A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had \u2018 man flu\u2019. That\u2019s is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan? Dan I\u2019m sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining . If you whine , you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way. Neil Like my children did last time I didn\u2019t buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms . These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan? Dan A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that\u2019s the end of this 6 Minute English! Don\u2019t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it.
