I\u2019m Phil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Today we\u2019re going to be talking about an interesting approach to the problem of invasive species. When animals or plants are introduced to new areas, they can be dangerous for existing wildlife."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Tell me about it! Every time I plant something in my garden, squirrels dig it up. I\u2019m getting really fed up with them."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Have you tried eating them?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Sorry, what? Eat the squirrels?"},{"author":"Phil","text":"That\u2019s right! One of the simplest ways to deal with invasive species is just to eat them. In this programme we\u2019ll be hearing about initiatives in the UK and Belize that are trying to get people to improve things using their stomachs."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, but before that, I\u2019ve got a question for you, Phil. Lionfish are aggressive predators which hunt over 50 different varieties of fish. To help them do this, their stomachs can expand, but by how much?"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Wow, those numbers all seem incredibly big \u2013 I mean it can\u2019t be more than 10 times can it?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Before that, let\u2019s get back to your squirrel problem! There\u2019 a restaurant in London that offers squirrel kebabs. They specialise in food made from invasive species, so if that\u2019s not to your taste you could try Japanese knotweed beer."},{"author":"Myra Anubi","text":"Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive plant that arrived in Europe from Japan over a century ago, this super weed doesn't just grow fast. It has root systems that are so strong and resilient that they can withstand molten lava choke out surrounding plants and cause a lot of damage to buildings."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Myra tells us that Japanese knotweed is resilient . If something or someone is resilient then it means that it or they can resist attempts to stop them."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And another word for \u2018resist\u2019 is withstand . If you can withstand an attack or damage then you don\u2019t let it affect you. We heard that Japanese knotweed\u2019s roots can withstand lava from a volcano."},{"author":"Phil","text":"We also heard that Japanese knotweed can \u2018 choke out\u2019 other plants. By this we mean that it takes the space and the resources such as light and water that they need to survive."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And knotweed is not the only invasive species problem with a tasty solution. In Belize, since 2008 lionfish have had a massive impact on coral reefs and native wildlife. They can eat four times as much as native species. BBC World Service programme \u2018People Fixing the World\u2019 went to investigate. Here\u2019s Marisol Amaya talking to Celso Sho from marine conservation NGO, \u2018Blue Ventures\u2019 about attempts by the Belizean government to get people to eat lionfish."},{"author":"Marisol Amaya","text":"With a big campaign slogan \u2018Eat the lion\u2019, they got renowned chefs to prepare it in exotic ways to raise awareness that eating lionfish was both tasty and helping the environment."},{"author":"Celso Sho","text":"We have developed awareness for the restaurants to purchase it. We had a lot of outreach trying to erm show fisheries , the general public how to remove the spine, then that allows them actually eat the meat from the fish."},{"author":"Phil","text":"We heard the Belizean government asked renowned chefs to prepare lionfish dishes. \u2018Renowned\u2019 means to be well-known for being very good at something."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Celso Sho talked about outreach work. Outreach is where an organisation brings their work to people through events or publicity."},{"author":"Phi","text":"Fisheries are either the business that breed and catch fish to sell, or the places where that happens."},{"author":"Beth","text":"So, in Belize people are being shown attractive ways to eat lionfish. And speaking of lionfish and eating, I think it\u2019s time I revealed the answer to our quiz. I asked you by how much can a lionfish expand it\u2019s stomach to eat more."},{"author":"Phil","text":"And I thought it was 10 times."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But you were wrong unfortunately, a lionfish can actually make its stomach 30 times bigger. That might help to explain why they are a such a danger to native Belizean fish. OK, now let\u2019s recap the vocabulary that we\u2019ve looked at today. If something is resilient , then it\u2019s very hard to damage."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Yes, you could say that it can withstand a lot of damage \u2013 it can cope with it."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If one plant chokes out another, then it takes away the resources needed to live."},{"author":"Phil","text":"If you are renowned for something, then you are famous for what you do."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Outreach is how organisations bring their work to people."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Fisheries are the companies that catch and sell fish or the places where they do it. That\u2019s all we\u2019ve got time for today, maybe you might want to see if there any invasive species near you that you might want to eat. See you next time!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Phil","Beth","Myra Anubi","Marisol Amaya","Celso
