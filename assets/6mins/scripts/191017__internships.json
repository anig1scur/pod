Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme. James Turner is the chief executive of an education charity. Recently he took part in a discussion on the BBC radio programme You and Yours, on the topic of internships . What does he think is a big issue with unpaid internships ?"},{"author":"James Turner, Chief Executive, The Sutton Trust","text":"In many careers we\u2019re now seeing that it\u2019s almost as an expectation that a young person does an internship before they stand a chance of getting that first full-time job in that profession. And the issue with that from a sort of social mobility point of view is that a substantial proportion of those internships are unpaid and that effectively rules out those who can\u2019t afford to work for free."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So what is the problem with unpaid internships , Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, if you can\u2019t afford to work for free, it makes it very difficult to do an internship \u2013 particularly in expensive cities like London. This excludes, or rules out a lot of people from the benefits of an internship ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This is bad for social mobility , which is the ability of people to move to higher, better paid levels in society.

This means they have some pre-existing link with the company, for example, through family or friends\u2019 families."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, it\u2019s a lot easier if your family is well-connected , if it has a lot of contacts and links to a particular company or important people in that company."},{"author":"Rob","text":"These links make it easier to open doors to the opportunity. To open doors is an expression that means to get access to."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So it seems that to be able to do an unpaid internships you need to have a fair bit of money and to get an internship in the first place you may need to have a previous link to the company through a family connection, for example."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So the system would seem to be difficult for poorer families and make it more difficult for students without those resources or connections to get on the job ladder.
