I'm Dan\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil. In this episode we'll be discussing water burial."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes. It\u2019s a bit of a bleak subject, I\u2019m afraid."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Something which is bleak is unpleasant or without hope."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And, do you know what\u2019s really bleak ? It\u2019s this week's question. On average, how many people die each hour?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I am going to guess b) sixty thousand"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And we'll find out if you're right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 55m people each year. Now, religious or not, there is a practical issue to be dealt with, which is, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"What to do with the body? Dan Exactly! So what are the options for the average person?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, there\u2019s burial, or there\u2019s cremation."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Burial is when a body is put into the earth and cremation is when a body is burnt. But there are big problems with both. For example, what two things do most people need in order to be buried?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, a coffin \u2013 or a box to put the body in and a grave . That\u2019s the place the coffin and body go into."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly, but coffins are most often made of wood. In the US they use four million acres of forest every year just to make coffins. And as for graves , cemeteries are beginning to get overcrowded \u2013 there\u2019s no space left! After all, dying is not exactly a new thing! It\u2019s been happening for years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Aha, but with cremation, there\u2019s no space needed. And they burn gas to dispose of the body. That\u2019s got to be better. Dan You\u2019d think so, but no. I\u2019ll let Sahar Zand, reporter for the BBC, explain why."},{"author":"INSERT ","text":"Sahar Zand, BBC reporter During the process, a number of toxins can be emitted into our environment, including mercury from dental fillings. Cremation also has a carbon cost. With the energy used to process one body, you could actually heat a home for the best part of a week in winter"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So cremation can release toxins , or poisons, into the environment and it comes with a very high energy cost \u2013 enough to heat a home for almost a week! OK. I can see a smug look in your eye, Dan. What do you have up your sleeve?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s the latest thing. Water burial."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Water burial?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"This is where the body is put into an alkali solution and heated to 150 degrees centigrade. This breaks down the tissue and leaves only the skeleton."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Interesting."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes! It has huge advantages over cremation"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Such as?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well for one thing, it takes only 4 hours to finish. It follows the same process as when a body decomposes , but quicker."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When something decomposes it breaks down and decays. Ok, anything else?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It uses much less energy. Each body is weighed and then the computer calculates exactly how much of everything is needed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ok, it\u2019s more efficient too. Why are you smiling?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"This is the best part! Listen to Sahar again."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Sahar Zand, BBC reporter All that\u2019s left at this point is a brittle skeleton and any artificial implants that they may have had in their body \u2013 and they come out almost as good as new. There\u2019s even talk of sending the implants to the developing world, where they can benefit populations that don\u2019t have access to them, because they\u2019re very expensive."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So after the process you have a brittle, or easy to break, skeleton and any implants that they had inside them."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Implants are artificial additions to the body, such as plastic hips or an artificial heart. And they\u2019re clean! They can be recycled and given to someone who needs them! Isn\u2019t that cool?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, what happens to the skeleton?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It gets ground up into dust and put in a jar to give to the family \u2013 exactly the same as a traditional cremation. I love it! Sign me up! Would you like to give it a shot?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I can\u2019t answer that question. But can I have the answer to our quiz question?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Of course. I asked: On average, how many people die each hour?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said b) sixty thousand"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you, my friend, are dead in the water. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a) six thousand"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ok. Well that\u2019s probably better, isn\u2019t it?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes. Neil Shall we have a look at the vocabulary then?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Certainly. Our first word was bleak meaning something unhappy, unpleasant or without hope. What types of things do we typically describe as bleak, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, the weather in the UK can be bleak. It\u2019s very, very dark in the winter. Next we had grave . A grave is a hole in the earth where a body is placed. However, there is another use."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes. We can talk about a situation being grave . The outbreak of war is a very grave situation for many people. Then we had toxin . A toxin is a substance which is poisonous. Have you ever been poisoned by a toxin, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I suppose so, yes. I\u2019ve had food poisoning and that\u2019s caused by toxins .  After that was decompose . When something decomposes , it breaks down and decays. Much like when fruit goes bad and turns black and then becomes liquid."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Then we had brittle . Something which is brittle is easily broken. For example, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Glass, crockery, tiles and some plastic. Crisps! And finally we had implant . An implant is something artificial which has been put into the body \u2013 such as an artificial heart or a replacement hip. Would you like to have any implants, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019d quite like robotic legs. Then I could run faster than anyone!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we\u2019ve run out of time, so that\u2019s the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there."},{"author":"Both","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Dan","Neil","INSERT
