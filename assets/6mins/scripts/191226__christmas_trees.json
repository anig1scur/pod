This is 6 Minute English with me, Neil. And joining me today is Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hello."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, Sam, are you feeling excited about Christmas?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course! Time with friends and family, eating lots, partying, presents \u2013 and generally indulging \u2013 what\u2019s not to like?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indulging \u2013 allowing yourself to have perhaps too much of something you enjoy.  Well, it only happens once a year, Sam. But for those of us who do celebrate Christmas, it comes at a price."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, well buying all those presents can be expensive."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not just that, Sam. I mean it comes at a cost to the environment, as we\u2019ll explain shortly. But let\u2019s start off with a quiz question for you to answer.  In 2010, a Christmas tree in Belgium was awarded the world record for having the most lights on it \u2013 but do you how many? Were there\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I don\u2019t think you could fit 194, 673 lights on a Christmas tree, so I\u2019ll say a) 19,672."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, we\u2019ll find out how \u2018bright\u2019 you are at the end of the programme! Of course, Christmas trees are the ultimate Christmas decoration. It\u2019s part of the Christmas tradition and millions are bought around the world each year. But what impact do Christmas trees - real and artificial - have on the environment?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well before we answer that, let\u2019s hear from some of the BBC Learning English team who  chose to have a real Christmas tree in their home and find out why\u2026 Phil Well, you've got the smell of it. You've got the look of it. But more importantly, it\u2019s Christmas trees are supposed to be symbolic , aren't they? So the idea of something that stays green all year, so bringing that into your house it, it means something."},{"author":"Jiaying","text":"I just think a real Christmas tree is more festive and more Christmassy. And it's just the tradition to get a real Christmas tree, that's all."},{"author":"Roy","text":"There\u2019s something more beautiful about the nature, the smell, the feel, the look of the tree and I like it to be sustainable . So, as long as I get my tree from a person that promises to grow two or three in its place, then I'm really, really happy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I agree \u2013 you can\u2019t beat having a real Christmas tree. And as Phil said, it\u2019s symbolic \u2013 it represents something important \u2013 and here a Christmas tree is the symbol of Christmas."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And as Jiaying mentioned, it\u2019s a tradition \u2013 something that\u2019s done regularly and has become the expected thing to do \u2013 and I\u2019d agree it makes things more festive \u2013 a word to describe the joyful feeling you get when celebrating something like Christmas."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But of course all these trees are often thrown away, which is wasteful. That's why Roy mentioned his tree being sustainable \u2013 which means they can continue to be grown and cut down over a longer period so it\u2019s less harmful to the environment."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, an alternative to a real Christmas tree is a fake or artificial one, which is what Feifei from our team has in her house. What are the reasons why?"},{"author":"Feifei","text":"We have a plastic Christmas tree, which we've had for about nine years. So it's plastic so you can re-use it every year and it's more economical , and we don't have to keep buying new trees."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Feifei\u2019s fake tree is made of plastic \u2013 so that\u2019s not great for recycling \u2013 but the good thing is she uses it year after year which makes it economical \u2013 which means it doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money, it\u2019s good value."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah, but even Feifei admits it doesn\u2019t have the smell and feel of a real tree. It\u2019s a dilemma isn\u2019t it, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 what\u2019s best for us and what\u2019s best for the environment? The BBC\u2019s Reality Check programme found that real trees take about 12 years to grow and as they do, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere and nitrogen from the soil \u2013 so a good thing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But when it\u2019s chopped down it starts to release emissions back into the atmosphere \u2013 especially if you have to transport it to your home. And when Christmas is over, if it ends up in landfill, the tree\u2019s carbon footprint will be higher."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But its carbon footprint will be lowered if it\u2019s recycled or composted \u2013 that\u2019s the process of allowing it to decay and then adding it to the ground to improve soil quality. A fake tree on the other hand is usually imported, and can\u2019t usually be recycled but, as Feifei mentioned, it can be re-used.  But without any type of Christmas tree, where would we put all those lights I mentioned earlier, Sam? I asked you: In 2010, a Christmas tree in Belgium was awarded the world record for having the most lights on it \u2013 but did you know how many? What do you say, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think I said 19,672."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ooo, not very bright I\u2019m afraid! There were in fact 194, 672!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Wow \u2013 think of the electricity that must have used!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed. Well let\u2019s enlighten everyone with some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed today."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, well we started talking about indulging \u2013 that means allowing yourself to have perhaps too much of something you enjoy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When something is symbolic , it represents something important.  And the word festive describes the joyful feeling you get when celebrating something like Christmas."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Like the festive jumper you are wearing today, Neil \u2013 very jolly! OK, next we mentioned sustainable \u2013 which means the ability to do something over a long period of time without harming the environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Economical describes doing something that doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money, it\u2019s good value."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And when something is composted , it is allowed to decay \u2013 and it turns in to compost which can be added back into the soil to improve its quality."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thank you, Sam.
