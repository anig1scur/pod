I'm Neil."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I'm Dan."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, Dan, have you ever wanted to become invisible ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Invisible \u2013 impossible to see. Of course! Who hasn't?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well how about this: most of us think we are in fact invisible, at least some of the time\u2026 We'll be looking at the ' invisibility cloak illusion ' in this programme."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Fascinating. And in that phrase we heard our first three words. Invisibility \u2013 the state of being invisible . A cloak is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the third word in that phrase \u2013 an illusion \u2013 is something that seems real but isn't."},{"author":"Dan","text":"OK, question time. Which of these stories features an invisibility cloak ? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I know they are all connected to invisibility, but I'm gonna say\u2026a) The Hobbit."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ok \u2013 we'll reveal the answer later on. Now, let's hear more about this invisibility cloak illusion . What's the theory, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right \u2013 imagine you're sitting in a crowded train. People are busy looking at phones and books, but they're also looking at each other."},{"author":"Dan","text":"They're 'people-watching', as we call it. Yes. Yes, I do that. I do it a lot, if I'm honest!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So \u2013 where does the invisibility part come in?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this. Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University. What did the Yale team find?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University"},{"author":"mismatch","text":"So this study, they asked people that, first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody, and how much they thought those people were observing them. And there was always a  . People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So, people think they observe others more than others watch them. Everyone thinks they aren't observed very much - it's almost as if they're invisible to others \u2013 or wearing an invisibility cloak !"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and think they're being watched is what she called a mismatch . It's the difference between two things \u2013 they're two things which don't 'match'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"In other words \u2013 it's not true that people aren't watching us \u2013 which is why the idea of having an invisibility cloak is just an illusion . This next bit is interesting. Two people were asked to wait in a room. Then they were each asked to make two lists: one, what they noticed about the other person; and two, what they thought the other person noticed about them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So list one was always longer than list two. Not only that \u2013 but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Let's hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday. What was the difference?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University When people are observing you they're doing it in a non- judgemental , fairly empathic way \u2013 and not actually noticing the things that you're self-conscious about. So if for example you feel self-conscious about a spot on your nose, or something that you're wearing, that won't be what they're noticing. It's a much less judgemental form of observation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, so even if we're feeling self-conscious about something \u2013 that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves \u2013 maybe our appearance or our clothes \u2013 we needn't be."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, you don't need to feel self-conscious . People aren't being judgemental ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And being judgemental means being critical."},{"author":"Dan","text":"That's good news. So even though all I'm thinking about is how badly I need a haircut, the other person is probably noticing something completely different. Back to the question about the invisibility cloak . Which story is it in?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said The Hobbit."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And it was in fact \u2013 Harry Potter. Not only does the garment make you impossible to see, it also protects you against magic spells."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow \u2013 I need one of those!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"In The Hobbit, it's a ring that makes you invisible , and in The Invisible Man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, before we become invisible ourselves, how about we go through today's words?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Marvellous. First we had invisible \u2013 which meansimpossible to see. You could say that stars are invisible during the day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"They're only visible at night."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We also had cloak \u2013 who would wear a cloak? Maybe a king or a monk? Or maybe you, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I'm sure I could look good in a cloak \u2013 that's a long piece of material worn over the shoulders. What about illusion ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Illusions appear to be true, but they're not. It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the illusion that everything he says is true. Then we had mismatch \u2013 which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there's a mismatch between what Michael says and what he does."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Who's Michael?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Just an example! You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple \u2013 they seem very different \u2013 they're a bit of a mismatch ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What is it with you and Michael?! One, he doesn't exist, and two, I think you're being judgemental ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I'm criticising him so, yeah, you're right \u2013 I'm being judgemental . Perhaps I should stop. It's just that\u2026 it's just that I'm in love with Simone myself, and I get all nervous and self-conscious when I see her."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you \u2013 you become self-conscious ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I do."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even though she doesn't exist either?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, only in my examples. Sometimes I wish I really did have an invisibility cloak ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hey, hang on, Dan - where have you gone?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Haha \u2013 very funny, I'm still perfectly visible.
