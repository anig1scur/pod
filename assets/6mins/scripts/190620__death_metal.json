But does it inspire its fans to appreciate violence? According to a new study, it does not. The death metal band Bloodbath might sing about cannibalism, but its fans do not go and eat their neighbours. Neil and Rob talk about this kind of music and teach you some vocabulary."],"this_week_question":["The electric guitar is an essential element to death metal music.

Not my cup of tea at all. What kind of person do you think I am?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s the point. The type of person who likes death metal may not be the kind of person you think they are. More on that shortly, but first, a quiz. The electric guitar is an essential element to death metal music.

Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s, or c) the 1940s?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I think quite early, so I\u2019m going to say the 1920s."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we'll see if you're right later in the programme. Does violent music give people violent thoughts? Recent research claims to have found the answer. This is how the topic was introduced on BBC News. What was the conclusion?"},{"author":"BBC News Presenter","text":"A psychological study of fans of death metal suggests that they are not desensitised to violence despite the genre\u2019s association with growling, often graphically violent lyrics including depictions of cannibalism . Researchers found that the main response of fans to the music they love was joy , not violence. Adding that most are very nice people who wouldn't dream of hurting anyone, let alone eating them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So what conclusion did the researchers come to?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, they found that the response to the music was joy , not anger or violence. It made people happy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There was a fear that listening to music with violent lyrics , which means violent words, would make people desensitised to violence."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If you are desensitised to something, you don\u2019t see it as unusual or unacceptable, it doesn\u2019t bother you."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The newsreader also said that the lyrics of death metal include topics such as cannibalism, which is the practice of eating human flesh. Listening to someone singing about eating people apparently didn\u2019t make them feel like snacking on their neighbours. Let's hear the introduction again."},{"author":"BBC News Presenter","text":"A psychological study of fans of death metal suggests that they are not desensitised to violence despite the genre\u2019s association with growling, often graphically violent lyrics including depictions of cannibalism .

The first ones were produced in the 1930s. So well done if, unlike Rob, you got that correct. Now, onto the vocabulary."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, we had a few words connected with music. We had genre for a style of music and also lyrics for the words of a song."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Some of the lyrics of death metal songs are about eating people, which is called cannibalism ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Cannibalism is a form of extreme violence and there was some concern that people exposed to such violent lyrics in songs might become desensitised to actual violence."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This means that they would accept violence as normal and not be worried by it.
