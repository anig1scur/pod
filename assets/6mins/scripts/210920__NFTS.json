This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"People collect all kinds of things for a hobby, from stamps and coins to comics and football stickers. Do you collect anything, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I used to have a big collection of Pok\u00e9mon cards but I have no idea where they are now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, maybe you should start looking for them because all kinds of collectables \u2013 that\u2019s objects that people want to collect \u2013 are selling for big money on the internet. It\u2019s all part of a new tech craze called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs for short."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Non-fungible tokens?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Basically NTFs are unique, one-of-kind items that can be bought and sold like any physical object but only exist in the digital world. \u2018Tokens\u2019 can be thought of as certificates of ownership for these virtual possessions."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, OK. I understand the \u2018token\u2019 part but what does \u2018 non-fungible\u2019 mean?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"If something is \u2018 fungible\u2019 it can be interchanged, like money for example. With money you can swap a \u00a310 note for two \u00a35 notes and it will have the same value."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, something non-fungible cannot be interchanged with something else. Is that because it has special features that make it unique?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exactly. Imagine something totally unique like the Mona Lisa. You can take a photo of the painting or buy a copy of it, but there will only ever be the one original painting."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I can see that the Mona Lisa is one-of-a-kind and extremely valuable, but it\u2019s not for sale on the internet!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"True, but lots of other things are, from signed celebrity artwork to virtual football cards. NFTs are like autographed photos \u2013 collectors want something no-one else has, even though there\u2019s nothing physical they actually own and keep."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the value of NFTs is going up and up?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Massively. A digital sticker of French footballer, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, recently sold for \u00a325,000! Which reminds me of my quiz question, Sam.

The sale started at $1000 but how much did the source code eventually sell for? Was it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you\u2019re asking me how much the internet sold for, I\u2019d say c) 5.4 billion dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out later if that\u2019s right."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Sir Tim Berners-Lee famously never made any money from the World Wide Web, insisting that his invention should be free for everyone. But the world of NFTs is controversial and not everyone thinks Sir Tim should be getting involved."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s certainly the view of Shona Ghosh, technology editor at the \u2018The Insider\u2019 website, as she told BBC World Service programme, Tech Tent:"},{"author":"Shona Ghosh","text":"I think there\u2019s a balance to be struck between exploring new technologies and Sir Tim Berners-Lee is an amazing figure but NFTs are a wild west . Not everything associated with NFTs are rogue , but these so-called digital collectables are going for lots of money."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Internet NFTs are very new and there are no rules controlling what can be sold and for how much, so Shona describes them as a wild west ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The Wild West means a situation where people can do whatever they want because there are no laws or controls, like the early history of the western part of the United States."},{"author":"Sam","text":"She also calls some things about NFTs rogue - behaving differently from what\u2019s normal or expected, often in a way that causes damage."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Love them or hate them, there are strong opinions on both sides of the NFT debate, as Rory Cellan-Jones, presenter of BBC World Service\u2019s Tech Tent, explains:"},{"author":"Rory Cellan-Jones","text":"To some NFTs are a brilliant innovation which has promised to put a value on digital artefacts . To others they\u2019re little more than a dubious pyramid scheme with a damaging impact on the environment because of the way the tokens are created."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Some people are suspicious of the large amounts of money collectors are willing to pay, comparing NFTs to pyramid schemes - business tricks or scams where money is obtained dishonestly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But for others NFTs are a legitimate and useful way to put a price on rare digital artefacts \u2013 items, such as images, videos and music, that are produced and stored as electronic versions."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Items like, for example, the original source code for the internet. So how much money did Sir Tim Berners-Lee raise for charity when he sold it off, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In my quiz question I asked Sam how much the NFT of the original internet source code sold for at auction."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said c) 5.4 billion dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were\u2026 wrong! In fact it was less - 5.4 million dollars \u2013 but still far too expensive for me to collect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, now I\u2019m wondering how much my Pok\u00e9mon card collection would sell for. If only I could find it!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, while you look for your collection, Sam, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme all about NFTs which are digital artefacts or items that are produced and stored as electronic versions."},{"author":"Sam","text":"NFTs are virtual collectables \u2013 desirable objects that people search for and collect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And they are non-fungible meaning they have special and unique characteristics that cannot be interchanged with anything else."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If something is rogue it behaves in a different way from what\u2019s normal or expected, often causing damage."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The wild west describes a chaotic situation without laws or controls."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, a pyramid scheme is a business scam where money is gained dishonestly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you\u2019d like to know more about non-fungible tokens, bitcoin and other trending internet topics there\u2019s plenty to find on the BBC website."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And for more interesting conversation and useful vocabulary, remember to join us again soon here at 6 Minute English.
