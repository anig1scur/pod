Do you find them relaxing?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I wouldn\u2019t say relaxing exactly, but I get really involved in the story \u2013 trying to work out who the murderer is... then finding out on the last page."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That's interesting because today we\u2019ll be looking at how books can help us relax and feel more alive during troubled times. We\u2019ll be finding out how reading is one of the best ways to find relief from the pressures of modern life."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Neil, are you talking about \u2018Bibliotherapy\u2019?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Amazing detective skills, Georgina!  Exactly. \u2018Bibliotherapy\u2019 is the prescription of books as a remedy to sickness. It has been around since 2013, when the UK charity \u2018Reading Agency\u2019 published a list of books that doctors could offer to patients, tackling topics from depression to dementia to chronic pain."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Since then, 1.2 million readers have borrowed the scheme's books from libraries. It's so successful that it's about to be extended to children as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I wonder which books have been most popular over that time? In fact that\u2019s my quiz question for today. What is the best-selling book of all time?

Well, we\u2019ll find out later if you\u2019re right. In \u2018Bibliotherapy\u2019, people meet up to read together. Professor Philip Davis, who runs these reading groups, believes they help the participants \u2018come more alive\u2019. Here he is speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours about what he\u2019s discovered."},{"author":"Philip Davis","text":"Above all, that it\u2019s not to do with scanning , with quick reading, when they\u2019re reading literature . If they\u2019re just scanning, if you\u2019re just looking for information, you go fast, it\u2019s very easy, it\u2019s automatic but when literature begins to do something more complicated than that in an area that emotionally you care about. The brain begins to work from different parts, from a different hemisphere and it gets excited, it gets pre-emotional \u2013 you can see the brain coming to life and it\u2019s that life that is important in terms of these reading groups."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"One type of reading is scanning \u2013 reading quickly in order to find specific information or skimming the page to get a general understanding."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the real therapy happens when a group reads literature \u2013 written works such as novels, poems or plays which are thought to have artistic merit. When group members read literature their brains get excited and start working from a different hemisphere \u2013 a word meaning \u2018half a sphere\u2019 \u2013 usually half the Earth or in this case, the human brain."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Reading literature in this this way makes both the left and right hemisphere of the brain come to life - start to be activated again after a quiet period."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And it\u2019s this ' coming to life ' that proves the therapeutic effects of \u2018Bibliotherapy\u2019. Here\u2019s Professor Davis again explaining how the benefits of group reading are observed."},{"author":"Philip Davis","text":"There are two methods really \u2013 you can have ECG where you put electrodes on the scalp and it measures electricity so that you can have a print-off of a graph of the sudden leaps than can happen at particular moments in reading a poem or short story or you can go into the scanner, the FMRI, and there, the blood flow, the oxygen indicates again changes in the configuration of the brain as it takes in this new stimulus."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The benefits of reading literature with others can be felt by group members as they begin to feel more alive and able to cope with life\u2019s ups and downs. But they can also be measured scientifically by recording brain wave activity."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"This can be done by carefully attaching metal wires called electrodes to the reader\u2019s scalp \u2013 the skin under the hair on the head."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Brain activity is then measured by giving the reader a stimulus \u2013 something that encourages activity in people. In this case, it could be a poem or novel to read."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Or something really stimulating \u2013 like a detective story!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or a work of literature \u2013 which reminds me of today\u2019s quiz question.
