I'm Neil."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I'm Dan. Today we're talking about one of the last mysteries of science. No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home \u2013 but scientists struggle to explain how they do it."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We'll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that \u2013 I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you a cat person or a dog person ?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, that's easy \u2013 I'm a cat person , for sure. Dogs are just a\u2026 well, they are hard work, aren't they?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"If you say you are ' a cat person ' it means you prefer cats. ' A coffee person ' prefers coffee. A 'something' person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Back to the topic, I'm a cat person . But can you answer this, Dan? Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world's longest cat. How long is Omar? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I'm gonna say c) 180 cm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, from long cats to long-distance cats. Scientists were scratching their heads a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home. How did it do it?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"We say you ' scratch your head ' when you are confused about something. There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate \u2013 but we don't yet have the full answer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts \u2013 they let you know where you are. Visual landmarks also play a role, just as they do with humans. A landmark is something very easily recognised \u2013 a big building or mountain for example."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And what about this one: magnets are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a magnetic force."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles \u2013 it tells them where north is. It's thought they have some iron in their beaks."},{"author":"Dan","text":"But some scientists think mammals also have this capability."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So we have a few ideas \u2013 smell, landmarks , magnetic forces \u2013 but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Let's hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol What they do when they are in a new territory is explore it in a very systematic way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they'll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that's lost its territory probably does the same thing. They'll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they'll either come across the territory or they'll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Cats have a systematic approach \u2013 which means they use a system . Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one \u2013 until they have a strong mental map of the place."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 a mental map is a map in your head \u2013 stored in your memory. And the area cats explore \u2013 their home area - is called their territory . Cats are territorial \u2013 which means their territory is very important to them."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue \u2013 which is a landmark or a smell \u2013 that tells it where it is. Well, that's the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don't have enough data \u2013 that's enough information about this."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When there is a scientific breakthrough - we'll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope. For now, let's content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world's longest cat. How long, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I said 180 cm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Omar measures 120 cm \u2013 that's over two thirds of my height \u2013 and weighs a heavy 14 kg."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he'd be found in no time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He's a landmark in himself! Which reminds me \u2013 let's run through today's words again. If you're a cat person , you prefer cats. If you're an evening person \u2013 you prefer evenings."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I've always thought you were a kind person, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Indeed. We don't want the listeners to be scratching their heads ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, we can't confuse them! So let's explain the next one clearly \u2013 a landmark is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are. The bridges in London are landmarks ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And can we say the parks are magnets in summer? A magnet is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel \u2013 but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: territory is a noun \u2013 the area of land that an animal considers to be its own."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Animals who feel this strongly are described as territorial . Humans can be too \u2013 about land or subjects they feel they own or control."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And finally systematic : the adjective from system. We can talk about a systematic approach, a systematic solution, a systematic study\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And we have systematically worked our way through all of today's words!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Very good! Which means \u2013 it's time mention our own online territory \u2013 our website and social media pages."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of
