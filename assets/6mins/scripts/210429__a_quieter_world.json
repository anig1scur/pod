This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re talking about something that always surrounds us \u2013 noise."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, whether it\u2019s the natural sounds of birdsong, the wind blowing, or man-made noise, like traffic or music \u2013 there\u2019s always something we can hear."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course, there are sounds that we like to hear and then there are those sounds that really grate \u2013 annoy or irritate\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"\u2026 like the beeping sound on a reversing lorry or someone drilling a hole in the road."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed. Soon we\u2019ll be looking at the language of noise and hearing about ideas for making the world a quieter place. But let\u2019s kick off with a question about the measurement of sound, which is in units called decibels . According to a guide by the World Health Organisation, what is considered the highest level we can be safely exposed to for a maximum of eight hours? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I imagine it\u2019s quite low, so I\u2019ll go for a) 55 decibels."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, as always, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later. Now, let\u2019s sound out what people know about sound, starting with Julian Treasure, the founder of The Sound Agency. He spoke to the BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"He discussed why noise is a form of pollution. And it\u2019s bad for our health, but we don\u2019t always realise\u2026"},{"author":"Julian Treasure, Founder, The Sound Agency","text":"Sound has powerful effects on us all the time, even though most of the time we\u2019re not conscious of it because we\u2019ve kind of got into the habit of suppressing our listening. There\u2019s so much noise around us in cities that we get into the habit of ignoring it. Now that\u2019s not a great thing when the noise is having a bad effect on us."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Julian makes a good point \u2013 that sounds affect us all the time, even when we don\u2019t realise. We\u2019re not conscious of it \u2013 so we\u2019re not aware of it, but it is there. It may be irritating us, but we don\u2019t stop to think what it is that\u2019s annoying us."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"As Julian also said, we get into the habit of ignoring sounds. When you get into the habit of something, you start doing something regularly without even thinking about it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And another habit we get into is suppressing our listening \u2013 so, preventing or stopping ourselves from hearing the noises. But experts have found this isn\u2019t good for us. That noise in the background can lead to stress and mental health issues."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, we all need some peace and quiet. Of course, there are many techniques for reducing and absorbing noise. For example, trees are grown by motorways to absorb the traffic noise. At a large rock concert, acoustic screens are put up to stop the sound being heard too far away."},{"author":"Neil","text":"All sound ideas \u2013 I mean good ideas. But let\u2019s head to the world\u2019s noisiest city \u2013 Mumbai in India - where honking car horns are a big problem."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I love the sound of that word honk \u2013 a short, loud sound \u2013 but I don\u2019t like the actual noise. The People Fixing the World programme discussed this problem and met a woman who\u2019s been working for years to try and reduce noise levels and create quiet zones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"She\u2019s Sumaira Abdul Ali from the Awaaz Foundation, and she explained why honking horns was a hard thing to control\u2026"},{"author":"Sumaira Abdul Ali, the Awaaz Foundation","text":"Honking and noise in general in India is a medium of expression, of sadness, of happiness, of every kind. This is what I was told when I started working, that these are all Western ideas to want to control noise \u2013 Indians love noise! And it\u2019s about the noise, it\u2019s about the colour, it\u2019s about the laughter and happiness, we don\u2019t want to be like the West \u2013 you know, those kind of dull, boring people, who don\u2019t express themselves the way we do!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I like how honking a horn isn\u2019t just for road safety \u2013 it\u2019s almost another language. People express themselves \u2013 or show how they feel \u2013 by sounding their car horn. To control this noise \u2013 to be quieter - is considered a Western idea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But Samaira is trying to change drivers\u2019 behaviour, and after much effort, even got the police to run a campaign. If noise levels at traffic lights went over 85 decibels, the lights would remain on red for longer!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Sounds like a good idea! There\u2019s much more about this on the BBC\u2019s Fixing the World webpage. So, Neil you just mentioned 85 decibels. Is that the answer to the question you asked earlier?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Earlier I asked, according to a guide by the World Health Organisation, what is considered the highest level we can be safely exposed to for a maximum of eight hours?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said 55 decibels."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah Well, it is actually 85 decibels, Georgina. Bad luck. The permissible time for safe listening decreases as sound levels increase. So, for example, a sound as high as 100 decibels \u2013 the level produced by a subway train \u2013 can be safely listened to for only 15 minutes each day."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, that\u2019s good to know. Now, let\u2019s recap on some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve been discussing, starting with grate \u2013 spelt G-R-A-T-E \u2013 it means annoy or irritate."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When we are conscious of something, we are aware of it. And when we get into the habit of something, we start doing something regularly, often without even thinking about it."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Suppressing describes preventing, stopping or reducing something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Honk is the short, loud sound a car horn makes. Like this \u2013 honk."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I can hear you coming, Neil! Finally, to express yourself , means to show how you feel."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I must express my sadness because we\u2019re out of time now. But there are lots more 6 Minute English programmes to enjoy on our website at bbclearningenglish.com."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"We also have an app that you can download for free from the app stores and where you can download this programme.
