When I waitressed in cafes I was on my feet ten hours a day \u2013 it was exhausting!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Most people have had bad work experiences at one time or another - maybe a job that was boring, badly paid, or just working too much and getting burned out \u2013 lacking energy or enthusiasm because of working too hard."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But does work have to be like this? Since most of our waking day is spent at work, how can we make sure our job doesn\u2019t make us unhappy? That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, and, as usual, will be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sounds good, Beth, but first I have a question for you. The worst job I ever had was the summer I spent working as a portable toilet cleaner at music festivals, but according to a recent survey by Forbes magazine, what was voted the worst job in the UK? Was it:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I think the answer might be a call centre worker."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, it's interesting that survey was carried out in the UK, because being unhappy at work could be related to the British working culture which emphasizes working at a fast pace. Here\u2019s Damian Grimshaw, a Professor of Employment Studies at King's College, London, speaking with BBC Radio 4 programme, Analysis:"},{"author":"Professor Damian Grimshaw","text":"Really it\u2019s all about pace, cost efficiencies, meeting targets, deadlines\u2026 so this is why when people do surveys of what we call \u2018work intensity\u2019, so how hard you work, are you driven on pace?, is there a supervisor breathing down your neck?, we score really badly compared to European countries."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Compared to some European countries, British workers have to meet more targets and deadlines - a time or date by which a particular job must be finished."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The pressure to work quickly means you might have your boss breathing down your neck , an idiom meaning that someone is watching you very closely and checking everything you do\u2026 Not a nice feeling to have at work!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"That\u2019s right. A good job is about more than pay and conditions, it's one that uses your talents, and gives you some choice over how and when you work. In 2022, Britain's biggest employer, the National Health Service or NHS, lost more than 15,000 nurses, many quitting because of the long and inflexible working hours."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Another sector with long working hours is the construction industry. Low paid, dirty and physically demanding, construction workers also risk high levels of work-related injury. Here, Emma Stewart, co-founder of social business, TimeWise, tells BBC Radio 4 programme, Analysis, about her trial project to help builders enjoy their jobs more:"},{"author":"Emma Stewart","text":"In the work that we've done within the construction industry, we have trialled what we would call an \u2018output-based\u2019 way of working, which means we shift away from this sense of presenteeism, this sense of: you are paid by the day, you are on site from seven in the morning until the last person leaves, maybe seven in the evening\u2026 to a \u2018task-based\u2019 way of working, which means: you are going to do five tasks over the course of this day. When you've done those tasks, and you've done them well, you can go home, but we will still pay you the same amount for the day. They were able to deliver the projects that we worked on with them on time, on budget, but critically the feedback from workers was that work-life balance scores doubled, and they were able to reduce the amount of overtime that they did - it's a win-win."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Emma describes the current working patterns using the word, presenteeism \u2013 staying at work longer than usual, or going to work when you\u2019re ill, to show that you work hard. But this isn\u2019t an effective way to work. Emma thinks a task-based approach is better, both at getting the job done, and for improving work-life balance - the amount of time you spend at work, compared with the amount of time you spend relaxing with your family, and doing things you enjoy. In other words, flexible working is a win-win \u2013 a situation that\u2019s good for everyone involved."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe more flexible working would help some of the jobs I mentioned earlier in my question, Beth - according to a recent Forbes magazine survey, what was voted the worst job in the UK?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I guessed it was a job I've done myself - working in a call centre."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that was\u2026 the correct answer, although I think my summer job cleaning toilets was even worse! Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with burnout \u2013 lack of energy or enthusiasm because of working too hard."},{"author":"Beth","text":"A deadline is the time by which a particular job must be done."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If someone is breathing down your neck , they\u2019re watching you very closely and checking everything you do."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Presenteeism means staying at work longer than usual to show your employer that you work hard and are important to them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Work-life balance is the amount of time spend doing your job, compared with the amount of time you spend doing things you enjoy."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, a win-win is a situation or result that is good for everyone. Once again our six minutes are up. Join us again next time, but for now - get back to work!
