And an algorithm , by the way, is a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem. So can you tell me what was the name of the computer which famously beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov using algorithms in 1997? Was it\u2026 a) Hal, b) Alpha 60 or c) Deep Blue?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"I\u2019ll say Deep Blue. Although I\u2019m just guessing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Was it an educated guess, Tim?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"I know a bit about chess\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"An educated guess is based on knowledge and experience and is therefore likely to be correct. Well, we\u2019ll find out later on how educated your guess was in this case, Tim!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Indeed. But getting back to AI and what machines can do \u2013 are they any good at solving real-life problems? Computers think in zeros and ones don\u2019t they? That sounds like a pretty limited language when it comes to life experience!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You would be surprised to what those zeroes and ones can do, Tim.

You know, all these things.

You\u2019re far too important for that!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Good to hear! So things we take for granted are doing every day tasks like walking, picking something up, or recognizing somebody. We implement \u2013 or perform \u2013 these things without thinking \u2013 Whereas it\u2019s cutting edge research to try and program a machine to do them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Cutting edge means very new and advanced.

It\u2019s very strange.

Now, you said Deep Blue, Tim, and \u2026 that was the right answer!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"You see, my educated guess was based on knowledge and experience!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or maybe you were just lucky. So, the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue played against US world chess champion Garry Kasparov in two chess matches. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and was won by Kasparov.

The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Let\u2019s go through the words we learned today.
