But let\u2019s talk more about wine now. A glass of the stuff can be sipped and savoured or just glugged."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Glug is a good word, meaning drink in large gulps or mouthfuls - not something a wine expert would do. For some people, drinking and serving wine is almost an art-form."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you go to a restaurant, there might be a sommelier \u2013 a person whose job is to serve and give advice about wine. They may have had years of training to learn about the different types of wine and the individual flavours or aromas, known as notes ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This job has fascinated journalist and author Bianca Bosker. She wrote a book called \u2018Cork Dorks\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And here she is talking on the BBC World Service programme The Why Factor describing her fascination with sommeliers\u2026"},{"author":"Bianca Bosker, writer and author","text":"These were people who had taken wine, which I always thought of as a thing of pleasure, something you turn to after a long stressful day, and turned it into something approaching sheer God-awful pain. They licked rocks, trained their palates , they divorced their spouses to spend more time reviewing flash cards - they had hired voice coaches and memory coaches, they took dance classes to learn how to move more gracefully across the dining room floor."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Like me, Bianca thought drinking wine was a pleasurable activity \u2013 something that helped her relax after a long stressful day. So she was surprised at how sommeliers turned this activity into \u201csomething approaching sheer God-awful pain\u201d."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The word sheer is used to emphasise the amount of something \u2013 or to mean \u2018nothing but\u2019. She thought the work of a sommelier was nothing but pain \u2013 they seemed to dedicate their life to wine!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"One thing a sommelier does is train their palate \u2013 this is their ability to distinguish and appreciate different tastes \u2013 and identify types of good wine from their taste. I guess this is quite important."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But divorcing their spouses does sound a bit extreme!  I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t take it so seriously - I\u2019ll stick to drinking poorer quality, cheap red wine \u2013 sometimes called plonk !"},{"author":"Sam","text":"WeIl, Rob, cheap wine doesn\u2019t always have to be poor quality. Interestingly, there is some evidence that shows we only think wine tastes better because it\u2019s more expensive."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah yes, this is research Hilke Plassmann from INSEAD Business School in France spoke about on the BBC World Service\u2019s Why Factor programme. She\u2019s been looking into what influences consumer behaviour\u2026"},{"author":"Hilke Plassmann, from INSEAD Business School in France","text":"The price tag affects that region in your brain that encodes your liking of the taste, so in other words, you not only think that you like the more expensive wine more, you feel you like the more expensive wine more, because your brain region that encodes this feeling is influenced by the price tag."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, our brain is possibly playing tricks on us. When we see the price tag on a bottle of wine, our brain encodes the information and tells us how it should taste. Encodes means changes the information into something that we can use or understand. Drinking more expensive wine makes you think it tastes better. So perhaps, when buying supermarket wine or wine in a restaurant, it may be better telling yourself that the cheaper option is OK!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019ll drink to that! But I wonder how that most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at auction tastes? The one dating back to 1774 that you asked me about."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So you thought it sold for $20,800, but sorry, Rob, that\u2019s too cheap. It was in fact sold for $120,800. I assume it wasn\u2019t drunk."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I hope not. Well, I think I\u2019ll stick to my plonk for now, Sam. Plonk was one of our vocabulary words today and describes cheap, poor quality wine."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We also mentioned a connoisseur \u2013 someone who enjoys a particular thing and knows a lot about it."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A sommelier is someone who serves and gives advice about wine in a restaurant"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Sheer is a word used to emphasise the amount of something \u2013 or to mean \u2018nothing but\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A palate describes someone\u2019s ability to distinguish and appreciate different tastes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Finally, encodes means changes information into something we can use or understand.
