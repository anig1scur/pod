But Sam, there is some good news \u2013 boredom can be good for you."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Tell me more!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I will but not until I\u2019ve set you a question to answer. A survey by British newspaper The Mirror, found Peter Willis to be \u2018the most boring man in Britain\u2019. What \u2018boring\u2019 hobby did he have that earned him that title? Was it\u2026? a)    Collecting train numbers \u2013 that\u2019s train spotting, b)    Taking photos of letterboxes, or c)    Driving around roundabouts of the UK."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Wow \u2013 they all sounds deadly boring \u2013 but I imagine taking photos of letterboxes is the most boring \u2013 perhaps?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, as usual, I will give you the answer at the end of the programme. But, as you say, we might die of boredom following those hobbies \u2013 a phrase that expresses how extremely bored you are."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But not for everyone \u2013 boredom depends on your state of mind \u2013 some of us might find something boring while others might it fascinating."},{"author":"Neil","text":"True. But let\u2019s talk about feeling bored when we have nothing to do \u2013 not even trainspotting! Having nothing to do, or doing the same task again and again, can certainly be demotivating. But according to Sandi Mann, who was speaking on the BBC World Service\u2019s The Why Factor programme, being bored doesn\u2019t have to be boring \u2013 it can be good for us\u2026"},{"author":"Dr Sandi Mann, Psychology lecturer, University of Central Lancashire","text":"It's this emotion everyone thinks is so negative but there's a real positive to it too, there's a real upside to it. We become more creative, so for example, being bored allows our mind to wander, allows us to daydream, and that can actually lead us to problem solving and creativity. I fear that by swiping and scrolling our boredom away these days, that we're losing that creativity because we've got so much to entertain us - but it seems that the more we have to entertain us, the more bored we seem to be! And there's a reason for that \u2013 and that\u2019s because we actually get addicted to stimulation and to novelty ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Some interesting thoughts from Sandi Mann there. She says that there\u2019s an upside to boredom \u2013 that means a positive side to a bad situation. And that is, it can make us more creative."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s because when we have nothing to do, we allow our minds to wander. We can think freely, which might help us solve problems. This can\u2019t happen when, as Sandi says, we swipe and scroll our boredom away \u2013 referring to the movements we make on smartphones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, and it\u2019s smartphones we turn to for entertainment when we are bored \u2013 it gives us stimulation \u2013 it activates or enriches the mind. And it gives us something new, unusual and different to look at \u2013 what we can call novelty ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m sure many of us look at our phones when we are in a queue or sitting on a bus \u2013 just to prevent being bored \u2013 but it seems we should just sit and think. Let\u2019s take inspiration from Manoush Zomorodi \u2013 an author and host of the Zig Zag podcast. Here she is speaking on The Why Factor programme, explaining that it takes effort but it\u2019s worth it\u2026."},{"author":"Manoush Zomorodi, author and podcaster","text":"We think, who wants to be bored? What an awful sensation that is. And I think that the issue is with mind-wandering, you don't immediately get to roses and chirping birds, and amazing creative thinking - there is this uncomfortable period that you have to pass through where maybe you start thinking about  things you don't want to  think about or uncomfortable situations or unpleasant feelings that you have, that's why boredom I think has negative connotations 'cos we feel uncomfortable - but when we stick with it that's when the good stuff can come."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, we might think boredom as an awful sensation \u2013 or feeling \u2013 because that\u2019s when we start focussing on negative things. Manoush thinks that\u2019s why we have negative connotations with boredom."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A connotation is an emotion connected to a word. But if we work through the bad stuff and stick with it, amazing creative thinking can happen \u2013 as Manoush says \u2018the good stuff can come\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, basically, don\u2019t think of boredom as being boring! However, could this adjective be applied to the hobby that Peter Willis \u2013 the most boring man in Britain \u2013 does?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, Neil, you asked me what that hobby is. And I said he took photos of postboxes. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, you were! Congratulations. The former postman dreams of taking a photo of all of Britain\u2019s 115,000 postboxes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, good luck to Peter. I didn\u2019t realise there were so many postboxes in the UK!  So, we\u2019ve been talking about the benefits of boredom today \u2013 boredom is the state of feeling little excitement or enthusiasm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We mentioned the phrase to die of boredom which we use to express how extremely bored we are."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But boredom has an upside , which means it has a positive side to a bad situation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We heard the word stimulation which means activates or enriches the mind. And novelty which describes something that is new, unusual or different."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And we described a connotation \u2013 that\u2019s an emotion connected to a word."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I hope you haven\u2019t been bored listening to us!
