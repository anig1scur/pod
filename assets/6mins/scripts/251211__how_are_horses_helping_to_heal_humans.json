      "text": "I used to ride horses a lot actually. My favourite thing was to ride a horse through the countryside. I love horses. They're so majestic and lovely. The relationship between humans and horses has been close throughout history, but recently this has gone beyond riding horses for fun or using them for work. Equine Assisted Services, sometimes called horse therapy, is a health trend where caring and interacting with horses is used to heal physical and mental illness. Here's Datshiane Navanayaga, presenter of BBC World Service programme The Conversation, to explain:"

      "text": "Equine Assisted Services is an umbrella term \u2013 a term for a large number of different things which all belong to a single common category. So, horse therapy includes many activities, from feeling the horse's movement, which can help children with muscle disorders like cerebral palsy, to simply grooming the horse, which can help calm anxiety. Grooming a horse means cleaning and brushing the horse's coat of hair."

      "text": "Various animals can be used in therapy, but horses are particularly suitable as they're very sensitive to human emotions. Being in contact with them affects the limbic area of the brain, dealing with stress. In this episode, we'll hear more about the horses helping people work through mental, emotional and physical challenges. And, as usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary."

Is it: a)    horses always sleep standing up, b)    horses can make over 100 sounds, or c)    horses have almost 360-degree vision?"

They might want to have a cry which they've been holding on to. The horse regulates them."

      "text": "Horses really are special animals. They sense human feelings like fear or sadness through breath, heart rate and movement, and respond with gentleness and calm. This makes them perfect animal therapists. And that's not all! Right, Georgie? Let's find out the answer to your question."

    {
      "author": "Georgie",
      "text": "Yes, Neil. Well, I asked you which sentence about horses was true, and you said that horses can make over 100 sounds... Sadly, that was the wrong answer. The correct answer was c) horses have near 360-degree vision, which is surprising."
