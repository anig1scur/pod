To get on with someone is a useful phrasal verb, meaning to like someone and enjoy a friendly relationship with them."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which is really important if you work with them every day!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And there\u2019s another word to describe the good understanding and communication between two friends: rapport."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, how to build rapport and get on with people has been the subject of many self-help books over the years, and is the topic of this programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you and I must have great rapport, Georgina, because that leads perfectly onto my quiz question.

It sold over 30 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time \u2013 but what is it called? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I think I know this, Neil. I\u2019m going to say, c) How to win friends and influence people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the right answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When it comes to getting on with people, psychologist Emily Alison has a few ideas. She\u2019s built a career working with the police as they build rapport with criminal suspects."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Emily is the author a new book, \u2018Rapport: the four ways to read people\u2019 and, as she told BBC Radio 4 programme All In The Mind it isn\u2019t easy to get along with everyone:"},{"author":"Emily Alison","text":"I often describe rapport-building in a relationship as like walking a tightrope because you really do need to maintain that balance of being objective , treating people with compassion but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m sympathetic, I\u2019m collusive \u2013 it\u2019s that balance between judgement and avoidance."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Emily describes rapport building as like walking a tightrope , an idiom to describe being in a difficult situation which requires carefully considering what to do."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Building rapport with \"terrorists\" or violent criminals isn\u2019t easy. Emily doesn\u2019t sympathise with what they have done, but she tries to remain objective \u2013tobase her judgement on the facts, not personal feelings."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In her book, Emily identifies four main communication styles which she names after animals. The best at building rapport is the friendly and cooperative monkey."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Then there\u2019s a pair of opposites: the bossy lion, who wants to take charge and control things, and the more passive mouse."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here\u2019s Emily talking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s, All In The Mind, about the fourth animal, the T-Rex. Try to listen out for the communication style of this personality:"},{"author":"Emily Alison","text":"You\u2019ve got the T-Rex which is conflict \u2013 so this is argument, whether you\u2019re approaching it from a positive position where you can be direct, frank about your message or you approach that in a negative way by being... attacking, judgemental, argumentative, sarcastic , and that actually breeds the same behaviour back. So anyone who has teenagers will 100% recognise that\u2026 if you meet sarcasm with sarcasm, it\u2019s only going to go one way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"All four communication styles have good and bad points. On the positive side, T-Rex type people are frank \u2013 they express themselves in an open, honest way."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But T-Rex types can also be sarcastic - say the opposite of what they really mean, in order to hurt someone\u2019s feelings or criticise them in a funny way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, sarcasm is a strange thing - like saying, \u201cOh, I really like your haircut\u201d, when in fact you don\u2019t!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes. There\u2019s an English saying that sarcasm is the lowest form of humour, but I think British people can be quite sarcastic at times."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I can\u2019t image you\u2019d make many friends being rude to people. Maybe they should read Dale Carnegie\u2019s self-help book."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah yes, your quiz question, Neil. Was my answer right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In my quiz question I asked Georgina for the title of Dale Carnegie\u2019s best-selling self-help book about building rapport. What did you say?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said the book is called, c) How to win friends and influence people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is\u2026 the correct answer! And I guess you\u2019ve read it, Georgina, because you have lots of friends."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I hope you\u2019re not being sarcastic, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Absolutely not! I\u2019m not a sarcastic T-Rex type, more of a friendly monkey!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, well, let\u2019s stay friends and recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with rapport - a good feeling between two people based on understanding and communication."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you get on with someone , you like and enjoy a friendly relationship with them."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Walking a tightrope means to be in a difficult situation which requires careful consideration of what to do."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To be objective is to base your actions on facts rather than personal feelings."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When building rapport with someone, it\u2019s good to be frank \u2013 to express yourself in an open, honest way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But not sarcastic \u2013 to say the opposite of what you really mean, in order to hurt someone\u2019s feelings or criticise them in a humorous way."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, Neil, if we run over six minutes we\u2019ll break our rapport with the 6 Minute English producer, so that\u2019s all for this programme!
