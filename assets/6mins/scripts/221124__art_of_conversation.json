This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Recently I met up with an old school friend who I hadn\u2019t seen for years. We talked for hours\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It sounds like you had a good chinwag \u2013 a long and pleasant conversation between friends, which is great because in this programme we\u2019re talking about talking. We\u2019ll be discussing conservations \u2013 the exchange of ideas, thoughts and feelings that happens when people talk to each other. And as usual we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Sam","text":"With the rise of Twitter and social media, which encourages us to give our opinion on a subject without always listening in return, some think the art of conversation is being lost. But luckily, there are still millions of us who love to talk, chat, chinwag and chatter away. In fact, in 2012 a competition in Latvia broke the world record for the longest telephone conversation. So, Neil, my question is this: how long did this record-breaking conversation last? Was it: a) 24 hours and 4 minutes? b) 54 hours and 4 minutes? or, c) 84 hours and 4 minutes?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, I\u2019ll guess a) 24 hours and 4 minutes, after which they probably fell asleep!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme. During a long career, DJ and BBC radio presenter, Nihal Arthanayake, has had conversations with hundreds of people. Now he\u2019s used these experiences to write a book entitled, \u2018Let's Talk: How to Have Better Conversations\u2019. Here Nihal tells another radio presenter, Michael Rosen, of BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Word of Mouth, about the influence of his mother who also loved talking to people in her job as a nurse:"},{"author":"Nihal Arthanayake","text":"Well, it gave me the sense that you are enriched by listening. And this was of course, pre-social media which has of course encouraged us to project - to transmit - more than receive. So it meant that I guess I was conscious of experiences of others, and wanted to try and understand them. Also, partially, Michael, it was a survival instinct because I was a little brown boy in a predominantly white school, a state school in the 1980s."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For Nihal, good conversation involves listening as much as speaking. By listening we find out things about the person we are talking to which, in turn, help us understand ourselves. This is why Nihal says we are enriched by listening \u2013 we are improved by having something else added."},{"author":"Sam","text":"As a British Asian boy growing up in a white community, Nihal also thinks conversation was a way for him to make friends and find protection. He says having conversations was a s urvival instinct - the human instinct to do something in a dangerous situation that will keep them safe from harm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Nihal sees an important difference between \u2018listening simply to reply\u2019, and \u2018listening to understand\u2019. When we \u2018listen to reply\u2019, we are thinking about the next thing we want to say more than trying to understand the other person\u2019s point of view. \u2018Listening to understand\u2019, on the other hand, helps build bridges - improve relationships between people who are very different or do not like each other."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s Nihal again in conversation with BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Word of Mouth:"},{"author":"Nihal Arthanayake","text":"So conversation can build bridges , and it is proven through history that conversation has, and that conversation can be seen as an art form, and that's one of the things that I want us to understand \u2013 it's not just tittle tattle , it's not just shouting at each other on social media, it's not two politicians talking over each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good conversation brings people together, unlike tittle-tattle - talk about other people's lives that is usually unkind, disapproving, or untrue."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And good conversation involves taking turns, not talking over someone \u2013 trying to silence people by talking more loudly, forcefully, and persistently than them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hopefully, Nihal\u2019s tips can help us all have better conversations, encounter new ideas and make friends. So, Sam, did you do any of these things when you met up with your old school friend?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think so. We both listened to each other, there was no tittle-tattle but a little bit of gossip. Before we knew it a couple of hours had passed - but not as much time as those record-breaking telephone conservations I mentioned earlier."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, in your question you asked how long the world\u2019s longest telephone conversation lasted. It guessed it was an incredible 24 hours and 4 minutes\u2026 was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, Neil, I\u2019m afraid that was\u2026 the wrong answer. In fact, the record-breaking conversation lasted 54 hours and 4 minutes - about the same as 540 programmes of 6 Minute English!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme on the art of good conversations, starting with chinwag \u2013 a long and pleasant conversation between friends."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When something is enriched , it\u2019s improved by having something else added to it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The survival instinct is the basic instinct in humans and animals to do something in a dangerous situation that will keep them alive."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you build bridges , you improve relationships between people who are very different or do not like each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tittle-tattle is talk about other people's lives that is usually unkind, disapproving, or untrue."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, if you talk over someone , you silence or drown them out by talking more loudly than them. That\u2019s the end of our conversation, but remember to join us soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary. Bye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Sam","Neil","Nihal
