Many people have favourites \u2013 a favourite colour, a favourite flavour, a favourite word. What\u2019s yours, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm, my favourite colour is green, my favourite flavour is sweet-and-sour, and, well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my favourite, but there is a word I really like saying out loud \u2013 \u2018 nincompoop\u2019. It means a silly person."},{"author":"Sam","text":"For me, it\u2019s the taste of coffee, and the smell of lavender, or freshly baked bread."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Our favourite tastes, smells and colours are controlled by our five senses \u2013 sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. For most of us they don\u2019t mix. We see colours and taste flavours, but we can\u2019t taste sounds."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But that\u2019s not how everyone\u2019s brain works. Imagine being able to \u2018taste\u2019 every word that you hear. In this programme, we\u2019ll meet two sisters from Glasgow in Scotland who can do just that. And as usual, we\u2019ll learn some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Julie McDowall and her younger sister, Jen McCready, have synaesthesia , a neurological condition where two or more senses mix together. When synesthetes, as they\u2019re called, hear a word, their sense of taste also becomes activated. Words produce specific tastes on their tongues. For example, when Jen hears the name of her daughter, Sophia, she tastes pink marshmallows! And the name \u2018Leo\u2019 tastes like noodles."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ll hear more from the unusual sisters later, but first I have a question for you, Neil. We\u2019ve just heard what happens when Jen McCready hears the names \u2018Sophia\u2019, and \u2018Leo\u2019, but what does she taste when she hears the name \u2018Neil\u2019? a) eggs and bacon b) spaghetti hoops c) a jam sandwich?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I don\u2019t know what this says about me, Sam, but I\u2019m going to guess that it\u2019s c) a jam sandwich."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK. Don\u2019t worry, Neil - I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Synaesthesia isn\u2019t only about people, like Julie and Jen, who taste words - it can be a mixing of any of our senses. A synesthete may hear colours or see sounds. In fact, there could be as many as 150 different types of synaesthesia."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For the Scottish sisters, having synaesthesia is a gift, something Jen explained when she talked with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Jennifer McCready","text":"This is enjoyable, it\u2019s never anything that causes \u2026 the only thing I would say is it\u2019s quite hard if you\u2019re trying to eat healthily because if you hear a word that maybe tastes like tuna, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, I need to get a tune baguette now\u2019\u2026 You know, it\u2019s almost like being pregnant and having a craving \u2026 words can be so vivid that you want to eat that \u2013 that\u2019s the only negative I would say about it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"For Jen, the only drawback to synaesthesia is that it can be hard to eat healthily because hearing certain words produces a craving \u2013 a strong feeling of wanting a particular food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That could be because, for Jen, the sound of the word is so vivid \u2013 clear, detailed, and powerful in her mind."},{"author":"Sam","text":"There\u2019s still much doctors don\u2019t know about why some people experience sense mixing while most of us experience each sense in isolation, but it\u2019s clear that for Julie and Jen, synaesthesia makes the world a more interesting, colourful place."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Someone who can explain why so little is known about synaesthesia is Guy Leschziner, consultant neurologist at King's College London, and author of the book, \u2018The Man Who Tasted Words\u2019. Here he is speaking to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Guy Leschziner","text":"One of the problems with synaesthesia is for many years it\u2019s been dismissed, and it\u2019s been viewed as people with an overactive imagination , something not real but actually what research in recent years has taught us is that actually it does have an underlying neurological and genetic basis."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Guy says that in the past, synaesthesia was often dismissed \u2013 considered unimportant or uninteresting. Synesthetes were labelled people with overactive imaginations \u2013 a tendency to imagine things that are not true."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But research is showing that the causes of synaesthesia could run in the family.  Julie and Jen\u2019s brothers don\u2019t have synaesthesia, but Jen\u2019s daughter does. And with an estimated 4% of the world population having some form of sense mixing, a world of new and exciting possibilities is opening up to millions."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Exciting possibilities like tasting someone\u2019s name\u2026 Remember in my question I asked what synesthete, Jen McCready, tastes when she hears the name \u2018Neil\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, I guessed that \u2018Neil\u2019 tastes like a jam sandwich. Was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, Neil, no - you don\u2019t taste like a jam sandwich. In fact, when Jen hears the name \u2018Neil\u2019, she tastes spaghetti hoops! Oh well, it could be worse \u2013 the name \u2018Robert\u2019 makes Jen taste rotten eggs! Sorry to any Roberts listening."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned in this programme about synaesthesia \u2013 a neurological condition where two or more senses mix together."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A nincompoop is an informal way of saying a silly person."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A craving for something is the strong desire to have it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A vivid sensation is clear, strong and detailed in your mind."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When something is dismissed , it\u2019s considered unimportant or uninteresting."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, an overactive imagination is the tendency to imagine things that are not true. Once again, our six minutes are up! If you\u2019ve enjoyed this look into the weird and wonderful world of synaesthesia, we hope you\u2019ll join us again next time for more chat, interesting issues and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.
