This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Neil, this may sound a bit personal, but have you ever taken your clothes off?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Err, well, yes. Every day when I have a shower."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Of course. I mean in public \u2013 have you ever been naked in public?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No! Stripping off \u2013 or getting naked - publicly, is not my idea of fun. Who would enjoy doing that?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, naturists would. That\u2019s what we call people who think not wearing clothes outdoors is a healthy way to live, and it makes them feel good. We might also call them nudists, because they are nude."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, so naturists feel being naked is natural \u2013 it\u2019s not about them being interested in nature?!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Not necessarily, but we are going to discuss why being naked in nature might be good for us. But how about a question first, Neil? The act of swimming naked is informally called skinny dipping . The world\u2019s largest skinny dip took place in Ireland in 2018 - but do you know how many naked swimmers went into the sea? Was it approximately\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019d have to guess and say that only 250 people would be brave enough to run into the cold sea, naked!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, as always, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later. So, the idea of getting naked might fill you with dread - it might seem embarrassing - but some people do sunbathe naked on the beach or in their garden or they go to naturist holiday parks."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But naked rambling \u2013 walking naked in the countryside \u2013 might be taking it one step further. However, it\u2019s something Donna Price, a volunteer at British Naturism, is keen to advocate \u2013 or publicly support. Here she is, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme, explaining why\u2026"},{"author":"Donna Price, volunteer, British Naturism","text":"We enjoy the feeling of being at one with nature . If you haven't actually tried being naked in nature, naked outdoors, when you can feel the skin, the warmth air all over your skin, it's such a lovely feeling. There is a great feeling of liberation and freedom once you actually try naturism - and I would never advocate for someone to actually go out for a naked walk as the first thing they ever did - I just would not do that! You've got to be comfortable in your own skin so you do it at home, in your own garden maybe if you can - get comfortable with yourself, actually start to feel that being naked feels normal, which to me, it does."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, for Donna, naked rambling means she has a connection with nature, she feels part of it and it makes her feel good \u2013 that\u2019s the feeling of being at one with nature . Hmm, but couldn\u2019t you do that with your clothes on?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, she also mentions there\u2019s a feeling of freedom and liberation \u2013 that\u2019s being freed from something \u2013 here, it\u2019s freed from your clothes."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Donna also told the Woman\u2019s Hour programme that going for a naked walk shouldn\u2019t be the first thing you attempt to do. You need to feel relaxed and confident with your actions first \u2013 or what we sometimes say is \u2018comfortable in your own skin\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, she says we need to get to feel that nakedness is normal. I suppose we were all born naked and it\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. And, in the UK at least, it\u2019s generally not against the law to be naked in public."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmm, I\u2019m still not convinced, but according to Donna Price, this freedom of expression is quite well received when she\u2019s out walking. Here she is speaking on the BBC\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme again\u2026"},{"author":"Donna Price, volunteer, British Naturism","text":"A majority of the responses that you actually encounter, if you do encounter the public, the general public, are actually very encouraging. They're not shock, horror majority of the time, I can guarantee that. A lot of people say just 'good morning' and carry on, some of them actually say 'gosh, you're braver than I am\u2019 if it\u2019s a bit chilly. A lot of them just say, ' I really wish I could do that' and usually we just say 'you can!'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, the people Donna encounters \u2013 or meets \u2013 seem to support what she\u2019 s doing. She says it's not shock, horror \u2013 this is usually said as an informal way of actually saying something is not surprising, not shocking!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, shock, horror, Neil, I won\u2019t be taking my clothes off anytime soon \u2013 it\u2019s too cold anyway and I don\u2019t want to be bitten by all those bugs you get in the countryside. But it\u2019s good to hear that people are open-minded to the idea."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, good luck to anyone who wants to give it a try and well done to those brave people who took part in the world\u2019s biggest skinny dip \u2013 a mass naked swim. Earlier, Georgina, you asked me how many people took part in the event in Ireland in 2018."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I did and you said?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said about 250 people went for a dip. Was I right?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"No, Neil. According to Guinness World Records, 2,505 women took part in the largest charity skinny dip in Wicklow in Ireland."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, well done to them and skinny dipping was one of the items of vocabulary we discussed today. This is an informal way of describing the act of swimming naked."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"We\u2019ve also been discussing naturists - people who think not wearing clothes outdoors is a healthy way to live, and it makes them feel good. The act of doing this is called naturism ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And when you advocate something, like naturism for example, you publicly support it."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Being at one with nature means having a connection with the natural world that makes you feel good. And liberation means being freed from something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And when we say \u2018 shock, horror !\u2019 we actually mean the opposite and mean something in not shocking or surprising \u2013 we\u2019re being sarcastic, I guess."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It\u2019s not like you to be sarcastic Neil! But shock, horror \u2013 we\u2019re out of time now. We only get 6 minutes and that\u2019s the naked truth! Thanks for listening and goodbye."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye."}],"authors":["Georgina","Neil","Donna Price, volunteer, British
