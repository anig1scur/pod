Are you implying I\u2019m always late?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, punctuality \u2013 I mean being on time \u2013 is not your strong point."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"But I do always turn up and I never miss the programme \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to be early Neil and then wait around for you!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm \u2013 people\u2019s attitude to being on time certainly varies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing in this programme: how important is punctuality? Anyway, Catherine, as you\u2019re here on time, you\u2019re not going to miss our quiz question!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Oh no, I certainly don\u2019t want to miss out on that. So what is it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well in 2011, Researchers said that an atomic clock at the UK's National Physical Laboratory would have the best long-term accuracy of any in the world. But how many years would it take, approximately, for it to lose or gain a second? Is it..."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Umm well now, atomic clocks are very accurate, but 138 million years is a bit extreme, so I\u2019ll say b) 138,000 years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Catherine, we\u2019ll find out the answer before the end of the programme - which has to be six minutes long! So, let\u2019s talk more about people\u2019s timekeeping \u2013 that\u2019s their ability to do things on time."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Now, I know Neil doesn\u2019t like to be late \u2013 he thinks it\u2019s rude. But I might be late because the traffic was bad, or I had extra things to do. And I know most appointments we make start late!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Catherine, it sounds like you might be a time bender . It\u2019s something author Grace Pacie talked about on BBC Woman\u2019s Hour programme. Let\u2019s hear her definition of a time bender."},{"author":"Grace Pacie","text":"Well [Jenny], a time bender is actually somebody we all know very well. They are the people who arrive last at any meeting or class, or the mums whose children have to run into school at the last minute. They\u2019re the people who don\u2019t want to be late but they have a strange resistance to being early [like you] and they don\u2019t allow enough time."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK, so I might be a time bender \u2013 someone who doesn\u2019t allow enough time to get somewhere \u2013 but, of course, I always think I will have enough time!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"One thing that is guaranteed is you\u2019ll never be early. You have a resistance to \u2013 you fight against or are opposed to - being on time. Isn\u2019t it best to leave home just a little bit earlier?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, Neil, it\u2019s about deadlines \u2013 you know, a fixed time when something must be completed by. If a deadline really matters, I\u2019ll make it, but for less important things, it\u2019s not worth getting too stressed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Umm if you say so, Catherine. Being late makes me anxious, which is why I always arrive early. But therapist Philippa Perry might be able to explain your more relaxed attitude to timekeeping. She also spoke about this on the BBC\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme. See if you can hear what her reasons are."},{"author":"Philippa Perry","text":"Underlying it all, there is this fear of being early, and the fear could be a fear of being conspicuous , a fear of standing out in a strange place, having no one to talk to, feeling a bit alone and awkward \u2026 the other reason people are always late is\u2026 that all the traffic lights will be green, and they generally sort of stretch the time somehow in their minds and just think there\u2019s time to do absolutely everything they\u2019ve packed in."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, she thinks being late is to do with social awkwardness \u2013 if you arrive too soon you feel awkward \u2013 that\u2019s uncomfortable or nervous, waiting for others to arrive."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"There\u2019s also the fear of being conspicuous \u2013 easily noticed or standing out in a crowd. It\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling, but that\u2019s not why I might be late. It\u2019s the other reason Philippa Perry mentioned. I just think there\u2019s time to pack everything in! But if it makes you happy, I will try to be on time next time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, according to experts on the Woman\u2019s Hour programme, you shouldn\u2019t \u2018try\u2019 to be on time, you should \u2018decide\u2019 to be on time."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK, Neil! But before we run out of time, why don\u2019t you tell me if I had the right answer to the quiz. Was I correct?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you how many years it would take, approximately, for the UK's National Physical Laboratory\u2019s atomic clock to lose or gain a second? Is it... a) 138 years, b) 138,000 years, or c) 138 million years?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And I said b) 138,000 years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you are wrong! You are too early for a change \u2013 the answer is c) 138 million years. Maybe I should buy you an atomic watch, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Ha ha. Right, let\u2019s not waste any more time \u2013 here\u2019s a recap of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed today, starting with punctuality . This is about doing something at an agreed time and being on time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When we talk about someone\u2019s timekeeping , we mean their ability to achieve things on time."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And we heard about time benders \u2013 not really people who bend time \u2013 but people who are always late because they don\u2019t allow enough time to get somewhere."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like you, Catherine, maybe? It\u2019s because you have a resistance to being on time \u2013 you are against being on time, you fight against it."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That\u2019s because I hate deadlines - fixed times when things must be completed by. And some people also feel conspicuous , easily noticed, and they feel awkward -uncomfortable or nervous."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks for joining us, and don\u2019t forget to check out all our other programmes on our website \u2013 at bblearningenglish.com.
