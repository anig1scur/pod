British company Vertical Future has been working on this problem by developing indoor farming methods in partnership with Nasa."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here\u2019s their Head of Research, Jen Bromley, explaining the process to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain."},{"author":"Jen Bromley","text":"Basically we use LED lighting and we use LED lights that are tuned to a specific wavelength. So, if you image what the rainbow looks like, the reason a plant looks green is because it\u2019s not using all the green light \u2013 it actually reflects a lot of that back. So the reason why it looks pink in here is because we\u2019re actually only using red light and blue light to grow the plants, and that essentially tailors the light diet so that the plants look black when you look at them because they\u2019re not reflecting any light \u2013 they\u2019re being super-efficient, they\u2019re using up every photon that hits them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The lack of natural light in space means that plants are grown using LED lights \u2013 LED is an abbreviation of \u2018light emitting diode\u2019 -  an electronic device that lights up when electricity is passed through it."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"On Earth plants look green because they reflect back any light travelling at a certain wavelength - the distance between two waves of light which make things appear to us in the various colours of the rainbow."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But when scientists control the wavelengths being fed, plants are able to absorb every photon \u2013 particle of light energy, making them appear black."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Each particle of light that hits the leaves is absorbed and through photosynthesis is converted into plant food. Nasa found that different colour combinations, or light recipes, can change a plant's shape, size and even flavour."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the lack of natural light isn\u2019t the biggest obstacle to growing food in space. Here\u2019s Gioia Massa, chief plant scientist at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, to explain."},{"author":"Gioia\u00a0Massa","text":"Gioia Massa Microgravity is really challenging but plants are amazing! They can adapt to so many different environments \u2013 we call this plasticity because they can turn on or off their genes to really adapt to all sorts of conditions and that\u2019s why you see plants growing in different areas on Earth - the same type of plant may look very different because it\u2019s adapting to the environment in that specific location."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"On Earth, plants use gravity to position themselves \u2013 shoots grow up, roots grow down. But this doesn\u2019t apply in space because of microgravity - the weaker pull of gravity making things float and seem weightless."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Plants can only survive in these conditions due to their plasticity \u2013 the ability of living organisms to adapt and cope with changes in the environment by changing their biological structure."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Plants adapt themselves to being in space by manipulating their genes - chemicals and DNA in the cells of plants and animals which control their development and behaviour."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the low-gravity atmosphere of space, plants become stressed but they adapt genetically."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And as a result they\u2019re stronger and more resilient to other, less stressful events when they return home to Earth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like those bottles of red wine orbiting Earth as we speak.
