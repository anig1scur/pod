This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Rob, what\u2019s the best job you\u2019ve ever had?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Err well, this one, of course! It\u2019s very creative, with lots of variety."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, any other reasons?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well yes \u2013 it\u2019s a permanent job - a staff job - with regular income and a pension."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, these things can be important, but have you ever been freelance \u2013 by that I mean, working for yourself and selling your skills and services to different businesses?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I worked as a paperboy once \u2013 delivering newspapers. But not really \u2013 it\u2019s a risky way to earn an income."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It can be Rob. But many people choose to, or have to work as a freelancer to survive. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about in this programme. But let\u2019s start with a question for you, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"This is about job titles \u2013 back in the 19th Century, what kind of job was a drummer? Were they\u2026"},{"author":"drums up","text":"a) someone who played the drums? b) a travelling salesman?, or, c) a music publicist \u2013 who  \u2013 meaning encourages, support for a band?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it\u2019s got to be someone who plays the drums \u2013 that\u2019s my kind of job."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, Rob, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. But let\u2019s talk more about work now. Long gone are the days of a job for life, where you spent your adult life working your way up the career ladder at the same company."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, that\u2019s right. We work in many different ways now because the needs of businesses change frequently and it needs to be agile \u2013 changing the size and type of work force in order to meet demand."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, people need to adapt and some choose to work for themselves, offering their skills to different businesses as and when they are needed. But it can also be a lifestyle choice, as we\u2019re about to find out."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, some people have chosen to become self-employed \u2013 working for themselves - but also, because of the recent coronavirus pandemic, some people have been forced into this situation. Let\u2019s hear from Carla Barker, who set up her own business after giving up her regular job. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme You and Yours how she felt\u2026"},{"author":"Carla Barker","text":"You know the idea of giving up a solid, permanent, full-time, paid, comfortable, role is a bit petrifying \u2026 It is super-scary because \u2026 you then have that fear of \u2018oh my goodness can we do this\u2019? You also have things creeping in that say you know like self-sabotage \u2013 are you good enough to do this? Are people going to want to take me on as a business?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, Carla decided to go it alone \u2013 an informal way of saying work for herself. She described giving up a full-time job as petrifying \u2013 so frightening you can\u2019t speak or move. She may have been exaggerating slightly but she also said it was \u2018super-scary\u2019!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I guess working for yourself must be scary as you\u2019re solely responsible for your own success. It\u2019s no surprise Carla had feelings of self-sabotage \u2013 having doubts and fears that stopped her achieving something."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Luckily, she persisted and things went well. And many other people who have become self-employed or freelance have overcome the fear and discovered the benefits."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Like Fiona Thomas, who\u2019s the author of a book called \u2018Ditch the 9 to 5 and be your Own Boss\u2019. She also spoke to the BBC\u2019s You and Yours programme and explained why she gave up the 9 to 5 \u2013 the regular, full-time staff job \u2013 and how it helped her\u2026"},{"author":"Fiona Thomas, Author","text":"A kind of combination of wanting some creative fulfilment from a job, compared to the job that I was in before, which was very much customer based and working face-to-face in hospitality. But I also wanted the flexibility to accommodate my mental health because I suffer from depression and anxiety and I found working in a rigid schedule and being in front of a lot of people all the time really exacerbated a lot of my symptoms. And I also wanted the financial freedom to be able to, over time, increase my income without just having to wait on being promoted or getting a pay rise in traditional employment."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, working for herself gave Fiona a good feeling that she achieved something she wanted to do \u2013 it gave her creative fulfilment . It also meant she could work more flexibly and that helped her with her mental health because she didn\u2019t have to follow a fixed rota of tasks."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And it gave her financial freedom \u2013 meaning the money she earned was not controlled by someone else, and she didn\u2019t have to wait for someone else to give her a pay rise. Of course, that can be risky too."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Let\u2019s get back to my quiz question now, Rob. Earlier I asked you if you knew what job a drummer used to do back in the 19th Century?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And obviously, a drummer plays the drums!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, you are sort of right but a drummer also used to be an informal way of describing a travelling salesperson \u2013 because their job was to drum up business for a company \u2013 meaning they tried to increase sales."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ahh very interesting, although I know which drummer I would rather be \u2013 a freelance drummer in a rock band!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And freelance is one of the words we\u2019ve mentioned today. To freelance means to work for yourself, selling your skills or services to different businesses."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Becoming self-employed can be petrifying \u2013 frightening, so you can\u2019t speak or move. And starting out on your own can lead to self-sabotage \u2013 having doubts and fears that stop you achieving something."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But it can also give you fulfilment \u2013 a good feeling of achieving something for yourself."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And having financial freedom means being able to control how you earn and use your money."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s it for this programme.
