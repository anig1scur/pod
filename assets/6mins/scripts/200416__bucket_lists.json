So every time I can have a chance to step out of my comfort zone, a little piece of that fear of the unknown is removed and replaced with a little piece of empowerment , and by continuously doing that, the size of my fear bubble has gotten smaller."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Annette feels that choosing adventurous goals for her bucket list helps her step outside her comfort zone \u2013 the situations where she feels safe and comfortable but where her ability and determination are not really being tested."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Moving out of her comfort zone has helped Annette replace her feelings of fear with feelings of empowerment \u2013 the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling her life."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, that all sounds pretty good to me. But not everyone is convinced that bucket lists can really help people like Annette in the long run. Here\u2019s clinical psychologist Linda Blair to explain why:"},{"author":"Linda Blair, clinical psychologist","text":"I\u2019m not really in favour of bucket lists. There are a couple of reasons. Most of all, you\u2019re kind of fooling yourself with a bucket list. We fear death, more than I think we fear anything else in our existence, because we can\u2019t predict it, and because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like because nobody comes back and tells us. And when you create a bucket list \u2013 something to do before you \u2018kick the bucket\u2019 ,the idea that you\u2019re giving yourself is that you can somehow control when and what death is going to be all about. We only make sense of our lives at the end of it. A bucket list takes you away from the chance to be spontaneous and I think it\u2019s so delicious to be able to say, \u2018that\u2019s an opportunity? \u2013 oh, I\u2019ll do that!\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Linda thinks some people use bucket lists as a coping strategy to try to control something uncontrollable \u2013 death. In this way they are fooling - or deceiving - themselves - trying to make themselves believe something they know is not really true."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And by having a checklist of adventures to tick off before they die, people might lose the chance to be spontaneous \u2013 to act in a natural and impulsive way without planning."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Linda also uses an unusual expression which gave \u2018bucket list\u2019 its name in the first place. A bucket list is all the things you want to do before you \u2018 kick the bucket\u2019 \u2013 an informal way of saying, \u2018die\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2018 Kick the bucket\u2019 is an old English expression that was even used by Shakespeare. It refers to kicking the bucket away from under the feet of a hanging man, leaving him to drop to his death."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, anyway, I hope I don\u2019t kick the bucket before I\u2019ve had a chance to tell you the correct answer to today\u2019s quiz. Remember, I asked you which personal goal was most often included in bucket lists?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said, a) swimming with dolphins"},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the actual answer was c) seeing the northern lights"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, maybe we could combine the two in a single trip\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And then get a tattoo!
