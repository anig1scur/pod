This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be looking at an unusual food called microalgae and asking whether eating algae might be better for our health and the health of the planet. And of course, we\u2019ll be looking at some of the related vocabulary along the way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yuck! I\u2019m not sure about eating algae, Neil! I mean, what\u2019s the strangest thing you\u2019ve ever eaten?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I once tried fried stick insect in Thailand\u2026 and I\u2019ve had ants, as well, that were from Colombia."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah, OK, yeah \u2013 both fairly strange for us here in the UK. But what about pond scum , Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Pond scum? Pond scum is the slang name for microalgae - green plant organisms , such as spirulina, which grow in water-like ponds and look a bit slimy or scummy before being dried. Here, we\u2019re talking about edible algae, meaning it\u2019s OK to eat."},{"author":"Sam","text":"More than OK, in fact \u2013 these types of food algae are actually good for your body! Microalgae like spirulina and chlorella are packed full of proteins, vitamins and antioxidants. Because they are so healthy, they\u2019re having a moment right now, meaning they are becoming more well-known and popular."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, microalgae is trending just now and for good reasons, which we\u2019ll find out about later. But first, let me ask you our quiz question. What do the following three things have in common: oceans, snow and my garden patio? Is it\u2026 a) They are all good places to relax b) They are all very cold c) They are all places where microalgae grow"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I know that oceans and snow are made up of water\u2026 but your garden patio? Did your barbeque get rained off again, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, not quite, Sam! Well, hopefully you\u2019ll know by the end of the programme. Now, I mentioned before that microalgae is sometimes called a superfood - a type of food which is essentially full of healthy vitamins, minerals and nutrients. But microalgae is not the first superfood to become popular."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s right. In the early 2010s, many juice bars started popping up in places around the world selling green smoothies - energy drinks made by blending healthy ingredients like kale, chard and spinach. The recent trend for microalgae and spirulina has been promoted in part by big drinks companies wanting to sell the latest brightly coloured smoothies."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And more and more, spirulina is also being used as a cooking ingredient \u2013 in hot dogs and meatballs \u2013 and as a protein-rich substitute for eggs in pasta and mayonnaise."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But as well as all these health benefits, there\u2019s another advantage to microalgae superfoods - one that could potentially benefit the whole planet. BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme asked Professor Alison Smith, Head of Plant Sciences at Cambridge University, to explain:"},{"author":"Alison Smith","text":"As the population of the world increases and the land that\u2019s available for agriculture is becoming stretched , there\u2019s an interest in trying to increase productivity by other means\u2026so sustainable intensification of agriculture is one way\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So food security is an issue - making sure enough nutritionally-rich food is produced to feed the growing world population. Alison Smith says the amount of agricultural land available for growing food is becoming stretched, meaning there are not enough resources, in this case farm land, to meet everyone\u2019s needs."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, and she mentions that one possible solution is sustainable intensification of agriculture - which means increasing food production in ways which don\u2019t damage the environment or use new land."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we know that microalgae are superfoods, nutritionally rich in vitamins and protein, but how do they help reduce the need for agricultural land? Alison Smith explains:"},{"author":"Alison Smith","text":"\u2026they can be grown in all sorts of locations \u2013 in water, in oceans, in ponds, lakes and so on, even on your patio and on snow\u2026 so one of the possibilities is to produce these organisms in cities and towns because they don\u2019t need the open landscape to be grown."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think I\u2019ve spotted the answer to your quiz question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes? I asked what oceans, snow and my patio have in common. a) They are all good places to relax b) They are all very cold c) They are all places where microalgae grows"},{"author":"Sam","text":"The answer is c ) - places where microalgae can grow! What an amazing plant! I think I\u2019m going to stop calling it pond scum and use the correct scientific name Prof Smith mentioned, organisms."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Today\u2019s programme was all about microalgae like spirulina, a green, edible food algae which some people call pond scum, although scientifically speaking it\u2019s an organism , meaning an animal or plant life form."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, and this plant life form is also called a superfood , because it\u2019s especially rich in vitamins, minerals and nutrients which promote good health."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Superfoods are having a moment right now, meaning they\u2019re becoming more popular or trending because they\u2019re so healthy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And another benefit of microalgae is that it grows almost anywhere. So it doesn\u2019t use much agricultural land, which is becoming stretched , meaning there\u2019s not enough of it to meet the world\u2019s food needs. Sustainable intensification is another possible solution to this problem, because it is a way of increasing food production without harming the environment or using new land.
