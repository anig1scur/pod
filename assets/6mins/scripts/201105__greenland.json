Locked inside is enough water to raise sea levels by 6 metres."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But global heating and melting polar ice has many scientists asking whether it\u2019s now too late to stop.

Now, Georgina, you mentioned record levels of ice melt in the North Pole but the scale is hard to take in. The amounts are so big they\u2019re measured in gigatonnes \u2013 that\u2019s a billion metric tonnes."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Imagine a giant ice cube 1 kilometre by 1 kilometre by 1 kilometre."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So my quiz question is this: how many gigatonnes of ice are now melting into the ocean every year? Is it: a) 450 gigatonnes?, b) 500 gigatonnes?, or c) 550 gigatonnes?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I\u2019ll take a guess at b) 500 gigatonnes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out later. Now, glaciologist Michalea King has been monitoring the melting of Arctic ice by satellite. Here she is answering a question from BBC World Service programme, Science in Action, on whether the destruction of the ice sheet is now unavoidable:"},{"author":"Michalea King","text":"If we were to say\u2026 define a tipping point as a shift from one stable dynamic state to another, this certainly meets that criteria, because we\u2019re seeing now that the ice sheet was more or less in balance prior to 2000 where the amount of ice being drained from the glaciers was approximately equal to what we are gaining on the surface via snow every year."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ice is made from snow falling on Greenland\u2019s glaciers - large, slow-moving masses of ice. At the same time though, ice is also lost through melting."},{"author":"Neil","text":"These two processes of making and melting ice kept the ice level in balance - having different parts or elements arranged in the correct proportions. Essentially the melting ice was replaced by newly frozen ice."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But now, the glaciers are shrinking faster than new ice is being accumulated and the situation may have reached a tipping point - the time at which a change or an effect cannot be stopped."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, does this mean that global heating and ice melting are now running automatically, separate from the amount of greenhouse gases humans are pumping into the atmosphere? And does that mean should just give up on the planet?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In fact the situation is far from simple, as Michalea King explains here to BBC World Service programme, Science in Action :"},{"author":"Michalea King","text":"We can definitely control the rate of mass loss, so it\u2019s definitely not a \u2018throw your hands up\u2019 and just not do anything about it \u2013 give up on the ice sheet kind of situation \u2013 that\u2019s certainly not the message I want to send \u2013 but it does seem likely that we will continue to lose mass\u2026 but of course, a slow rate of mass loss is highly preferred to large annual losses every year."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Michalea thinks that changes in human activity can still slow the rate \u2013 or speed at which something happens, in this case the speed of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet melting."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"She\u2019s convinced it\u2019s not too late for collective action to save the planet, so it\u2019s not yet time to throw your hands up \u2013 an idiom meaning to show frustration and despair when a situation becomes so bad that you give up or submit."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s a positive message but one which calls for everyone to do what they can before it really is too late."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Because the rate of ice melt is still increasing, right, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 in fact, that was my quiz question, Georgina \u2013 do you remember?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, you asked me how many gigatonnes of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet are now melting every year. I said b) 500 gigatonnes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you were\u2026correct! In fact some of these giant ice cubes are like small towns, almost a kilometre tall!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So there\u2019s still work to be done."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme we\u2019ve been looking at the rate \u2013 or speed \u2013 of ice melt in Greenland\u2019s ice sheet - the thick layer of ice covering a large area of the Arctic."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Previously, the melting ice was replaced by newly formed ice on glaciers \u2013 large masses of slow-moving ice. This kept the Arctic in balance \u2013 having different elements arranged in proportion."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the effects of global heating have brought us close to a point of no return, called a tipping point - the time at which a change or an effect cannot be stopped."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The situation is serious but there\u2019s still time to take action and not simply throw your hands up \u2013 show frustration and despair when you want to give up."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme, but if you want to find out more about climate change and Greenland\u2019s ice sheets, search BBC\u2019s Science in Action website."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, remember to join us again soon at 6 Minute English.
