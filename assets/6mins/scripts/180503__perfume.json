I'm Neil."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I'm Dan."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we going to hear from someone who smells smells for a living. Although these are very expensive smells - smells that we wear deliberately to make us smell good."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ah, you mean scents and perfumes?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes and perfumes are big business. And that is the topic of our quiz in this programme. How much is the perfume industry in the UK worth each year?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I don't nose this \u2013 smell, nose - this is just a guess, but I\u2019ll say \u00a3970 million."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019ll let you know the answer a little later in the programme. Now let\u2019s hear from Roja Dove, who is a perfumer. He designs and creates very exclusive and very expensive perfumes. In a recent BBC video he talked about the power of smells. What does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?"},{"author":"Roja Dove","text":"\u2026who we are as a personality and the type of smells we like. When we are born, the part of our brain which deals with smell is empty so we learn our response to smell. And then when we smell that odorant again it\u2019s like a trigger or a catalyst that will revive the original associational memory."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Dan, what does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Between our personality and the kind of smells we like. The point he is making is that the smells we experience when we are very young can have a big psychological impact on us even later in life."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I know that feeling \u2013 smell is a very powerful sense. The smell of something can take you right back in time and fill you with emotions."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly. For example, when I walk through the perfume area of a department store I always feel a bit nostalgic because I can smell the perfume my mum first girlfriend used to wear. It\u2019s a powerful sensation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dove used particular words and expression to describe this, didn\u2019t he?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, first he used the word odorant to describe the smell. It\u2019s not really a common word. We use it more frequently as part of the word de odorant , which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies. These odorants , he said, can act as the trigger or catalyst for these memories. Both the nouns trigger and catalyst refer to something that causes a particular response. So a particular smell can be a trigger or catalyst for a particular emotion."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As well as being a trigger for memories, smells can, according to Dove, say a lot about your personality. Here he is again talking about the kind of scent to wear if you want to give a particular impression. What does he say these scents make you appear very strong at?"},{"author":"Roja Dove","text":"The idea of the message you give off with scent I think can\u2019t be underestimated. My suggestion would be to look for very, very woody, mossy, structured scents called Chypres if the message you want to put across is that you are someone not to be messed with , very, very strong in business, or whatever \u2013 just not to be messed with ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So what do the scents he described make you seem strong at?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Business, they can make you seem very, very strong in business."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Mmm, and how does he explain that?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, he says that some scents give off a particular message. The phrasal verb give off is often used to describe something that we broadcast about ourselves without saying anything. So he\u2019s saying that our scent, our perfume, can give off a message about the kind of person we are and that we shouldn\u2019t underestimate that. If you underestimate something you don\u2019t give it as much importance as it should have, you don\u2019t take it seriously enough."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He then goes on to talk about the particular scent that gives off the impression of being very strong in business."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, it\u2019s a woody, mossy scent which suggests that you are not someone to be messed with ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not to be messed with ?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes \u2013 someone to be taken seriously, someone who is serious who you don\u2019t want to try and trick."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right and talking of tricking \u2013 did we trick you with the quiz? I asked - What was the value of the perfume industry in the UK?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I said it was \u00a3970 million."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And it was actually option c), which was an incredible \u00a31.3 billion."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Wow! That is a lot of smelly stuff."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It is indeed! Right, now, time for vocabulary recap. What words and expressions did we have today?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, first we had odorant \u2013 an unusual word for something that smells."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Then two words with a very similar meaning: a trigger and a catalyst \u2013 both of which refer to something that can make something else happen. In this case it was a particular smell making us remember something from the past. So scents can sends us to the past. But they can also say something about our personality."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, they can send unspoken information -  or give off messages. And these messages should not be underestimated . If you do underestimate the importance of smell, it means that you don\u2019t take those messages seriously."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally we heard the phrase to mess with someone . To mess with someone means that you don\u2019t take them seriously, you cause them trouble and that may cause you trouble."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to mess with you! Judging by the messages you\u2019re giving off ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah you mean my aftershave? Makes me seem powerful?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I was thinking more of the egg sandwich you had for lunch. I really wouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of that."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah! On that note, I think it\u2019s time to end the programme. For more, find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com!
