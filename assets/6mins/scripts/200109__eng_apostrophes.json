Do you get upset, annoyed or angry if you see punctuation being used incorrectly \u2013 particularly apostrophes?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it depends. Usually I\u2019m pretty chilled out about it, but sometimes, just sometimes it really winds me up. For example, if I see a sign for taxis at a train station and it says taxi \u2013 apostrophe - s \u2013 aargh! Why \u2013 why? The apostrophe is not used to show there is more than one, it\u2019s used to show there is a missing letter or that the word is a possessive \u2013 it\u2019s just wrong! So that does kind of make my blood boil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, when you say you\u2019re pretty chilled about it you mean\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, I\u2019m not chilled at all. But maybe I wish I were."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, we\u2019re going to be taking a look at reactions to the use and abuse of apostrophes in this programme. But first, a question. The word \u2018apostrophe\u2019 itself \u2013 which language does it come from? Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Arabic, so it\u2019s a toss-up between Latin and Greek. I\u2019m going to say Greek."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re correct at the end of the programme. The apostrophe, it is true to say, is often misused. It\u2019s put where it shouldn\u2019t be and not used where it should be. Is it important, though? Does it matter? After all, in spoken English there is no difference between \u2018it\u2019s\u2019 with an apostrophe and \u2018its\u2019 without. \u2018Your\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re\u2019 \u2013 short for \u2018you are\u2019 sound the same. So what\u2019s the problem in written English?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"In many cases there isn\u2019t a problem at all. There would be very little confusion. But I don\u2019t think that means we should just ignore the correct way to use them. Sometimes it can be very important to make clear if it\u2019s a singular or plural or possessive. Another important thing to remember is that in CVs and job applications a good standard of spelling and punctuation is expected. Get it wrong and you could miss out on a good opportunity."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"There is one group that has tried for nearly 20 years to keep others to these high standards - The Apostrophe Protection Society. They have publicly pointed out incorrect use in public signs and communications \u2013 a tactic that has not always been welcome or successful. But like the apostrophe itself, the group is in danger. Here\u2019s a BBC news report on the subject."},{"author":"Duncan Kennedy, BBC reporter","text":"They linger above our letters, they wander around the endings of our words, but apostrophes, it seems, are an endangered species. The Apostrophe Protection Society \u2013 yes there really is one \u2013 says their future is, well, up in the air ."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"How does he describe apostrophes?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Using metaphorical, poetic language, he says they linger above our letters. To linger is a verb usually used to describe someone or something staying somewhere before finally leaving."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, we have apostrophes lingering above our letters and also he said they wander around the ending of words."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, also a metaphorical use. To wander means to walk slowly around without any real purpose or urgency."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And he went on to say that the future of the apostrophe is up in the air . When something is up in the air , it means its future is not certain, it\u2019s not guaranteed. So if, for example, your holiday plans are up in the air , it means that there is some kind of problem and you might not be going on holiday after all. The person who founded The Apostrophe Protection Society is John Edwards. Now 96 years old he has decided to give it up. Partly because of his age, but also because he thinks that due to the impact of texting and social media he has lost the battle against bad punctuation. So why has it come to this? Here he is explaining why he thinks people aren\u2019t bothered about using correct punctuation."},{"author":"John Edwards","text":"I think it\u2019s a mixture of ignorance and laziness. They\u2019re too ignorant to know where it goes, they\u2019re too lazy to learn so they just don\u2019t bother. The barbarians have won."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So what\u2019s his reason?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"He blames ignorance and laziness. Ignorance is a lack of knowledge or understanding of something. So people don\u2019t know the rules and are too lazy to learn them, according to Edwards."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Quite strong views there!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, and you thought I was a pedant ! He actually goes further to say that the barbarians have won. Barbarian is a historical word for people who weren\u2019t part of so-called civilized society. They were seen as violent and aggressive, primitive and uncivilized."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So it\u2019s not a compliment then?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh no!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Right, before we review today\u2019s vocabulary, let\u2019s have the answer to today\u2019s quiz. Which language does the word apostrophe come from? What did you say?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I went for Greek."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Congratulations to you and anyone else who got that right. Greek is the right answer. Now let\u2019s remind ourselves of today\u2019s vocabulary. First, what\u2019s a pedant , Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"A pedant is someone who corrects other people\u2019s small mistakes \u2013 particularly in grammar and punctuation \u2013 but it\u2019s not the same as an English teacher! A pedant will correct native speakers\u2019 mistakes too, and not in the classroom."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"To linger means to stay somewhere for longer."},{"author":"Rob","text":"To wander is to walk around without a real purpose or intention to get somewhere quickly."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"If your plans are up in the air , it means they are at risk and might not happen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ignorance is the state of not knowing something that should be known."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And finally, a barbarian is a word for a primitive and uncivilized person. Right, we can\u2019t linger in this studio as our six minutes are up.
