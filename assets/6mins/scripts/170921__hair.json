This meant we didn\u2019t get so hot and tired \u2013 we could run faster and for longer \u2013 and catch more animals to eat! Neil That sounds like a good theory. But do you have a theory on how many hair follicles the human body has today?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"What\u2019s a hair follicle?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A hair follicle is the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.

Neil Hair today, gone tomorrow?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Bad joke, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sorry! It\u2019s true that hair on your head shows signs of aging \u2013 but this isn\u2019t true of all human hair. Let\u2019s listen to Ralf Paus, a leading hair loss researcher, talking about this. INSERT Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher The eyebrows get stronger usually in aging men, the hairs in your nose and in your ears get stronger \u2013 and what a miracle of nature that an organ \u2013 when the entire body is aging actually grows stronger. So we may even be able to learn from hair follicles how not to age."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Hmm. I\u2019m not sure I would swap a good head of hair for thick eyebrows and nose hair. How about you, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I agree! But let\u2019s hear more from Ralf Paus about why some hair gets stronger as you get older."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher The hair follicle apparently knows some tricks that the other organs don\u2019t know. So it\u2019s continuously regenerating itself. It goes through a so-called hair cycle and part of that we know pretty well \u2013 and that is, these stem cells that it uses to regenerate cells."},{"author":"Tim","text":"So a hair follicle can regenerate cells \u2013 or grow new cells to replace old or damaged ones. But if that\u2019s only true for eyebrows, nose and ear hair, I am not that impressed! I want hairs on my head to be able to regenerate!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"The important thing here is that these cells in the hair follicle may help scientists discover a way to stop other organs of the body aging\u2026 OK, I\u2019m now going to reveal how many hair follicles on average we have on our bodies. The answer is\u2026 5 million."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Oh. So not 50 million then."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Don\u2019t worry, Tim! It was a tricky question! Now let\u2019s go over the words we learned today."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u2018Hair-raising\u2019 means scary often in an exciting way.

Is your grandpa actually bald, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No \u2013 he has a fine head of hair. Now, if you are a certain age, it means you are no longer young. For example\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cAll the people at the party were of a certain age\u2026\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"How many of them had facial hair, Tim? That\u2019s our next word, and \u2018facial\u2019 means to do with the face."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cNone of the people at the party had facial hair.\u201d There\u2019s your answer!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s unusual, Tim. Lots of men have beards these days. OK \u2013 our final word for today is \u2018regenerate\u2019 which means to grow again.
