I\u2019m Neil. Today we\u2019re talking about jobs."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I\u2019m Dan. And specifically, we\u2019re looking at the trend for having more than one job\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes. On that note \u2013 Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Do you remember your answer?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That doesn\u2019t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It\u2019s one reason why more and more people have what we call portfolio careers these days \u2013 so they can do a bit of everything."},{"author":"Dan","text":"A portfolio , as a noun, means 'a case for carrying large pictures \u2013 or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things \u2013 in this case, careers."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a portfolio career."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Sounds like a good combination. First, let\u2019s do today\u2019s question \u2013 it\u2019s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as\u2026 bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It can\u2019t be spies, can it? So I\u2019m going to guess guards. C."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Great, well let\u2019s find out at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, the portfolio career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don\u2019t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Which specific example of a portfolio career does she mention?"},{"author":"INSERT","text":"INSERT Emily Wapnick, Author More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs - and it\u2019s not just to make ends meet . A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They\u2019ve got, you know,  three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they\u2019re a serial entrepreneur . Or they\u2019ve got a career in two different areas. There\u2019s a guy that I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier \u2013 he makes violins - and he\u2019s very successful in both."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who\u2019s both a psychotherapist and a luthier \u2013 someone who makes violins."},{"author":"Dan","text":"She says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet \u2013 in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression \u2013 a serial entrepreneur \u2013 what\u2019s that exactly?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses \u2013 and the use of serial here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity \u2013 such as a serial killer or serial murderer ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Not the kind of portfolio career I had in mind. A serial entrepreneur , on the other hand, starts and runs business after business."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast \u2013 it\u2019s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it\u2019s wise to add another string to your bow ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"A great phrase, which really just means 'to learn new skills you can use in the future'. I\u2019d like to learn Japanese \u2013 that would add another string to my bow ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So desu, ne? But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Here\u2019s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"INSERT Charles Handy, writer 80% of the people in corporate jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you\u2019re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they\u2019re not making an awful lot of money. It\u2019s a balancing job really, you\u2019re free but you\u2019re poor. Or you\u2019re slaved but you\u2019re richer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sounds like a difficult choice \u2013 be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019d rather be poor and free, thank you very much."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, let\u2019s explain a term he used \u2013 a corporate job. What does corporate mean?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Quite literally, it\u2019s the adjective from the term corporation - a corporate job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation \u2013 usually well paid, and with certain benefits."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Could we say James Bond has a corporate career?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today\u2019s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said the Bonds were guards."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years\u2026 the spying game came much later!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed! Let\u2019s spy today\u2019s words once more. We had portfolio \u2013 which can be used in different ways. There\u2019s a portfolio career, as well as the original meaning of a portfolio of art. Any others?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, people talk about a portfolio of investments \u2013 when you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Talking of money, we had to make ends meet . People often work a number of different part-time jobs to make ends meet \u2013 to make enough money to live on."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a serial entrepreneur . Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019d love to start a business\u2026 First, I need to learn a new skill - add another string to my bow and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I\u2019ll run a yoga business."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not for me though, I prefer the corporate life \u2013 a secure job in a big corporation!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"OK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Alright. Dan And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And we are on social media of course.
