Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Great, but first it\u2019s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we\u2019ve been using: 'clickbait' and ' rage bait '. Both contain the word, 'bait', but what is its actual meaning? Is bait:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I am fairly confident that it is b) \u2013 food put on a hook."},{"author":"Phil","text":"OK. Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here\u2019s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here\u2019s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:"},{"author":"Andrea Jones","text":"The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything\u2026 some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people."},{"author":"Megan Lawton","text":"Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? [\u2026]"},{"author":"Andrea Jones","text":"As a marketer, I'm always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content\u2026 When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what's in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you\u2019ll improve."},{"author":"Phil","text":"It doesn\u2019t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage \u2013 to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That\u2019s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative , meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage."},{"author":"Beth","text":"So, it\u2019s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you\u2019re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service\u2019s, Business Daily:"},{"author":"Dr William Brady","text":"If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, \u2018Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?\u2019 Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that's the content we\u2019ll pay more attention to. In turn that's the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Influencers want more eyeballs on their content \u2013 more people to view their website or social media posts \u2013 and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases \u2013 feelings \u2013 which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention."},{"author":"Phil","text":"So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Phil, let\u2019s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what 'bait' is."},{"author":"Phil","text":"I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn\u2019t that what you said, Beth?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"It is, yes."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Right again! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait , social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The structure, t he more\u2026 the more\u2026 describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too."},{"author":"Phil","text":"To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The adjective, manipulative , describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Phil","Beth","Andrea Jones","Megan Lawton","Dr William
