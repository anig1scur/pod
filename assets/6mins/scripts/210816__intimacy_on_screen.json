This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina. When we think about romantic Hollywood movies, there have been some famous examples over the years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There are classic black-and-white romance movies like 1951\u2019s, \u2018A Streetcar Named Desire\u2019, and the love affair between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in \u2018Casablanca\u2019, made in 1942."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"You\u2019re really showing your age, Neil! What about more recent movies like \u2018When Harry met Sally\u2019 or that famous kiss between the characters Jack and Rose in the film, \u2018Titanic\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In their time all these movies were blockbusters \u2013 very popular and successful films which sold millions of cinema tickets. And this success was often due to the on-screen romance between the leading actors."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In romantic movies, love is in the air. Couples hold hands and kiss, or in other words they show intimacy \u2013 a close romantic, or sexual relationship."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But while real couples kiss and hold hands all the time, actors in movies are just pretending to be intimate, and this can lead to problems."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, whether it\u2019s a kiss or a full-nudity sex scene, filming intimate scenes for movies and TV is a delicate business, as we\u2019ll be finding out in this programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first, Georgina, I have a quiz question for you."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Let me guess\u2026 Another black-and-white classic from the 1950s?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes - 1953 to be exact. This movie won the Oscar for Best Picture. The film thrilled audiences with a famous beach kiss between actors, Burt Lancaster, and Deborah Kerr, as they rolled around in the waves \u2013 but what was the movie? Was it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, it was long before I was born but I\u2019ll guess, b) From Here to Eternity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Georgina, we\u2019ll find out later on if that\u2019s right. In 1953 an on-screen kiss was still considered a little naughty."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But by 2020 and the filming of the BBC television dramas, \u2018Normal People\u2019 and \u2018I May Destroy You\u2019, things had changed. Nudity and sexual content had become commonplace."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ita O'Brien worked on both these BBC dramas. She describes herself as an \u2018intimacy coordinator\u2019 - someone who helps actors and directors plan and film intimate scenes."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Listen as she gives her definition of intimacy to BBC World Service programme, The Conversation:"},{"author":"Ita O\u2019Brien","text":"A hand hold, a stroke of the cheek, you know, through to a hug, and then obviously, right the way through to intimate content \u2013 it might be familial content of an adult to a child; it could be the content of perhaps a medical procedure, someone having a mammogram, or it could be right the way through to intimacy, simulated sexual content."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ita\u2019s definition of intimacy is very wide, including hugging and stroking \u2013 gently touching someone in a pleasurable way."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It also includes simulated sex. Movie actors aren\u2019t really having sex, they\u2019re simulating it \u2013 pretending to do something so that it looks real but is not."},{"author":"Neil","text":"just like dance sequences in musicals, intimate movie scenes are planned and choreographed beforehand so that the director, film crew and, above all, the actors are comfortable with what\u2019s being filmed."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Georgina But recent scandals about the on-set behaviour of some British and American film stars have highlighted how delicate a balance this is."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here\u2019s Ita O\u2019Brien again talking to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Conversation, about the different ways that intimate scenes are filmed on either side of the Atlantic, in Britain and the US."},{"author":"Ita O\u2019Brien","text":"With actors from the US, what they do have, what they put in place is that with each and every intimate scene we create a nudity / simulated sex waiver , for each and every scene and I actually really like that way of working. In the UK actors are asked to sign a nudity clause and generally that\u2019s an overall, for the whole of a production."},{"author":"Neil","text":"British actors sign only one document with a nudity clause to cover the whole film. But in the US, actors sign a waiver \u2013 a legal document that allows or prevents an action that is different from how things are usually done."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ita thinks it\u2019s better if the actors agree to each and every scene \u2013 and she uses the phrase, \u2018each and every\u2019 because it emphasises that she means every single one."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this way there is no confusion about what should or shouldn\u2019t happen on set, leaving the director and actors free to make dramatic and romantic blockbusters."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"You mean like that famous beach scene, kissing and rolling in the waves, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, you mean my quiz question when I asked you: What was the name of the 1953 movie featuring a famous beach kiss between movie stars Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr? What did you say, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said it was b), From Here to Eternity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is\u2026 the right answer! Well done, Georgina \u2013 so you do like classic black-and-white movies after all!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Not really, Neil, but I remember my grandad watching it! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme about intimacy \u2013 a close romantic or sexual relationship."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A blockbuster is a very popular and successful movie or a book that sells many copies."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"If you stroke someone\u2019s face, you touch it gently in a pleasurable way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To simulate means to do or make something that looks real but is not."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In the US, a waiver is a legal document to either allow or prevent something being done in a different way from usual."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you can use the phrase, each and every to emphasise that you mean every single one of something."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s all for this romantic edition of 6 Minute English but join us here again soon for more topical chat and useful vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye for
