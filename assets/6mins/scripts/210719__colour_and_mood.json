This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This is the programme where we hope to add some colour to your life by talking about an interesting subject and teaching you some useful vocabulary."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And colour is what we\u2019re talking about today. What\u2019s your favourite colour, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, I like green \u2013 a fresh, bold colour, that reminds me of nature \u2013 it can have a calming effect. And you?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It\u2019s got to be blue \u2013 it reminds me of the sea, the sky \u2013 and holidays, of course!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Colour \u2013 no matter which one we prefer \u2013 affects how we feel. And we\u2019ll be talking about that soon. But not before I challenge you to answer my quiz question, Georgina \u2013 and it\u2019s a science question. Do you know what the splitting of white light into its different colours is called? Is it\u2026 a) dispersion b) reflection, or c) refraction?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmmm, well I\u2019m not a scientist, so I\u2019ll have a guess as c) refraction."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the right answer later on. But now, let\u2019s talk more about colour. Colour can represent many different things, depending on where you come from. You can be \u2018 green with envy\u2019 \u2013 wishing you had what someone else had."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And someone can feel blue \u2013 so feel depressed.  We choose colours to express ourselves in what we wear or how we decorate our home."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been talking about colour and whether it affects everyone\u2019s mood. Karen Haller is a colour psychologist and a colour designer and consultant \u2013 she explained how colour affects us\u2026"},{"author":"Karen Haller, colour psychologist and a colour design and consultant","text":"It\u2019s the way that we take in the wavelengths of light because colour is wavelengths of light, and it\u2019s how that comes in through our eye, and then it goes into the part of our brain called the hypothalamus, which governs our sleeping patterns, our hormones, our behaviours, our appetite \u2013 it governs everything and so different colours and different frequencies or different wavelengths of light, we have different responses and different reactions to them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, colour is wavelengths of light - a wavelength is the distance between two waves of sound or light that are next to each other. As these wavelengths change, so does the colour we see."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Thanks for the science lesson! Karen also explained that there\u2019s a part of our brain that controls \u2013 she used the word govern \u2013 how we feel and how we behave. And this can change depending on what colour we see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Interesting stuff \u2013 of course, colour can affect us differently. Seeing red can make one person angry but someone else may just feel energised."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Homeware and furnishing manufacturers offer a whole spectrum \u2013 or range \u2013 of colours to choose to suit everyone\u2019s taste, and mood. But during the recent coronavirus pandemic, there was a rise in demand for intense, bright shades and patterns. This was referred to as \u2018happy design\u2019 - design that was meant to help lift our mood."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, and Karen Haller spoke a bit more about this on the You and Yours programme\u2026"},{"author":"Karen Haller, colour psychologist and a colour design and consultant","text":"In the time when everyone was out and we were all working, and we lived very busy lives, quite often what people wanted \u2013 they wanted a quiet sanctuary to come back to, so they had very pale colours or very low chromatic colours in their house \u2013 low saturation \u2013 because that helped them unwind and helped them relax and to feel very soothed. But what I have found since the first lockdown is a lot of people, because they\u2019re not getting that outside stimulation , they\u2019re actually putting a lot of brighter colours in their home because they\u2019re trying to bring in that feeling that they would have got when they were out \u2013 that excitement and that buzz."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It seems that in our normal busy working lives, our homes were peaceful places and somewhere to relax \u2013 they were a sanctuary . To create this relaxing space, we use pale colours \u2013 ones that lack intensity, like sky blue."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But during the recent lockdowns, when we weren\u2019t outside much, we tried to get that stimulation - that excitement or experience \u2013 by decorating our homes with brighter colour.  Such as yellow!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmmm, perhaps a little too bright for me! It is all about personal taste and the connections we make with the colours we see but it makes sense that brighter colours can certainly lift our mood."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, earlier I asked you, Georgina, do you know what the splitting of white light into its different colours is called? Is it\u2026 a) dispersion b) reflection, or c) refraction?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I said it was refraction."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sorry Georgina, that\u2019s wrong. It is actually called dispersion. Back to school for you \u2013 but not before we recap some of today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK. Firstly we can describe someone who wishes they had what someone else has, as being green with envy ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We also talked about a wavelength - the distance between two waves of sound or light that are next to each other."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"To govern means to control or influence."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A sanctuary can be a peaceful or relaxing place \u2013 in some cases it can be a safe place for someone in danger."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Stimulation describes the feeling of being excited, interested or enthused by something. And pale describes a colour that lacks intensity, it\u2019s not very bright \u2013 and for me, they\u2019re much better than a bold bright yellow!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Georgina,  thanks for showing your true colours! That\u2019s all for now, but we\u2019ll be picking another topic to discuss out of the blue, next time."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Don\u2019t forget you can hear other 6 Minute English programmes and much more on our website at bbclearningenglish.com \u2013 and we\u2019re always posting stuff on our social media platforms.
