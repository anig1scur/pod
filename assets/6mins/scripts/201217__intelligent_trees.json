Or doing exercise classes in the kitchen?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Actually, Neil, I\u2019ve been doing some online research into my family history . I\u2019m investigating my family tree \u2013 you know, a drawing showing all the relationships between the different members of my family."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, how interesting! And how appropriate - because trees are the subject of this programme \u2013 not family trees but real, living-in-the-forest trees."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, Neil, this might surprise you but according to some people, trees also have families. There are mother trees who support and help feed child trees."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right. According to Suzanne Simard, one of the world\u2019s leading tree researchers, trees should be seen as intelligent. They communicate with each other. They help each other. And as you mentioned, Georgina, they can even tell their family members."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So a tree can have its own family tree \u2013 amazing! Tell me more."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, but first let me ask you my quiz question. The largest trees in a wood or forest are called \u2018mother trees\u2019. As they\u2019re the biggest, mother trees usually have the longest, most connected roots. So my question is this \u2013 what is the world\u2019s largest currently living tree? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmmm\u2026 I\u2019ve seen photos of redwood trees in California and they\u2019re huge, so I\u2019ll say b) a giant redwood."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Georgina, I\u2019m sure you only chose that cause it\u2019s the easiest one to pronounce but we\u2019ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now let\u2019s get back to that tree researcher, Suzanne Simard."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Her big idea was the \u2018wood wide web\u2019 \u2013 a way of describing the network of underground roots linking trees to other trees of the same family."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here\u2019s Suzanne explaining more about tree families to BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea:"},{"author":"Suzanne Simard","text":"We found that the parent trees would favour those seedlings that were of their own kin versus the strangers."},{"author":"David Edmonds","text":"That\u2019s extraordinary \u2013 and when you say they favour their own family members, you mean they\u2019ll send more nutrients to their offspring than they would to, as it were, a stranger tree?"},{"author":"Suzanne Simard","text":"That\u2019s right."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Mother trees send food and nutrients to their own seedlings \u2013 young plants that have been grown from a seed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this way, parent trees help their offspring \u2013 another word for their children, or young. Mother trees can recognise and feed other trees of their own kin \u2013 an old fashioned word meaning family."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"With the extra nutrients and carbon they receive, the offspring can extend their own root network and suck up even more nutrients\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026which in turn increases their own growth, turning some of them into the giants we see growing in California and other parts of the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Amazing! With trees behaving in clever ways like this it\u2019s no wonder Suzanne thinks they have intelligence."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s not all. Listen again as Suzanne discusses the question of whether trees are \u2018alive\u2019 with BBC World Service\u2019s, The Big Idea. See if you can hear her opinion."},{"author":"Suzanne Simard","text":"Alive in the sense of having agency in their destinies, instead of being you know\u2026 I think a lot of people think of trees as just sort of like these sticks that grow out of the ground, they\u2019re kind of these inert things that don\u2019t have agency in their destiny , that they don\u2019t change behaviours and make decisions but what we\u2019re finding is that they do all that. And you know what step back and think trees have evolved over a long long long time, way longer than human beings and they have evolved in communities and they have to grow and survive."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I think Suzanne believes trees are alive and intelligent, because she says they have agency \u2013 a concept meaning having the ability to act and effect your environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dying trees even seem to know the future \u2013 before they die, they warn their offspring to start making new root connections."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Showing that trees have some understanding of their destiny \u2013 everything that happens in someone\u2019s life and what will happen in the future."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So it seems that trees are much more intelligent than we thought, Georgina."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It\u2019s certainly going to change how I feel about going for a walk in the woods, surrounded by all those intelligent trees chatting to each other. I wonder if they have family arguments."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ha. Well, I wouldn\u2019t argue with one of those really gigantic tree, such as\u2026 well, Georgina, you tell me."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah, you mean your quiz question - about the largest living tree?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exactly. What did you say?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said the largest currently living tree was, b) a giant redwood. Was I correct, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you got the \u2018giant\u2019 part right, Georgina, but in fact the answer was c) a giant sequoia named General Sherman. He lives in California\u2019s Giant Forest, he\u2019s a whopping 83 metres tall and measures a massive 33 metres around the trunk!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Wow! And I bet he has a huge family tree!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ha-ha. Right then, Georgina, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve used discussing intelligent trees, starting with family tree \u2013 a diagram showing the relationships between family members."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Trees are intelligent enough to communicate with their children, or offspring . These young plants which have grown from seeds are also known as seedlings ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Another word we learned is kin \u2013 an old-fashioned way of saying family."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"According to tree expert Suzanne Simard, trees have agency \u2013 a term describing the ability to act and influence your surroundings."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the fact that trees make all kinds of decisions about their lives suggests they understand their destiny - everything that happens to someone during their life, including in the future."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Thank you for joining our walk through the woods of English vocabulary.
