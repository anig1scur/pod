I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil. Hey Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hello Dan. What\u2019s on the agenda today?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I\u2019ll give you a clue. It\u2019s something that makes the world go round, but it doesn\u2019t really exist. In fact, if we all stopped believing in it, it would have no use at all! What is it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I haven\u2019t got a clue!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ok...how about this?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Money! Dan Yep! And not just any money, we\u2019re talking about crypto- currency . Neil Currency is the money that\u2019s being used in a given country at a certain time. But what about the cryptopart?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, crypto is a prefix meaning hidden or secret \u2013 it comes from the word cryptic which means mysterious or difficult to understand. You may have heard about the most popular crypto-currency at the moment, the Bitcoin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well I\u2019ve certainly heard the name, but I can\u2019t say I know what it is."},{"author":"Dan","text":"First our quiz question. When was the Bitcoin crypto-currency first created?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I think 2004 may have been a little early, and I think 2013 could be a little late, so the smart money\u2019s on 2009."},{"author":"Dan","text":"We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re right later on in the show. So\u2026Bitcoin, what do you know about it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I know it\u2019s a digital currency\u2026so presumably you can use it online to buy things?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"You are right on the money, which means correct, both times. Bitcoin is just like any other currency except for two things. First, it\u2019s not printed by governments or banks, which means that it\u2019s not legal tender."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Legal tender means the official money that can be used within a country. So that means we can\u2019t use it to pay taxes or settle debts, right?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly. Governments won\u2019t recognise it as an official currency, although it acts just like one. You can use it to buy items from anyone who will accept it, and its value fluctuates ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Fluctuates means changes in level or amount. And what\u2019s the second thing?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ah, the second thing is that bitcoin is a digital currency, meaning that with the exception of a few tokens, it largely exists online only. You can\u2019t carry a load of bitcoins around in your pocket!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that makes a nice\u2026change!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh dear, Neil. Was that a money pun? Terrible!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So if it\u2019s a digital only currency, where do new ones come from? Can\u2019t I just say that I\u2019ve got a million of them and make myself rich!?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, no. You see, even though Bitcoin is not regulated by a bank or government, it still has a process that stops people from cheating. There are only two ways to get bitcoins. You either trade them from someone, or you go mining."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh wait, I've heard about this. This is when you use your computer to run calculations which verify other Bitcoin transactions. You get rewarded for this \u2018work\u2019 by earning bitcoins."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yep! It\u2019s money for old rope, which means it\u2019s an easy way to earn money."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow! I\u2019m going to start mining immediately!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, you wouldn\u2019t be the only one! Bitcoin\u2019s value has recently gone up quite a lot and this has caused a lot of interest. In fact, one stock exchange in Chicago has begun trading in Bitcoin futures contracts."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A futures contract? What\u2019s that? Dan I\u2019ll let BBC correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones explain that."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC correspondent A futures contract, a bet on where the currency will be a month from now, soared above 18,000 dollars. That means that investors believe Bitcoin, which started the year worth under 1000 dollars will continue to rise in value, albeit at a slower rate.  But at the big banks there\u2019s still plenty of scepticism about the currency."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Soared in this context means increased very quickly. So, now big investors are betting on the value of Bitcoin in the future."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes. But he also mentioned that the banks have a lot of scepticism . That's a doubt that something is real or true. In this case, whether Bitcoin is reliable or not."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe it\u2019s best I don\u2019t get involved then. After all, a fool and his money are soon parted."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, you don\u2019t have to be sceptical about the answer to our quiz. We know that for a fact. I asked you when the Bitcoin crypto-currency was first created."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said 2009."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you were right! Well done. Shall we go over the vocabulary again?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"First we had currency . That\u2019s the money being used in a given country at a certain time. Name three currencies and their countries, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Ok. Baht for Thailand. Rupee for India and my favourite, Metical for Mozambique. Next we had cryptic . Something which is cryptic is mysterious or difficult to understand. For example, what do rich people need, poor people have and if you eat it, you die?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A cryptic riddle indeed! I\u2019ll have to think about that. Then we had legal tender , that\u2019s the official money that can be used within a country. The Euro is legal tender within Spain, but what was the legal tender before that?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Wasn\u2019t it the Peseta? Then we had fluctuates . If something fluctuates, it changes in amount or level. The stock market fluctuates."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But my love for my family never does. Then we had soared , which means increased very quickly. It\u2019s used with this meaning in the context of money, prices and statistics."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Finally we had scepticism . Scepticism is doubt that something is real or true. What sort of things are people sceptical about, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Some people think that human activity hasn\u2019t caused climate change. They are sceptical."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And that brings us to the end of today\u2019s 6 Minute English.
