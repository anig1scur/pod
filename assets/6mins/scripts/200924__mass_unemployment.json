I\u2019ll say b) one third of a billion people unemployed around the world."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll come back to that later. Now, mass unemployment \u2013 millions of people losing their jobs due to the Covid pandemic \u2013 has left the world facing an enormous jobs challenge. Elisabeth Reynolds, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is author of the report \u2018Work of the Future\u2019. Here she is talking to BBC World Service programme, Business Daily, about the current situation:"},{"author":"Elisabeth Reynolds","text":"Well I think in the short term it does feel like we are not yet in a place where we can talk about recovery and rebuilding completely \u2013 we\u2019re still gonna see the ramifications, the impact and the ripple effect of all this for months to come."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We use the expressions, \u2018in the long term\u2019 and in the short term to talk about what will happen over a long or short period of time.

Like throwing a stone into water, these consequences create a ripple effect \u2013 a situation where one event causes a series of effects which spread and produce further effects."},{"author":"Sam","text":"According to Elisabeth, the problem is that many of the government measures put in place to support jobs are not sustainable in the long term. She says more radical change is needed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course the big question is \u2013 how? One proposed solution is the Danish model. This balances citizens\u2019 rights and duties."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Denmark provides one of the world\u2019s most generous unemployment payouts but in return citizens are expected to commit to any job or training the government thinks would be beneficial."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington, is himself a Dane. Here he explains to BBC Business Daily how the model works:"},{"author":"Jacob Kirkegaard","text":"It\u2019s very easy to hire and fire people in Denmark \u2013 it doesn\u2019t cost you anything and you don\u2019t have sort of a guaranteed job for life once you get a permanent contract, which is the situation in many other continental European countries\u2026 so it combines labour market flexibility with employment security\u2026 namely the idea that people, if they lose their job, they know that they can find another job even if that requires them to pick up new skills \u2013 because that upskilling - or reskilling - is going to be made available to them, partly through very lavish government subsides."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Denmark enjoys labour flexibility because it\u2019s easy for bosses to hire and fire \u2013 employ someone and release them from employment, meaning there\u2019s no such thing as a job for life \u2013 one that you can stay in all your working life."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But citizens also have the security of lavish \u2013 generous and expensive \u2013 benefits, and the government will also pay for worker upskilling - training to learn new skills making them better at their jobs..."},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2026and thereby preventing unemployment \u2013 which reminds me of your quiz question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you how many people were predicted to lose their jobs to the Covid pandemic."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said b) one third of a billion."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, fortunately it\u2019s the slightly lower, but still worrying, figure of, one quarter of a billion people."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ve been discussing predictions of mass unemployment in the short term \u2013 or over a short time period, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It also seems we will be experiencing the ripple effects \u2013 series of consequences, of the virus for a long time to come."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One solution to mass unemployment may be the Danish model, were the power to hire or fire \u2013 employ someone or make them unemployed \u2013 means there are not many jobs for life \u2013 jobs you can do all your working life."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But lavish \u2013 expensive and generous - benefits from the government, who also pay for upskilling or training in new skills, means that Danish unemployment is rarely out of control."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all we have time for, but come back soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
