This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Kalettes\u2019, \u2018CauliShoots\u2019, and \u2018Tenderstems\u2019\u2026 Can you guess what they are, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, they sound like the names of pop groups to me!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, good guess, but in fact the truth is even stranger \u2013 they\u2019re varieties of vegetable being grown in the UK by a new generation of fruit and veg growers. Forget traditional carrots, leeks and potatoes - vegetables today are getting a modern makeover thanks to breeding methods which mix two different plants to produce something completely new, known as a hybrid."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The hybrid , Kalette, for example is a mix between kale and a Brussel sprout."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tenderstems are a mix of traditional broccoli with a type of Chinese kale."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And CauliShoots are small green stems with mini cauliflower heads shooting out the side. These exciting new varieties, which look very different from traditional vegetables, are increasingly popular on farms, in shops and in restaurants across the UK. In this programme, we\u2019ll hear all about these new vegetables and the people who grow, cook and eat them. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sounds good, Sam! But first I have a question for you. One of the first hybrids on sale in the UK was named, Cotton Candy, because of its sweet, caramel flavour. But is Cotton Candy: a) a cherry? b) a strawberry?  or c) a grape?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, if it\u2019s sweet, I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s a strawberry."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well, we\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. The Kalettes which Sam mentioned earlier, were introduced in the British market in 2010 under the name, \u2018Flower Sprouts\u2019. They were advertised as a healthy vegetable that could be cooked or eaten raw and became extremely popular."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The inventor of the Kalette is Jamie Claxton, one of the UK\u2019s top seed producers and head of plant breeding firm, Tozer Seeds. Here\u2019s Jamie chatting with, Leyla Kazim, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."},{"author":"Leyla Kazim","text":"And so how did the idea of the Kalette even come about in the first place?"},{"author":"Jamie Claxton","text":"We do quite a lot of blue-sky breeding where we just try wacky stuff and see what happens."},{"author":"Leyla Kazim","text":"Were you looking at sprout and a kale going, \u2018I could do something exciting with this\u2019."},{"author":"Jamie Claxton","text":"We were looking at the whole of the brassica family, those are all brassica oleracea - Brussels sprouts, kales, cauliflowers, and just thinking how\u2026 Obviously we knew they would cross pollinate easily and produce unusual veg, and we were just kind of thinking we need to create something that's more modern, you know, Brussels sprouts and kales are very traditional\u2026 Throw a few things in together in a mixing pot thing and see what comes out."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Jamie says Kalettes were the result of blue-sky breeding. This phrase comes from another expression, blue-sky thinking , which means using your imagination to try to come up with completely new and original ideas."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Some of Jamie\u2019s plants were wacky - unusual in a funny or surprising way, but this was all part of the fun of breeding and growing new vegetables. Jamie threw his ideas into the mixing pot \u2013 a place where different ideas mingle together to create something new."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hybrid vegetables add exciting new colours and tastes to traditional veg, such as the deep purple leaves of rainbow kale, or the sweet nutty flavour of a CauliShoot. As a result, they have become fashionable with many British chefs, including Jack Stein, son of TV chef, Rick, who runs a restaurant in the seaside town of Padstow in Cornwall."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme, Leyla Kazim, again, talking to Jack about what makes a great new vegetable."},{"author":"Leyla Kazim","text":"When you\u2019re looking at new varieties of veg, are there any particular traits that you're looking for that will help in the kitchen?"},{"author":"Jack Stein","text":"I mean, obviously it's gonna be down to taste really, and it's gonna be down to what it looks like on the plates. The colour, the texture, the taste, all these things are really important, but I think novelty and things like the Kalettes were great. I mean, they were originally called \u2018Flower Sprouts\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Jack names two features of great hybrid veg. First, there\u2019s the texture \u2013 the way something feels when you touch it\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And second, novelty \u2013 the fact that something is new and unusual. Added to the surprising way many new varieties look, and of course their great taste, modern vegetables have provided a welcome new addition to traditional British cooking."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And don\u2019t forget the unusual names too, Sam, like the \u2018Cotton Candy\u2019 fruit I asked you about in my question."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, I guessed Cotton Candies were a new variety of strawberry. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were wrong I\u2019m afraid, Sam. In fact, Cotton Candy is a variety of grape, so called because they\u2019re very sweet and taste like you\u2019ve been to the fairground. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about new vegetable hybrids \u2013 plants which have been grown by mixing two different plants together."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Blue-sky thinking involves using your imagination to try and think up original ideas."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Something which is unusual in a funny or surprising way could be described as wacky."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The mixing pot is a place where different ideas or ingredients get mixed to create something new."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Texture means the way something feels when you touch it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, novelty is the quality of being new or unusual. If you\u2019ve enjoyed this programme, why not take the taste test by cooking some hybrid vegetables yourself."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And remember to join us again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.
