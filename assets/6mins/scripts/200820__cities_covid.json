For example, buildings in 19th century Paris were designed with large, high-up windows to allow plenty of sunlight. They were supposed to stop the spread of tuberculosis."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Coronavirus has been no different. In lockdown, cities from Rio to Barcelona were transformed as wildlife and birdsong replaced the noise of taxi horns and traffic.

Now, Beatriz Colomina is a professor of architecture at Princeton University in the United States. She\u2019s spent years researching the relationship between cities and disease. Here she is talking with Kavita Puri, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry :"},{"author":"Kavita Puri","text":"Take tuberculosis. Unlike cholera, which was eliminated in London by re-designing the sewage system in the 1850s, TB was airborne ."},{"author":"Professor Colomina","text":"It became a real problem with the rise of the industrial cities, the metropolis , before an antibiotic was effective."},{"author":"Kavita Puri","text":"One in seven people on the planet had TB, but in dense cities like Paris, it was one in three. Closely packed tenements meant the disease spread like wildfire and architects and planning experts responded."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Some diseases, like cholera, could be prevented by redesigning cities to improve hygiene, like the waste water sewers in 19th century London. But the problem with tuberculosis, or TB for short, was that the disease is airborne \u2013 carried and spread in the air."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Adding to the problem was the fact that antibiotics \u2013 medicines like penicillin that can destroy harmful bacteria or stop their growth \u2013 was not discovered until 1928  \u2013  too late to save the thousands of people who died in Mumbai, New York, Paris and other cities during the 1800s."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Diseases like TB killed more and more people as cities industrialised and grew bigger and bigger, leading to the creation of the metropolis \u2013 the largest, busiest and most important city in a country or region."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many people crowded together in large metropolises meaning that disease could spread like wildfire \u2013 an idiom meaning spread quickly around many people."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Even today disease is shaping our cities. In post-Covid Paris, new ideas for a\u201915 minute city\u2019 aim to make all public services available within a fifteen minute walk to help people working from home."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Other countries want to build better, more affordable housing outside the city centre."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But according to Mumbai resident Dr Vaidehi Tandel this won\u2019t work \u2013 even if the housing on offer is better. But why? The reason is work."},{"author":"Dr Vaidehi Tandel ","text":"When you shift them out, you\u2019re moving them away from their livelihoods and they\u2019re not going to be able to sustain themselves there so they will be coming back because their jobs are in the city and they cannot afford the commute from further off places."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dr Vaidehi Tandel there, talking on the BBC World Service programme The Inquiry.Trying to make cities less crowded is one way to minimise the risks from disease. But moving people away from the city centre means moving them away from their livelihood \u2013 their job or other way of earning money to pay for food, housing and clothing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many people still want to live near their workplace in the city centre because they can\u2019t afford to pay for the commute \u2013 the journey between their home and their place of work."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which is real problem when you live in a city of\u2026 how many people did you say live in Mumbai, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, in our quiz question I asked you what the estimated population of Mumbai is."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said b) 20 million."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you were absolutely right! Around 20 million people live in the Mumbai metropolis , making it very difficult to socially distance."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme we\u2019ve been discussing the relationship between cities and disease. In the 1800s, tuberculous, or TB, killed thousands because it was an airborne disease \u2013 spread in the air, and hard to prevent."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Antibiotics \u2013 medicinal chemicals like penicillin which can destroy harmful germs, couldn\u2019t help because they weren\u2019t discovered until decades later."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So in metropolises \u2013 the largest and most important cities, where people live crowded close together, diseases spread like wildfire \u2013 an idiom meaning spread widely and quickly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In Mumbai and other places, the problem remains that many people need the city for their livelihood \u2013 job or other way of earning money."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So they prefer to live in the city centre instead of paying for the daily commute \u2013 a journey, often by train, bus or car, from your home to your workplace."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all we have time for in this programme, but remember you can find more useful vocabulary, trending topics and help with your language learning here at BBC Learning English.
