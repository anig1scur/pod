Huge amounts of carbon are generated when the musicians and fans travel the world to attend a gig.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019ve been reading about ways to protect the environment, Rob, and I\u2019ve decided to eat less meat. And maybe drive my car less too."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Good for you, Neil! And flying less can also help reduce air pollution."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. Flying and driving less are two good ways to combat climate change because they reduce your carbon footprint \u2013 that\u2019s the amount of carbon dioxide or CO2 released into the atmosphere as a result of your everyday activities."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The idea of reducing carbon emissions is catching on in the music industry too. Bands and artists who go on tour around the world generate large carbon footprints."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So recently some music groups like Massive Attack and Green Day started thinking about ways to reduce the impact their tours are having on the environment."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ha! Green Day \u2013 what a good name for a band trying to be environmentally friendly!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Today we\u2019ll be finding out about bands and musicians who want to continue going on tour but do it in ways which reduce their environmental impact. And of course we\u2019ll be learning some related vocabulary on the way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, it seems like the days of rock and roll stars flying around the world in private jets may soon be a thing of the past."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed, Rob, and that brings me neatly to my quiz question. One British band recently announced they would stop going on tour until they were 100% carbon neutral, but which band? Was it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Coldplay had a hit with their song The Scientist, and we are talking about carbon dioxide and the climate, so I\u2019ll  say c) Coldplay."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good thinking, Rob! We\u2019ll find out the answer later. But first let\u2019s hear from another artist concerned about her carbon impact. Fay Milton is the drummer of the band Savages and co-founder of the climate pressure group Music Declares Emergency. She spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme You & Yours:"},{"author":"Fay Milton","text":"This year I have actually turned down a tour. My income comes from touring so it has put me in a bit of a precarious situation but I actually feel quite good about it \u2013 it feels like the right thing to do in this moment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even though Fay earns a living as a drummer by going on tour, she has started to turn them down \u2013 meaning to reject or refuse the offer of touring."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Losing the income she usually gets from touring puts Fay in a precarious situation \u2013 a situation where things could become difficult, in this case financially difficult, because she isn\u2019t making money from playing the drums."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But she still wants to do the right thing \u2013 in other words, do what is most fair, ethical and just. For Fay, fighting climate change is even more important than doing what she loves \u2013 going on tour with the band."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, good for her! I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be so committed as Fay. But if bands stopped touring altogether, fans wouldn\u2019t get to see gigs \u2013 or live concerts and hear the music they love."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s an interesting point because it might be possible for bands to carry on touring and also reduce their environmental impact at the same time. Bristol band, Massive Attack, want to do exactly that. Their singer Robert Del Naja explains:"},{"author":"Robert Del Naja","text":"We\u2019re working with an electric bus company. We\u2019re going to look at all the energy being renewable and obviously the power we can create will go back to the grid , so we\u2019re hoping we can actually create legacy green infrastructure which can then power future gigs. We plan to travel to Europe solely by train, with the band, the crewand all the gear."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Swapping tour planes for trains and encouraging fans to travel to gigs by bus are two good ways to reduce the total carbon footprint of the concert."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And by using renewable energy, the gig can create power. This can then be put back into the national grid, called the grid for short \u2013 the network supplying electrical power across a country."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Massive Attack are certainly ticking all the green boxes, Neil, but who else is doing a good job? Remember your quiz question earlier?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, yes. I asked which band has decided to stop touring until their tours were carbon neutral and you said?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said c) Coldplay."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you were right! Are you a Coldplay fan, Rob? Just remember to leave your car at home the next time you go to their gig!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right! Today, we\u2019ve been looking at some of the ways music bands and artists are trying to fight climate change. They want to reduce their carbon footprint \u2013 the amount of carbon they release into the air."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Some musicians are starting to turn down \u2013 or refuse, long world tour dates because flying from country to country playing gigs \u2013 or live musical concerts, generates so much carbon dioxide."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bands like Savages, Green Day and Massive Attack are trying to do the right thing -  taking the most fair and ethical course of action, even though for some artists, the income lost from not touring puts them in a precarious \u2013 or difficult situation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But when they get it right, bands can be carbon neutral or even generate power which can be put back into t he national grid \u2013 the network supplying electrical power across a country."},{"author":"Rob","text":"All of which means we can \u2018keep on rocking\u2019 into the next century without increasing carbon emissions and adding to climate change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, Rob, you could say you were \u2018born to run\u2019\u2026 on renewable energy!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ha-ha! Very funny, Neil. That\u2019s all for today but remember to join us again soon for more topical discussions and vocabulary from 6 Minute English, here at BBC Learning English."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks for listening and bye!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye."}],"authors":["","Neil","Rob","Fay Milton","Robert Del
