We\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In face-to-face meetings, we immediately see someone\u2019s reaction to what we\u2019ve said through eye contact , where two people look into each other\u2019s eyes as they talk."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unfortunately, using a web camera to make eye contact is almost impossible in online meetings and this often creates a kind of \u2018distancing\u2019 effect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Erica Dhawan makes several suggestions to help with this. See if you can hear the final suggestion she makes to Michael Rosen as part of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Word of Mouth."},{"author":"Erica Dhawan","text":"And last but not least, slow down. Remember when it was completely normal to have a one-minute pause in a room with one another because we knew when we\u2019re thinking and brainstorming . If we don\u2019t hear someone speak on video, we ask them if they\u2019re on mute. Practise what I call the five-second rule \u2013 wait five seconds before speaking to make sure that individuals have time to process the ideas, especially if there may be technology or accessibility issues."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Did you hear Erica\u2019s last piece of advice, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, she recommends slowing down, something we do naturally face-to-face when we\u2019re thinking or brainstorming \u2013 that\u2019s discussing suggestions with a group of people to come up with new ideas or to solve problems."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Slowing down gives us time to process new information \u2013 to understand it by thinking carefully and reflecting on it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Erica compares online body language to learning a new language - it takes practice, especially when it comes to smiling and laughing, something Michael Rosen finds hard to do in video meetings."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Listen to him discussing this problem with Erica Dhawan for BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Word of Mouth."},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"Do you think it\u2019s killing off people laughing and smiling in the way we do when we\u2019re altogether in the live situation?"},{"author":"in unison","text":"I would say that it is much less likely that we laugh and smile on camera for a few reasons. Number one, laughing is often done  where we can quickly pick up the energy of someone smiling or laughing and feed off of that and laugh ourselves. When it comes to screen delays, the fact that it\u2019s not natural to see our own camera \u2013 being distracted by that \u2013 we are much less likely to laugh and smile. One of the ways we can overcome this is by creating intentional moments in our meetings for the water cooler effect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Erica points out that laughing often happens in unison \u2013 together and at the same time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, if someone starts laughing it makes me laugh too."},{"author":"Sam","text":"She also thinks it\u2019s important to make time for employees to chat informally about things unrelated to work \u2013 their weekend plans or last night\u2019s TV show."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And she uses the expression, the water cooler effect which comes from the United States where office workers sometimes meet at the water fountain to chat."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, the water cooler effect refers to informal conversations that people have in their office or workplace, maybe in the lift, the office kitchen or, if there is one, by an actual water cooler."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Erica Dhawan seems very comfortable communicating online, but she\u2019s had lots of time to practice since her schooldays."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, Neil, in your quiz question you asked how Erica conquered her shyness at school. I guessed that she raised her hand to answer the teacher\u2019s questions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It was a good guess, Sam, but the correct answer is b \u2013 she copied the body language of her cool teenage classmates, so probably lots of rolled eyes and slouching!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme about online body language \u2013 non-verbal ways of communicating using the body."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Eye contact is when two people look at each other\u2019s eyes at the same time."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Brainstorming involves a group discussion to generate new ideas or solutions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When we process information, we think about it carefully in order to understand it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In unison means happening together and at the same time"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, the water cooler effect is an American expression to describe informal conversations between people at work."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Neil is looking at his watch, which is body language that tells me our six minutes are up!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye for
