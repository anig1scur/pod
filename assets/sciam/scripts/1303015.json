      "text": ": I\u2019m glad you asked, Josh! Scientists have known for some time that people can shed the SARS-CoV-2 virus in our excrement. Traces of virus in our sewage systems can often be detected before a surge in clinical COVID cases. So they can provide early warning of an outbreak. And they can spot infections from people regardless of whether or not they\u2019re showing symptoms\u00a0or if they have access to testing. What\u2019s new is that the CDC has started adding data from wastewater sampling sites to its dashboard, the COVID Data Tracker. The agency first launched the National Wastewater Surveillance System in September 2020. Now\u00a0they have more than 400 monitoring sites around the country, and they\u2019re planning to add 250 more in the next few weeks. That\u2019s according to Amy Kirby, the program\u2019s team lead, who was speaking in a press briefing. You can look up specific U.S. counties and see whether there\u2019s been an increase or decrease in SARS-CoV-2 levels in their wastewater. If a county hasn\u2019t provided data recently, it\u2019s shown in gray. Right now\u00a0there aren\u2019t that many sites that are frequently submitting data, but you can still get an idea of how cases are trending based on the colors of dots on the map. Wastewater tracking could also be useful for spotting new variants. In fact, a recent study of the sewage system in New York City\u00a0found several so-called cryptic\u00a0variants that were not seen in any clinical samples from patients. The researchers suggested that these could have come from an isolated setting like a nursing home\u00a0or even from animals like rats\u2014of which there is no shortage in NYC\u2019s sewers. They found traces of rat, dog\u00a0and cat RNA in the wastewater. This adds to worries that animals could serve as a reservoir for the virus. In fact, many white-tailed deer in the U.S. have already been found to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Wastewater monitoring isn\u2019t just limited to COVID\u2014it could also be used to detect outbreaks of other pathogens, like flu or antibiotic resistant microbes, or even patterns of opioid use, scientists say. Our poop is a veritable gold mine!"

      "text": ": Not this month, Tanya, and not next month either. The Food and Drug Administration and the vaccine maker Pfizer, which has been testing shots in the littlest children,\u00a0 wanted kids\u2019 vaccines to happen. So do lots of parents, who have been desperate to get their little children vaccinated. There are about 18 million kids under the age of five, and they go to day care and nursery school and pre-K and playgroups. Vaccines have been approved for everyone aged five and up. But these littlest ones have been out there, unprotected. The tests of these vaccines, however, were not rousing success stories. They showed the vaccines were quite safe in little kids. Yet they didn\u2019t show the shots produced immunity in children aged two through five.\u00a0 These shots\u2014two of them, each smaller than the adult dose\u2014did work in kids under age two, including infants. They produced levels of antibodies just like the levels that stopped infections in teenagers.\u00a0 For the two and ups, Pfizer decided to add a third shot to the regimen and test that. And they applied for approval for the two-shot routine. The reasoning is that the vaccine was safe in kids, it worked in the infants\u00a0and that starting the doses now will get the older kids to their third shot faster. But it\u2019s unusual to approve something when not all the data are in. That bothered some scientists on the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, such as vaccinologist Paul Offit of the Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia. He didn\u2019t want to approve a shot without seeing more evidence that it actually worked.\u00a0 Apparently a number of other experts shared that sentiment. Last week the FDA, which had encouraged Pfizer\u2019s application, suddenly reversed course. They canceled a meeting of the advisory committee that was going to review the application, saying it would be better to\u00a0wait for complete three-dose data. Pfizer agreed, and it expects that info to be available in early April. The Omicron variant played a role in this back-and-forth. More kids started to be hospitalized in early January than ever before\u2014about 800 per week\u2014and that made the agency look for ways to work fast. But the variant also infected kids in thetwo-dose Pfizer trial, making the third dose even more important to judge effectiveness. So officials made the decision to wait. Plus, the pace of Omicron infection has started to wane. Above all, I think, nobody wanted to seem like they were taking shortcuts when it came to kids, and moving ahead now seemed more and more like cutting corners. Some vaccine experts worried that it would raise parents\u2019 suspicions. So now it\u2019s wait until April. That\u2019s distressing to parents who thought they\u2019d be able to extend protection to their little ones. But it\u2019s also following the science\u00a0and not getting ahead of it. Now you\u2019re up to speed. Thanks for joining us. Our show is edited by the inimitable Jeff DelViscio."
