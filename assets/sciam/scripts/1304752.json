Most of them are ants\u2014these poor, poor ants.\u00a0 [CLIP: Whimsical piano music] They just went out one day, doing their ant thing, and happened upon a little spore that soon took over their entire body. The fungus puppeted each ant\u2019s little legs, taking it away from its bustling colony and up a stalk, where it would wait to die.\u00a0 Then a giant, fuzzy, spore-covered pillar called a fruiting body would eject itself from the ant\u2019s carcass."

      "text": "Zombie ants have been especially famous since the TV show The Last of Us first started airing on HBO this year. In the show and the game it\u2019s based on, the so-called zombie ant fungus has made a fateful leap from ants to humans and caused a global pandemic. [CLIP: Excerpt from The Last of Us: Cordyceps, Aspergillus, any one of them could become capable of burrowing into our brains and taking control not of millions of us, but billions of us.]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Every mycologist I\u2019ve spoken with says this jump is impossible without hand-wavy sci-fi logic. But it is true that we don\u2019t actually know that much about Ophiocordyceps. Of the few hundred species we\u2019ve found under that umbrella, 35 manipulate their prey\u2019s behavior. But Jo\u00e3o estimates there could be as many as 600 manipulators out there to be discovered."

His travels have taken him across the world, including Colombia, Ghana, and the Amazon. Most recently, he traveled to the Atlantic Forest on the coast of Brazil, a rain forest that\u2019s even more endangered than the Amazon. Ninety-two percent of the Atlantic Forest has been destroyed. And hiding among the 8 percent of remaining trees are living, undocumented treasures."

The fungus managed to throw the spores, or get the spores into this burrow to infect the spider. And when it is infected, the fungus consumes the spider and literally mummifies it. And then, after the host is killed, these fruiting bodies emerge and grow out of the body of the spider and grow out of the trapdoor."

Because of that, Jo\u00e3o doesn\u2019t call them zombie spiders, even though the public might tend to make that comparison. But manipulators or not, these groups of fungi are vast. Jo\u00e3o\u2019s travels have produced many uncharacterized species of Ophiocordyceps and related fungi, including manipulators and nonmanipulators. The dried-up victims of many of these species are laying on the board in front of me."

    {
      "author": "Ara\u00fajo: ",
      "text": "So these groups are evolved through host jumps. The ancestral host of all the genus Ophiocordyceps was a beetle larvae, likely killed on the tree, a fallen tree trunk in the forest, a log. So back then the ancestral lineage infecting beetles in the log would have jumped to the ants that also live in logs. And eventually, one lineage have evolved the ability to manipulate behavior."

    {
      "author": "Ara\u00fajo",
      "text": ": The driving force for this behavioral manipulation was this phenomenon called social immunity, which is the public health system of the ants. So when they find out that one of the nest mates are infected, they rip them apart, kill them or kick them out from the nest so the disease don\u2019t spread within the colony. So the behavior manipulation was a strategy that the fungus developed. The fungus will lead the ant to leave the nest, and so avoiding the social immunity, before it starts to develop symptoms. So that\u2019s completely against their nature, especially for social insects, altruistic. So it has to break something, some connection there. So what social insect has that enables the fungus to hijack their brain? So there\u2019s something there that we need still to investigate to answer."
