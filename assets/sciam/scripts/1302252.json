Henrik Mouritsen is a biologist at the University of Oldenburg in Germany. Together with an international team of scientists, he investigated another sense birds can use to help them\u2014the earth\u2019s magnetic field. Peter Hore\u00a0is a physical chemist on that team\u00a0at the University of Oxford in the U.K."

      "text": ": In fact, the strength of the magnetic field influences how many of the proteins go down one of those chemical reaction pathways versus the other. What happens next in a bird\u2019s eye isn\u2019t totally clear. But they think one of those magnetically sensitive reactions produces a form of the protein with a different shape\u2014which might cause it to interact differently with other proteins in the bird\u2019s cells. That, in turn, might trigger a cascade of messaging, which would allow the bird to \u201csense\u201d the magnetic field."

      "text": ": Which is one more piece of evidence that the cryptochrome protein might underpin the robins\u2019 magnetic sense. The findings appear in the journal Nature. [Jingjing Xu et al., Magnetic sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a migratory songbird] This experiment only tested the proteins outside birds\u2019 eyes. Someday\u00a0the scientists hope it might be possible to measure this effect inside the animals themselves\u2014to get a truly bird\u2019s-eye view.\u00a0 [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]"
