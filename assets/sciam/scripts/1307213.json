Just a little too much can send a cannabis user spinning out in the opposite direction. Recreational users sometimes call this acute anxiety and panic \u201cparanoia,\u201d and it\u2019s a common complaint from people seeking emergency care for cannabis-induced intoxication. New research offers some hope for folks who have trouble finding a relaxing high\u2014and it comes from a surprising source. For Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman: ","text":"Scientific American\u2019s associate news editor Allison Parshall is with me to tell us more about these new findings."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So I hear you\u2019ve got some exciting news for the anxious weed smokers of the world."},{"author":"Allison Parshall: ","text":"Yes!"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What\u2019s this new study all about?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"If you\u2019ve ever smoked too much weed or taken one too many THC gummies, you might be familiar with this side effect that stoners have long called paranoia\u2014just, like, this acute feeling of anxiety and panic, like the world is just collapsing around you and/or everything is bad and terrible, and you kind of just have to ride it out. It\u2019s one of the main things that people complain about when they show up for emergency health care after having taken too much cannabis."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It\u2019s just kind of gnarly. So basically, in the new study, they found that one of the aromatic compounds in weed\u2014basically it\u2019s just there to smell nice; it\u2019s called d-limonene\u2014can actually reduce these anxious side effects and make people have this paranoia reaction less."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"You mentioned in your article for Scientific American that some of the researchers were kind of surprised that this aromatic compound had this effect. Why was that?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"One of the researchers that I talked to\u2014he was the senior researcher; his name was Ryan Vandrey\u2014he was surprised mostly \u2019cause he was coming at it from more of a skeptical perspective. He wasn\u2019t necessarily expecting that these compounds called terpenes, of which d-limonene is one, would actually have a measurable impact, just because they\u2019re present in such small quantities in cannabis. Like, Vandrey estimated that maybe you get d-limonene as 1 percent of the compounds in any given strain; it depends on the strain. There\u2019s just a ton of compounds in cannabis\u2014like, over 500."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"You\u2019d probably have heard of THC and CBD. Those are the ones that are, in the case of THC, making you feel high; in the case of CBD, doing a number of things to your nervous system that might include calming you down a little bit. But then there\u2019s these other ones called terpenes, and those are the ones that smell nice. In the case of d-limonene, it smells kind of citrusy. I can\u2019t relate to smelling citrus in that smell at all."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I feel like terpenes are kind of like coffee or wine tasting notes to me, where I\u2019m like, \u201cSure, if you say so.\u201d I can recognize that there is a bouquet of interesting notes, that it doesn\u2019t all smell the same, but I\u2019m like, \u201cLemon? I don\u2019t know, man.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Some weed sommelier somewhere is like, \u201cOh, this has hints of coffee.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2014kind of all just smells the same to me. One of the things that was so cool about this, at least according to the researchers I talked to, was that this increasing concentration of d-limonene didn\u2019t impact the feeling of the high at all. So you got this really targeted effect: basically as you increase concentrations of d-limonene, this particular terpene, you just see people\u2019s anxious reactions go down, but they aren\u2019t reporting feeling that their high is any less or different. It\u2019s mostly just the anxiety."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What do they think is going on with limonene? What are they thinking the mechanism is there?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Great question. They don\u2019t know [laughs]. But they know that it\u2019s not acting in the same way that the cannabinoids are\u2014the THC and the CBD. And that might be why it\u2019s not impacting the feeling of the high. It seems to be acting on just other circuits in the brain that are governed by neurotransmitters that might include serotonin, dopamine, GABA [gamma-aminobutyric acid]. But those studies were all done in animals, so kind of grain of salt. They don\u2019t really know yet."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I feel like with studies like these, there are lots of people who are probably like, \u201cAwesome, this is exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for. I\u2019m gonna take this news and run with it.\u201d You\u2019ve mentioned some caveats already, but is there anything else that people should know about this research?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I mean, whenever you cover any study, it\u2019s kind of trite to be like, \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d but truly more research is needed."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It is important to note a limitation in the study: that they were giving people concentrations of limonene that far exceed what you would get just from a regular strain of weed from a dispensary. So it was most evident\u2014the effects\u2014when people had a really high dosage of limonene compared to THC. So we\u2019re talking one part limonene to two parts THC, which is just far exceeding what you would get in a normal strain."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So whether or not you would get the maximum potential of this just from getting some strain that claims to be high in limonene from your local dispensary\u2014not super clear. They didn\u2019t pull this idea out of nowhere. There is evidence that shows that d-limonene can have anxiety-reducing properties. These were not necessarily in cannabis contexts. They were done on animals and on people in a couple of different situations, and they showed anxiety-reducing effects\u2014nothing like, probably, taking anxiety medication, but these are present in citrus essential oils, not to get too woo-woo about it. But it\u2019s coming from somewhere."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I think I remember your article mentioning some historical evidence for this, too, or at least some extremely charming anecdata."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"One of the researchers who helped write the study had done this previous survey basically being like, \u201cWe think terpenes could have this effect.\u201d It\u2019s been pretty widely studied, but he did this whole historical background. And I had no idea that\u2014I mean, people have been smoking weed for forever, hemp for forever. So these, like, home-brew remedies for a bad high have been around kind of just as long. Going back to the 10th century you can find people talking about using citrus fruits, or they called them \u201cacid fruit,\u201d to ride out bad highs."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So there\u2019s also folk remedies for lemon rinds, peppercorns and pine nuts that if you chew them, it can help kind of decrease the side effects from a bad high. That just floats around pretty commonly. And lemon rinds, obviously, they\u2019re a big natural source of d-limonene. And then peppercorns and pine nuts also have other terpenes that are present in cannabis. So whether or not this has anything to do with it at all is kind of anyone\u2019s guess. But this has popped up in various parts of the world as a potential remedy."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And one of the quotes I loved from that historical overview, which came from this Scottish toxicologist from the 1800s, he took some cannabis for a toothache in 1848 and then wrote this, and I will not attempt an accent. Okay, here we go: He wrote, \u201cNext morning there was an ordinary appetite, much torpidity, great defect and shortness of memory, extreme apparent protraction of time.... These symptoms lasted until 2 P.M., when they ceased entirely in a few minutes after taking lemonade.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Incredible."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So you should be taking lemonade [laughs]. If you start feeling really paranoid, I don\u2019t know, squeeze a lemon in your mouth or something. This is not scientifically founded, but maybe you\u2019ll placebo yourself into feeling better."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a glass of lemonade."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, exactly."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Can\u2019t do any harm. So I\u2019m really curious: What are some of the other things terpenes are supposed to do, and do we have any research on any of those?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Growers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 claims about terpenes is one of the main reasons why Vandrey said that he really wanted to do this research, because there\u2019s just so many claims about what they can do that are just totally not backed up by empirical evidence. It\u2019s not because they\u2019ve been disproven; it\u2019s just because they haven\u2019t been tested. Growers and retailers love talking about terpenes, and it fits into this idea of the entourage effect theory that some people might\u2019ve heard of. It basically is the idea of the whole of cannabis is more than the sum of its parts."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So you\u2019re getting all [500-plus] of these compounds. They have a synergy; they work together or something like that. And they come together and make an experience that is\u2014usually the subtext is \u201csuperior to,\u201d but you could just say \u201cdifferent from\u201d what you would get if you just took a THC gummy. And terpenes can be a big part of that, even though they\u2019re present in smaller quantities, and they\u2019re not a cannabinoid. We don\u2019t know that this is true."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I mean, we\u2019re talking about 500-plus compounds here\u2014many different ways they can interact with your body and your nervous system and with each other. The researchers I talked to were like, \u201cIt could be, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d It would be very hard to get evidence to show exactly how it works. The researchers who did this study are also looking at some other terpenes: \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-myrcene. They\u2019ve done the \u03b1-pinene study. They haven\u2019t published the results yet or totally analyzed them."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Vandrey did say that they don\u2019t think that it\u2019s gonna have any of the same targeted effects on anxiety, but stay tuned."},{"author":"Feltman ","text":"That\u2019s all for today, folks!

And then peppercorns and pine nuts also have other terpenes that are present in cannabis. So whether or not this has anything to do with it at all is kind of anyone\u2019s guess.
