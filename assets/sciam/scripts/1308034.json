Here\u2019s a little primer for context: DNA is of course the molecule that carries our genetic code. RNA, which is short for ribonucleic acid, is chemically similar to DNA, but it usually comes in a single strand instead of that iconic little double helix. The molecules also serve different biological functions. DNA stays put within the nucleus of our cells, but it sends out strands of RNA with some of its genetic code so those instructions can actually get relayed to the parts of the cell that make proteins. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, which got a nod in last year\u2019s Nobel Prize in this category thanks to its use in COVID vaccines, is the type of RNA that actually carries these protein-coding instructions. MicroRNA helps control gene expression by binding with messenger RNA and keeping it from delivering its protein-production message.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Let\u2019s keep moving right along to the Nobel Prize in Physics, which went to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their work in machine learning. Inspired by the way the human brain uses neurons linked by synapses to retain and recall information, Hopfield designed an artificial neural network in 1982. In our brains, the connections between individual neurons can grow stronger or weaker depending on our thinking patterns, and similarly the nodes in artificial neural networks are trained to associate more strongly with certain other nodes in the system based on patterns learned over time. Hinton used Hopfield\u2019s work as a starting point to create a new neural network of his own. Collectively, their work helped set the stage for modern-day machine learning and basically everything we refer to as artificial intelligence. It\u2019s worth noting that Hinton, often called the \u201cgodfather of AI,\u201d is now a vocal advocate for caution when it comes to the development and application of artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking more about AI \u2014and how it\u2019s factoring into the 2024 election\u2014on this Friday\u2019s episode, so stay tuned for that.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Speaking of AI, it also takes center stage in this year\u2019s Nobel for Chemistry. One half of the prize was awarded last Wednesday to Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google\u2019s AI research subsidiary Google DeepMind, as well as his colleague John Jumper, for their use of artificial intelligence in untangling the mysteries of three-dimensional protein structures. David Baker took the other half of the prize for developing computational tools that allow scientists to design entirely new proteins.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Scientists have understood since the 1960s that the complex 3D shapes of the proteins that make life possible are baked in based on the order of the amino acid building blocks within them. There are a mind-boggling number of theoretical shapes that the strings of amino acids that make up proteins could fold into\u2014if these chains folded randomly, they\u2019d spend more time than our universe has been around just brute-forcing their way into the correct shape. But inside a cell the process can take less than a second. That means amino acid sequences must have folding instructions encoded within them, which means we should be able to figure out the structure of a folded protein based on its building blocks alone. In 2018 DeepMind\u2019s protein-folding model AlphaFold blew existing methods for protein-folding prediction out of the water, but it was still far from perfect. Then in 2020, when Jumper\u2019s contributions to the project yielded a new version called AlphaFold2, the model managed to predict protein shapes with stunning accuracy.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"As for Baker, back in the 90s he designed a computer software called Rosetta\u2014one of those methods that AlphaFold would eventually one-up. But his work took him beyond the quest to understand protein folding. In 2003 he showed that Rosetta could be used to design new proteins with new functions. And a few years ago, inspired by AlphaFold2\u2019s success he added an AI model into the mix and absolutely turbocharged the protein creation process.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for Nobel news this week. Now let\u2019s look into some COVID updates.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"A study published last Wednesday suggests that COVID could up the risk of heart attacks and strokes even years after the infection itself. Using a U.K. dataset of around 250,000 people, researchers found that people who contracted COVID before vaccines became available had more than twice the risk of a heart attack, stroke or death for at least three years afterward, with is as long as they tracked them, with seemingly no decline in risk over time. Hospitalization for COVID drove that increase in risk up even higher. So if you haven\u2019t gotten your latest COVID booster yet, consider this your reminder to get the jab ASAP and get that flu shot while you are at it.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Last Wednesday we had SciAm editor Andrea Thompson on the pod to tell us about the shifting landscape of hurricane season in the wake of the climate crisis. And I wish that episode hadn\u2019t turned out to be quite so topical. Hurricane Milton made landfall later that same day, slamming into the western coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm. At least 19 tornadoes hit the state that day, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and as of the time of this recording on Friday, millions of people remain without power. Though the storm weakened as it made its way across the state, it maintained its hurricane status for long enough to thrash the eastern coast of Florida on its way out into the Atlantic on Thursday.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"While officials say the damage and threat to life was not as extreme as it could have been, Milton was an alarming storm. It marked the third hurricane to make landfall in Florida this season, and the fifth hurricane to make landfall on the Gulf Coast in 2024. That\u2019s pretty close to a record: we\u2019ve only hit five Gulf hurricanes in a year a couple times before, in 2005 and 2020, and we haven\u2019t seen a higher number of storms hit the area since 1886. Milton\u2019s maximum sustained wind speed of 180 mph makes it reportedly the strongest hurricane to hit the Gulf of Mexico this late in the season, and it\u2019s tied for the sixth strongest storm by wind speed ever recorded in the Atlantic basin.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Speaking of Milton, the hurricane meant NASA had to scrub the October 10 launch of its highly anticipated Europa Clipper mission on SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket. Once it launches Europa Clipper will spend about five and a half years making its way to the Jupiter system. The hope is that Clipper will determine the habitability of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, which is thought to have an ocean more than twice the volume of all of Earth\u2019s combined. To protect itself from the high levels of radiation surrounding Jupiter and its moons, Clipper will make 49 quick flybys of Europa to collect information before retreating to process data and send messages back to Earth. The spacecraft\u2019s launch window is open until early November, so hopefully NASA manages to get it off the ground soon.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s science news roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to talk to a physician who is helping her colleagues learn to leave their biases out of their bedside manner. And on Friday we\u2019ll be chatting with SciAm\u2019s own Ben Guarino about how the 2024 election could impact the future of AI\u2014and how AI could influence the outcome of the election.\u00a0\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio.

Here\u2019s a little primer for context: DNA is of course the molecule that carries our genetic code. RNA, which is short for ribonucleic acid, is chemically similar to DNA, but it usually comes in a single strand instead of that iconic little double helix. The molecules also serve different biological functions. DNA stays put within the nucleus of our cells, but it sends out strands of RNA with some of its genetic code so those instructions can actually get relayed to the parts of the cell that make proteins. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, which got a nod in last year\u2019s Nobel Prize in this category thanks to its use in COVID vaccines, is the type of RNA that actually carries these protein-coding instructions. MicroRNA helps control gene expression by binding with messenger RNA and keeping it from delivering its protein-production message."]},{"begin":"123.880","end":"193.400","lines":["Let\u2019s keep moving right along to the Nobel Prize in Physics, which went to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their work in machine learning. Inspired by the way the human brain uses neurons linked by synapses to retain and recall information, Hopfield designed an artificial neural network in 1982. In our brains, the connections between individual neurons can grow stronger or weaker depending on our thinking patterns, and similarly the nodes in artificial neural networks are trained to associate more strongly with certain other nodes in the system based on patterns learned over time. Hinton used Hopfield\u2019s work as a starting point to create a new neural network of his own. Collectively, their work helped set the stage for modern-day machine learning and basically everything we refer to as artificial intelligence. It\u2019s worth noting that Hinton, often called the \u201cgodfather of AI,\u201d is now a vocal advocate for caution when it comes to the development and application of artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking more about AI \u2014and how it\u2019s factoring into the 2024 election\u2014on this Friday\u2019s episode, so stay tuned for that."]},{"begin":"193.400","end":"219.520","lines":["Speaking of AI, it also takes center stage in this year\u2019s Nobel for Chemistry. One half of the prize was awarded last Wednesday to Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google\u2019s AI research subsidiary Google DeepMind, as well as his colleague John Jumper, for their use of artificial intelligence in untangling the mysteries of three-dimensional protein structures. David Baker took the other half of the prize for developing computational tools that allow scientists to design entirely new proteins."]},{"begin":"219.520","end":"282.080","lines":["Scientists have understood since the 1960s that the complex 3D shapes of the proteins that make life possible are baked in based on the order of the amino acid building blocks within them. There are a mind-boggling number of theoretical shapes that the strings of amino acids that make up proteins could fold into\u2014if these chains folded randomly, they\u2019d spend more time than our universe has been around just brute-forcing their way into the correct shape. But inside a cell the process can take less than a second. That means amino acid sequences must have folding instructions encoded within them, which means we should be able to figure out the structure of a folded protein based on its building blocks alone. In 2018 DeepMind\u2019s protein-folding model AlphaFold blew existing methods for protein-folding prediction out of the water, but it was still far from perfect. Then in 2020, when Jumper\u2019s contributions to the project yielded a new version called AlphaFold2, the model managed to predict protein shapes with stunning accuracy."]},{"begin":"282.080","end":"311.240","lines":["As for Baker, back in the 90s he designed a computer software called Rosetta\u2014one of those methods that AlphaFold would eventually one-up. But his work took him beyond the quest to understand protein folding. In 2003 he showed that Rosetta could be used to design new proteins with new functions. And a few years ago, inspired by AlphaFold2\u2019s success he added an AI model into the mix and absolutely turbocharged the protein creation process."]},{"begin":"311.240","end":"315.280","lines":["That\u2019s all for Nobel news this week.

Using a U.K. dataset of around 250,000 people, researchers found that people who contracted COVID before vaccines became available had more than twice the risk of a heart attack, stroke or death for at least three years afterward, with is as long as they tracked them, with seemingly no decline in risk over time. Hospitalization for COVID drove that increase in risk up even higher. So if you haven\u2019t gotten your latest COVID booster yet, consider this your reminder to get the jab ASAP and get that flu shot while you are at it."]},{"begin":"353.640","end":"391.640","lines":["Last Wednesday we had SciAm editor Andrea Thompson on the pod to tell us about the shifting landscape of hurricane season in the wake of the climate crisis. And I wish that episode hadn\u2019t turned out to be quite so topical. Hurricane Milton made landfall later that same day, slamming into the western coast of Florida as a Category 3 storm. At least 19 tornadoes hit the state that day, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and as of the time of this recording on Friday, millions of people remain without power. Though the storm weakened as it made its way across the state, it maintained its hurricane status for long enough to thrash the eastern coast of Florida on its way out into the Atlantic on Thursday."]},{"begin":"391.640","end":"432.400","lines":["While officials say the damage and threat to life was not as extreme as it could have been, Milton was an alarming storm. It marked the third hurricane to make landfall in Florida this season, and the fifth hurricane to make landfall on the Gulf Coast in 2024. That\u2019s pretty close to a record: we\u2019ve only hit five Gulf hurricanes in a year a couple times before, in 2005 and 2020, and we haven\u2019t seen a higher number of storms hit the area since 1886. Milton\u2019s maximum sustained wind speed of 180 mph makes it reportedly the strongest hurricane to hit the Gulf of Mexico this late in the season, and it\u2019s tied for the sixth strongest storm by wind speed ever recorded in the Atlantic basin."]},{"begin":"432.400","end":"474.080","lines":["Speaking of Milton, the hurricane meant NASA had to scrub the October 10 launch of its highly anticipated Europa Clipper mission on SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket.

The hope is that Clipper will determine the habitability of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, which is thought to have an ocean more than twice the volume of all of Earth\u2019s combined. To protect itself from the high levels of radiation surrounding Jupiter and its moons, Clipper will make 49 quick flybys of Europa to collect information before retreating to process data and send messages back to Earth.
