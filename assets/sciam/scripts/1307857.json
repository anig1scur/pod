Let\u2019s lean into those new school year vibes by learning a little something. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman\u2014and this is your weekly science news roundup. First, some good news for anyone glued to their phone, which\u2014I mean, if you\u2019re not, congratulations, I guess. A new paper offers reassurance that cell phones don\u2019t give you brain cancer, which is great, phew\u2026. So, how did we get here? Back in 2011, the World Health Organization\u2019s cancer research agency classified mobile phone radiation as possibly carcinogenic. That's a category that means there's limited evidence that something could possibly raise cancer risk, but it's far from definitive. You know what else falls into that category? So-called traditional Asian pickled vegetables. And listen, if eating pickled daikon is how I go, so be it. The point is that a few studies suggesting something might potentially be carcinogenic can get something put on this list, and it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to throw the kimchi out with the bathwater. But unsurprisingly, the idea that cell phones might cause cancer was scary enough\u2014and universally applicable enough because, again, we\u2019re all glued to our phones\u2014for advocacy groups, headlines, and even some regulators to latch onto. In a new review led by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and commissioned by the WHO researchers sifted through about 5,100 studies on the subject and they found just 63 that satisfied their criteria for inclusion. When they looked at those, the researchers said: there was no apparent link between phone use and brain and head cancers. We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on things as technology evolves, of course, and the same group is now exploring cancers less obviously linkable to cell phone use, such as leukemia, to make sure there\u2019s no link there, either. And of course, phones don\u2019t have to give you cancer to be bad for you. Last week, Sweden\u2019s public health authority\u2014which has a name I won\u2019t even try to pronounce, you\u2019re welcome\u2014issued new recommendations on how parents should regulate screen time, and the guidelines are harsh.  They say that kids under the age of two shouldn\u2019t be exposed to any screens at all, two to five year olds should stick to an hour or less, and teens should max out at three hours a day, not including school work. That\u2019s actually not too different from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 guidelines, though the U.S. organization grants that children under two years old should be able to video chat with adult supervision and says 18-to-24-month-olds can enjoy educational programming in the presence of a caregiver. While these sorts of guidelines include screens of all kinds, internet-connected devices, and particularly phones, are often the focus. Earlier this year, a study commissioned by the President of France concluded that no child under the age of 11 should have a phone of any kind, no kid under the age of 13 should have a smartphone, and those 15 and older should only be allowed on \"ethical\" social media sites, rather than profit-driven platforms such as TikTok and Snapchat. That same report said that children under three should be kept away from screens if possible. According to a translation by The Guardian, that\u2019s to protect them from the \u201cstrategy of capturing children\u2019s attention, using all forms of cognitive bias to shut children away on their screens, control them, re-engage them and monetise them\u201d and turn them into \u201cmerchandise.\u201d [Clip: Music] Speaking of protecting kids, Oregon\u2019s latest measles outbreak is officially the state\u2019s worst one in three decades. Numbers are also rising nationwide, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting 236 cases so far this year compared with just 59 cases in all of 2023. Health experts say that falling vaccination rates are the clear and avoidable cause. Non-medical vaccine exemption rates for kindergartners in Oregon have risen from about 1% to 8.8% since 2000. When it comes to measles specifically, as of the 2022-2023 school year, the nationwide vaccination rate for kindergarteners was just over 93%\u2014that\u2019s almost 2 percentage points lower than the threshold for herd immunity, which would help prevent the spread of measles. [CLIP: Music] Measles is incredibly contagious, and can cause lifelong health issues and even death. So make sure your kids are vaccinated! Now is the perfect time to go get your flu shot, too\u2014and if you haven\u2019t had COVID in the last few months, throw in that new booster in while you\u2019re at it. And now for something completely different: As Welcome to Night Vale\u2019s Cecil Palmer once said, \u201cThere is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful, and that line is covered in jellyfish.\u201d Adorable, troubling, fascinating, deeply unsettling: all of these adjectives could easily describe the invasive freshwater jellyfish multiplying in lakes, ponds and quarries in British Columbia, Canada, especially because the species is commonly known as the \u201cpeach blossom jellyfish,\u201d which is just too cute. Like, literally, too cute for an invasive species. Come on\u2013make them easier to hate. Last month, a paper in the Canadian Journal of Zoology predicted that climate change will likely extend this invader\u2019s range. It also confirmed that all 100 jellyfish sampled shared the same genetic material\u2014in other words, they\u2019re essentially clones formed from one single prolific polyp or polyp cluster. As one of the researchers explained, polyps are tiny and hard to spot, one of the researchers explained, which means there could be ticking jellyfish timebombs lurking in lakes we haven\u2019t even begun to worry about yet. The one upside is that these all-male clones won\u2019t get the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction, which means they\u2019ll be way less likely to adapt to new environments. These jellyfish have never been reported to sting humans, probably because their stinging cells are designed to paralyze wee little zooplankton and seem unable to pierce human skin. But there\u2019s some concern that they might start outcompeting local species, including young salmon, when it comes to finding food. Now I\u2019ll give you all a little space. [CLIP: Music] You may have seen headlines about a mysterious pulsing noise coming out of a speaker on the ill-fated Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which brought astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams up to the International Space Station but will not be bringing them back down. Last week NASA confirmed that this was just feedback resulting from the audio connection between Starliner and the space station. NASA emphasized that this is a common occurrence, caused no risk to the crew, and that it\u2019s standard procedure for astronauts to report sounds like this to mission control. The subtext is definitely that NASA knows we\u2019re all laser focused on everything that might possibly be going wrong with Starliner, you know, the spacecraft that definitely-did-not-strand two astronauts in space for months longer than intended, and they would like us to please find something else to talk about. But speaking of Starliner, at least one last time, NASA has officially started prepping to send the spacecraft back to Earth without a crew. At the time of this recording, the space agency was hoping to see Starliner undock at 6:04 p.m. Eastern on Friday, September 6. Did it land in White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico, about six hours later? Hopefully. But maybe the weather didn\u2019t cooperate and they had to postpone, or something else went wrong. I\u2019m not going to make the podcast team work over the weekend for this, so it\u2019s kind of a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Starliner situation. (Also, that\u2019s a joke, so please don\u2019t email me explaining how this isn\u2019t at all like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. Email me about literally anything else\u2013I would love to hear from you.) That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup. But if you need more space\u2013okay, fine\u2013tune in again on Friday for a conversation with someone who\u2019s actually up there right now. And in the meantime, we\u2019ll be back on Wednesday with a look at how the events of 9/11 changed the field of forensic science.

September, listeners! Let\u2019s lean into those new school year vibes by learning a little something. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman\u2014and this is your weekly science news roundup. First, some good news for anyone glued to their phone, which\u2014I mean, if you\u2019re not, congratulations, I guess. A new paper offers reassurance that cell phones don\u2019t give you brain cancer, which is great, phew\u2026. So, how did we get here? Back in 2011, the World Health Organization\u2019s cancer research agency classified mobile phone radiation as possibly carcinogenic. That's a category that means there's limited evidence that something could possibly raise cancer risk, but it's far from definitive. You know what else falls into that category? So-called traditional Asian pickled vegetables. And listen, if eating pickled daikon is how I go, so be it. The point is that a few studies suggesting something might potentially be carcinogenic can get something put on this list, and it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to throw the kimchi out with the bathwater. But unsurprisingly, the idea that cell phones might cause cancer was scary enough\u2014and universally applicable enough because, again, we\u2019re all glued to our phones\u2014for advocacy groups, headlines, and even some regulators to latch onto. In a new review led by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and commissioned by the WHO researchers sifted through about 5,100 studies on the subject and they found just 63 that satisfied their criteria for inclusion. When they looked at those, the researchers said: there was no apparent link between phone use and brain and head cancers. We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on things as technology evolves, of course, and the same group is now exploring cancers less obviously linkable to cell phone use, such as leukemia, to make sure there\u2019s no link there, either. And of course, phones don\u2019t have to give you cancer to be bad for you. Last week, Sweden\u2019s public health authority\u2014which has a name I won\u2019t even try to pronounce, you\u2019re welcome\u2014issued new recommendations on how parents should regulate screen time, and the guidelines are harsh.  They say that kids under the age of two shouldn\u2019t be exposed to any screens at all, two to five year olds should stick to an hour or less, and teens should max out at three hours a day, not including school work. That\u2019s actually not too different from the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 guidelines, though the U.S. organization grants that children under two years old should be able to video chat with adult supervision and says 18-to-24-month-olds can enjoy educational programming in the presence of a caregiver. While these sorts of guidelines include screens of all kinds, internet-connected devices, and particularly phones, are often the focus. Earlier this year, a study commissioned by the President of France concluded that no child under the age of 11 should have a phone of any kind, no kid under the age of 13 should have a smartphone, and those 15 and older should only be allowed on \"ethical\" social media sites, rather than profit-driven platforms such as TikTok and Snapchat. That same report said that children under three should be kept away from screens if possible. According to a translation by The Guardian, that\u2019s to protect them from the \u201cstrategy of capturing children\u2019s attention, using all forms of cognitive bias to shut children away on their screens, control them, re-engage them and monetise them\u201d and turn them into \u201cmerchandise.\u201d [Clip: Music] Speaking of protecting kids, Oregon\u2019s latest measles outbreak is officially the state\u2019s worst one in three decades. Numbers are also rising nationwide, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting 236 cases so far this year compared with just 59 cases in all of 2023. Health experts say that falling vaccination rates are the clear and avoidable cause. Non-medical vaccine exemption rates for kindergartners in Oregon have risen from about 1% to 8.8% since 2000. When it comes to measles specifically, as of the 2022-2023 school year, the nationwide vaccination rate for kindergarteners was just over 93%\u2014that\u2019s almost 2 percentage points lower than the threshold for herd immunity, which would help prevent the spread of measles. [CLIP: Music] Measles is incredibly contagious, and can cause lifelong health issues and even death. So make sure your kids are vaccinated! Now is the perfect time to go get your flu shot, too\u2014and if you haven\u2019t had COVID in the last few months, throw in that new booster in while you\u2019re at it. And now for something completely different: As Welcome to Night Vale\u2019s Cecil Palmer once said, \u201cThere is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful, and that line is covered in jellyfish.\u201d Adorable, troubling, fascinating, deeply unsettling: all of these adjectives could easily describe the invasive freshwater jellyfish multiplying in lakes, ponds and quarries in British Columbia, Canada, especially because the species is commonly known as the \u201cpeach blossom jellyfish,\u201d which is just too cute. Like, literally, too cute for an invasive species. Come on\u2013make them easier to hate. Last month, a paper in the Canadian Journal of Zoology predicted that climate change will likely extend this invader\u2019s range. It also confirmed that all 100 jellyfish sampled shared the same genetic material\u2014in other words, they\u2019re essentially clones formed from one single prolific polyp or polyp cluster. As one of the researchers explained, polyps are tiny and hard to spot, one of the researchers explained, which means there could be ticking jellyfish timebombs lurking in lakes we haven\u2019t even begun to worry about yet. The one upside is that these all-male clones won\u2019t get the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction, which means they\u2019ll be way less likely to adapt to new environments. These jellyfish have never been reported to sting humans, probably because their stinging cells are designed to paralyze wee little zooplankton and seem unable to pierce human skin. But there\u2019s some concern that they might start outcompeting local species, including young salmon, when it comes to finding food. Now I\u2019ll give you all a little space. [CLIP: Music] You may have seen headlines about a mysterious pulsing noise coming out of a speaker on the ill-fated Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which brought astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams up to the International Space Station but will not be bringing them back down. Last week NASA confirmed that this was just feedback resulting from the audio connection between Starliner and the space station. NASA emphasized that this is a common occurrence, caused no risk to the crew, and that it\u2019s standard procedure for astronauts to report sounds like this to mission control. The subtext is definitely that NASA knows we\u2019re all laser focused on everything that might possibly be going wrong with Starliner, you know, the spacecraft that definitely-did-not-strand two astronauts in space for months longer than intended, and they would like us to please find something else to talk about. But speaking of Starliner, at least one last time, NASA has officially started prepping to send the spacecraft back to Earth without a crew. At the time of this recording, the space agency was hoping to see Starliner undock at 6:04 p.m. Eastern on Friday, September 6. Did it land in White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico, about six hours later? Hopefully. But maybe the weather didn\u2019t cooperate and they had to postpone, or something else went wrong. I\u2019m not going to make the podcast team work over the weekend for this, so it\u2019s kind of a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Starliner situation. (Also, that\u2019s a joke, so please don\u2019t email me explaining how this isn\u2019t at all like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. Email me about literally anything else\u2013I would love to hear from you.) That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup. But if you need more space\u2013okay, fine\u2013tune in again on Friday for a conversation with someone who\u2019s actually up there right now. And in the meantime, we\u2019ll be back on Wednesday with a look at how the events of 9/11 changed the field of forensic science.
