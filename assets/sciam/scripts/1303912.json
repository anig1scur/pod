And he thought maybe a fine spider web or spider silk could act as a sound sensor."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"To find out, the researchers coaxed a spider into giving them a bit of silk\u2026"},{"author":"Miles","text":"\u2026 and we played sound at a little strand of spider silk and found that when the silk is very thin, it moves with the air in a sound field amazingly well\u2026 over a wide range of frequencies, from 1 hz to 50 khz. So we knew then that the spider silk was sort of an ideal, perfect sound sensor."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That was eye-opening for the researchers\u2026but is it ear-tickling for the spiders?"},{"author":"Miles","text":"So we set out to try to figure out if the spiders were actually able to hear sound using their web. And this was a hard question to answer."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"For one thing, they had to find a way to get a whole web into the special soundproof chamber in the basement of the lab building."},{"author":"Miles","text":"You know, spider webs are very delicate. You can\u2019t go out in the woods and find a spider web and grab it and take it home. It\u2019s attached to things. And it\u2019s not easy to get it intact."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Especially those made by the industrious orb-weavers\u2026spiders like the title character in Charlotte\u2019s Web."},{"author":"Hoy","text":"We\u2019re talking about quite a spectacular web. It\u2019s this wheel-shaped web that is around upstate New York\u2026if you walk through any field, you\u2019ve either gonna walk through one or you\u2019re gonna see it and avoid it because they\u2019re big. It can get as big as a yard or a meter across."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So Jian Zhou and fellow student Junpeng Lai came up with a way to get custom-made webs custom to go."},{"author":"Miles","text":"What they did is make a little wooden frame\u2026 kind of the size of a decent sized picture frame\u2026and they placed this frame on the windows of our building."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"The lights in the building attracted bugs\u2026and the bugs attracted spiders."},{"author":"Miles","text":"So\u2026the spiders built their webs on the frames. Then in the morning, my students would go and collect the frames and basically hijack the spiders and take them over and put the frame in the\u2026chamber intact."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Now, how can you tell whether a web functions as an arachnid hearing aid? One way is to keep an eye on the spider\u2019s brain."},{"author":"Hoy","text":"My lab, the neurophysiologists, made some recordings from the nervous system sensory system that showed that indeed you get an acoustic response in the nerves to sound\u2026coming from a speaker a little more than a meter away."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"But even more revealing was how the spiders acted."},{"author":"Hoy","text":"To very loud sounds, you could get a strong response\u2026the spider would either flatten out or it might actually crouch. But it\u2019s really hunkering down. That is indicative [to a biologist] of an alarm response."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"And when serenaded with sounds that are maybe 10 decibels or 100 times softer\u2026"},{"author":"Hoy","text":"Without changing its body posture or making any other movements, it might simply raise its front two legs off of the web."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That leg lift, says Hoy\u2026"},{"author":"Hoy","text":"\u2026is a spider\u2019s way of maybe putting two more sensors out there to see what\u2019s coming. We don\u2019t know that yet. But that response to a very soft stimulus might be simply the spider\u2019s reaction to, \u201cI know something\u2019s out there, I heard it, but I need more information.\u201d So\u2026that\u2019s essentially the demonstration that was needed to show that spiders can hear sound."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"This filamentous approach to acoustics could someday change the way we make microphones\u2026and take webcasting to a whole new level.
