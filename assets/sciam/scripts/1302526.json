    "A fossil bed in Patagonia provides evidence of complex social structure in dinosaurs as early as 193 million years ago. And scientists say that herding behavior could have been key to the beasts\u2019\u00a0success."

      "text": "This is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. I'm Christopher Intagliata. Just as cows, sheep and bison roam in herds today, so, too, did plant-eating dinosaurs. And it appears they began flocking together much earlier than we used to think\u2014just as the Jurassic period began to unfold."

And the fossils preserved there\u2014an array of nearly 200 specimens of a plant\u00a0eater named Mussaurus patagonicus\u2014provide a snapshot of the dinosaur at all stages of its life. Eggs and hatchlings, clumps of juveniles\u00a0and then\u2014further out\u2014adults."

      "text": "So this kind of undisturbed distribution of fossils and this kind of age segregation basically shows these dinosaurs had a social structure. They lived in a colony. And everybody has got things to do\u2014duties\u2014with respect to the young and the juveniles."

      "text": "The study\u2014in the journal Scientific Reports\u2014suggests dinosaurs developed complex social behavior 40 million years earlier than previously thought. And Ramezani says the work also advances long-standing questions about the social structure of dinosaurs.\u00a0[Diego Pol et al., Earliest evidence of herd-living and age segregation amongst dinosaurs]"
