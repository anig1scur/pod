For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Let\u2019s kick off the week with our usual science news roundup."},{"author":"","text":"First, a quick note about measles, which is still spreading in West Texas and has also cropped up in smaller numbers in eight other states. In an op-ed for Fox News published on March 2, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arguably downplayed the importance of vaccines, saying the MMR jab provides protection against measles while also calling vaccination a \"personal choice.\" He also claimed that vitamin A supplementation has been shown to \u201cdramatically reduce measles mortality.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"Since the publication of that op-ed, many experts have sounded the alarm on that plug for vitamin A. The research RFK Jr. referenced does exist, but there\u2019s important context missing. The analysis he cited focuses on studies that mostly looked at low-income countries where many people have vitamin A deficiencies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s most recent data, less than 1 percent of people in the U.S. have vitamin A deficiencies."},{"author":"","text":"Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, told the Washington Post that vitamin A can play a role in treating children who are hospitalized with measles. But he and other experts conveyed concerns to the Washington Post about RFK Jr.\u2019s framing creating a false equivalency between vaccination, which is an extremely effective way to prevent measles, and vitamin supplementation, which may or may not help children avoid complications from measles. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently put out a statement emphasizing that vitamin A supplementation is no substitute for vaccination and that it should only be conducted under the supervision of a medical professional. Vitamin A overdoses can cause bone fractures, liver damage and other serious issues."},{"author":"","text":"Now let\u2019s move on to a somewhat complex environmental ruling from the Supreme Court. The headline here is that in a 5-4 ruling last Tuesday, the justices sided with the city of San Francisco against the Environmental Protection Agency, weakening the agency\u2019s ability to regulate pollution of the nation\u2019s waterways."},{"author":"","text":"Basically, San Francisco argued that the EPA was too vague in a permit governing the city\u2019s release of sewage into the Pacific Ocean when extreme rainfall overwhelms a water-treatment facility. The permit tasks San Francisco with ensuring its wastewater discharge doesn\u2019t cause the ocean to dip below \u201cany applicable water quality standard,\u201d but the city said that wasn\u2019t enough information. Instead, San Francisco officials wanted the EPA to lay out exactly how much discharge was okay. During oral arguments, an EPA attorney said the agency only used those broad requirements because San Francisco wouldn\u2019t provide the information needed to set specific dumping rules\u2014a claim the city of course refuted."},{"author":"","text":"The majority decision, penned by Justice Samuel Alito, concluded that the EPA exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act by imposing the water quality requirements, which the ruling calls \u201cend-result\u201d provisions. With these provisions out of the picture, the onus will be on the EPA to figure out what cities\u2014and other entities that dump sewage\u2014need to do to keep their local surface water clean."},{"author":"","text":"Back in October the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution urging the city\u2019s Public Utilities Commission to drop or settle its issues with the EPA ahead of oral arguments in the Supreme Court case, they argued that a win could weaken the agency\u2019s ability to curb pollution\u2014which would in turn put a real dent in San Francisco\u2019s reputation as a green city."},{"author":"","text":"In other environmental news, a study published last Wednesday in Nature offers some uplifting findings on the ozone layer. As you probably already know, back in the 1980s scientists detected an area over the South Pole where our atmosphere\u2019s ozone layer, which helps protect the planet from the sun\u2019s UV rays, had gotten thinner. This turned out to be due to chlorofluorocarbons and other similar human made chemicals. An international treaty called the Montreal Protocol, which went into effect in 1989, was aimed at phasing out the use of those substances. Data in recent years has shown that the ozone layer is recovering, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA projecting it could return to normal by 2066."},{"author":"","text":"For the first time scientists have shown with confidence that the Montreal Protocol is indeed to thank for this incredible comeback. That\u2019s great news; if some of the ozone layer\u2019s recovery were due to uncontrollable factors like weather patterns, then we\u2019d have to worry that we might lose some of our progress if those conditions shifted."},{"author":"","text":"In the new study researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology created simulations of the atmosphere under different conditions. Some of their simulations showed a world without an increase in greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, which helped them understand how the ozone layer might fluctuate without our interference. The researchers say we can now be quite sure that the ozone layer is healing because we\u2019ve stopped using the chemicals that hurt it, which is a great reminder that we really can combat climate change and other human-driven environmental issues if we band together."},{"author":"","text":"Speaking of humans doing stuff that doesn\u2019t suck for once, another study published last Wednesday offers hope for people dealing with osteoarthritis. And that hope stems from a somewhat surprising source: your septum."},{"author":"","text":"Generally ignored unless they\u2019re deviated or pierced, septums are also a great spot for grabbing a bit of cartilage without super-invasive surgery. Nasal cartilage cells also seem particularly good at fighting inflammation. A group of scientists have been working on a method of using cartilage implants grown from itty-bitty septum samples to repair knee injuries for a number of years now. What\u2019s new in the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, is that the researchers compared outcomes between people whose cartilage grafts were grown in the lab for the standard couple of days before insertion with people whose grafts spent a couple of weeks maturing instead. The clinical trial was small, involving just around 100 people. But the results do suggest that, when allowed to mature, these septum-grown grafts do a better job of fixing the injury in question\u2014and they can actually lead to improvement in the health of surrounding cartilage, too. The team is about to undertake two large clinical studies on the use of this cartilage technique in treating osteoarthritis in the kneecaps."},{"author":"","text":"Last but not least we\u2019ve simply got to talk about woolly mammoth mice. Woolly mammice? Woolly mousemoths? Whatever."},{"author":"","text":"Biotech company Colossal Biosciences, primarily known for its mission to bring the woolly mammoth and dodo back from extinction with the help of genetic engineering, announced last Tuesday that the team edited several different genes in mice embryos to make them\u2014well, woolly."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s important to note, however, that these mice didn\u2019t have woolly mammoth genes inserted into their genomes. Most of the edits involved tweaking mouse genes that prior research has shown dictate hair traits such as color and texture. But Colossal also looked at ancient mammoth DNA to find genes tied to hair pattern and fat metabolism and adjusted the corresponding mice genes. The result was some real Tribble-esque rodents. The company says this is a step toward doing something similar in Asian elephants, which are woolly mammoth\u2019s closest living relatives. But in interviews with the Associated Press several experts pointed out that making an elephant woolier isn\u2019t the same as bringing woolly mammoths back from extinction. Another expert pointed out to the Guardian that this money could perhaps be better spent preventing the extinction of the animals living on Earth right now, which is tough but fair. Those hairy little mice are very cute, though."},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday."},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Naeem Amarsy and Jeff DelViscio.

In an op-ed for Fox News published on March 2, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

As you probably already know, back in the 1980s scientists detected an area over the South Pole where our atmosphere\u2019s ozone layer, which helps protect the planet from the sun\u2019s UV rays, had gotten thinner. This turned out to be due to chlorofluorocarbons and other similar human made chemicals. An international treaty called the Montreal Protocol, which went into effect in 1989, was aimed at phasing out the use of those substances. Data in recent years has shown that the ozone layer is recovering, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA projecting it could return to normal by 2066."]},{"begin":"313.920","end":"332.720","lines":["For the first time scientists have shown with confidence that the Montreal Protocol is indeed to thank for this incredible comeback.

What\u2019s new in the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, is that the researchers compared outcomes between people whose cartilage grafts were grown in the lab for the standard couple of days before insertion with people whose grafts spent a couple of weeks maturing instead. The clinical trial was small, involving just around 100 people. But the results do suggest that, when allowed to mature, these septum-grown grafts do a better job of fixing the injury in question\u2014and they can actually lead to improvement in the health of surrounding cartilage, too.

But in interviews with the Associated Press several experts pointed out that making an elephant woolier isn\u2019t the same as bringing woolly mammoths back from extinction.
