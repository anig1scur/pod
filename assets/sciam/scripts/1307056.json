So I\u2019m going to rectify that right now."

      "text": "So the fundamental idea behind Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle is that there is a limit on how well we can simultaneously measure the position of an object, so where something is, and its momentum. Which we can roughly say is, in some sense, a measure of its velocity, so how fast it\u2019s going in what direction. There\u2019s also a mass in there, but we don\u2019t need to worry about that. And there\u2019s actually also another uncertainty relation between energy and time about how well you can simultaneously measure the energy of an object and the time over which the system is changing."

Students are still memorizing these equations because they work remarkably well in most situations. But then Albert Einstein came along and said that no, no, that\u2019s not quite right. I\u2019m going to totally oversimplify here, but this came about because Newton\u2019s ideas work great in normal situations we encounter here in everyday life, but they break down around black holes and near the speed of light.

Scientists who publish splashy, novel results get rewarded with tenure and media attention and grants, but a lot of these findings don\u2019t hold up over time, and the attention-grabbing results may not be as important long-term as slower, more incremental research.

The difference is that if we think of science as the purveyor of facts, then we assume that when a scientist tells us, \u201cThis is what we found,\u201d that it\u2019s true. The idea of science as uncertainty reduction is to say, here\u2019s the evidence that I have right now. Here\u2019s how I think we can understand that. Here\u2019s how I would explain it. And we\u2019ll see if it survives as others look at that [and] interrogate the evidence that I provided or acquire new evidence that they come up with or generate an explanation that I hadn\u2019t thought of for the claims that I\u2019m making for my evidence."

What I disagree with is its link to the explanation.\u201d And then we don\u2019t have an easy way to resolve that except for then trying to design studies where we see your explanation might anticipate outcome A [and] my explanation would anticipate outcome B.
