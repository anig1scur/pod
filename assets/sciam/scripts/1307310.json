It\u2019s Kelso Harper, multimedia editor here at Scientific American. I\u2019m filling in for our esteemed host Rachel Feltman while she takes a well-deserved break. But don\u2019t worry\u2014she\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to talk about a culinary delicacy that may take you by surprise: cicadas. But for now, it\u2019s time to catch up on some science news! For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Kelso Harper. [Clip: Show theme music] Alrighty, let\u2019s kick off Pride Month by remembering one of our favorite queer science heroes."},{"author":"Kelso Harper","text":"This Friday marks 70 years since, well, the rather sad and untimely death of British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing is now famous for leading the effort to decrypt Nazi coded messages during World War II and is often called one of the fathers of modern computing. You may remember him being played by none other than Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game, which came out\u2014almost 10 years ago? Wow, time really flies. [Clip: The Imitation Game]"},{"author":"Benedict Cumberbatch: ","text":"It turns out that\u2019s the only German you need to know to break enigma."},{"author":"Harper","text":"Unfortunately, Turing didn\u2019t receive any of this recognition during his lifetime. He, unfortunately, died in disgrace and was brutally punished for his sexuality and didn\u2019t receive a formal pardon until 2013. But, on a lighter note Turing was once quoted as saying something quite lovely, which \u201cOne day ladies will take their computers for walks in the park and tell each other, \u2018My little computer said such a funny thing this morning!\u2019\u201d So we have to imagine he\u2019d feel pretty vindicated by our last news episode about the hilariously creepy antics of the latest OpenAI model."},{"author":"Harper","text":"Also, I just said that in the park the other day, how did he know? Speaking of taking our funny little computers out for walks, despite the widespread belief that our phones inflict psychological damage on us, a new study found that we sure love using them anyway. More specifically the study looked at how smartphone usage changed the moods of teenage participants. As smartphone ownership and use have gone up among teens, so have rates of depression and other mood disorders."},{"author":"Harper","text":"Many suspect this isn\u2019t a coincidence, but previous research on the subject had largely been inconclusive or produced conflicting results. So, this new study found that teens reported better moods while using their phones and said that their moods improved from their phone usage. The researchers were quick to point out that these findings aren\u2019t necessarily inconsistent with the theory that phones contribute to depression, anxiety and other issues in teens, and while using your phone as a mood-boosting tool can go awry, for some teens, it may actually be a fairly innocuous and even healthy way of self-soothing."},{"author":"Harper","text":"In other tech news, last Thursday a new paper examined the impact of not-quite-misinformation on social media. You\u2019ve probably heard a lot about misinformation and all the dangers it poses, and you\u2019ve likely seen various social platforms flag some content as containing misinformation. But in this new study researchers looked at stories that weren\u2019t technically false but were framed in a misleading way."},{"author":"Harper","text":"For example, one story the researchers tracked was published in the Chicago Tribune in 2021 with the headline: \u201cA \u2018healthy\u2019 doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why.\u201d While it was true that a doctor died during that time frame after getting vaccinated, there was absolutely no evidence to suggest their death was related to the vaccination\u2014let alone that this provided proof of some larger issues with COVID vaccines. The researchers found that misleadingly factual information like this was 46 times more consequential for driving vaccine hesitancy than content flagged as misinformation."},{"author":"Harper","text":"Figuring out how to combat misleading and incorrect information about public health should be a top priority right now because we\u2019ve got plenty of contagions to keep an eye on. While the CDC is no longer requiring hospitals to report their COVID data, California\u2019s Department of Public Health says cases appear to be slowly rising in the state. Australia has also reported an uptick in cases. Let\u2019s all try to remember that even mild cases of COVID can leave people with debilitating long-term symptoms."},{"author":"Harper","text":"So don\u2019t forget to stay home if you feel sick, wear a mask in crowded settings and test yourself as needed. On the bird flu front\u2014and, yes, unfortunately that is also still a thing. In late May the CDC said that while the risk of cow-to-human transmission of H5N1 is considered low, the agency is preparing for \u201cdevelopments that could increase the risk to human health,\u201d noting that three human cases have now been confirmed\u2014including one that involved upper respiratory symptoms."},{"author":"Harper","text":"The virus causing the current bird flu outbreak recently showed up in beef for the first time too, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture says cooking meat to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit will kill the virus. But maybe just lay off the steak tartare for now. And in case our last report on the dangers of raw milk didn\u2019t persuade you, a new study found that drinking unpasteurized milk infected with H5N1 led to quick-onset flu symptoms in lab mice. So, cook your cow products, folk!"},{"author":"Harper","text":"Okay, let\u2019s end with something a little brighter: if you missed those wildly bright auroral displays a few weeks back because of cloudy skies like me (I\u2019m still devastated), you might just be in luck. Those incredible light shows occurred when several solar flares and so-called coronal mass ejections hit us at the same time, creating a powerful solar storm. And that part of the sun that was filled with sunspots, rotated out of our sight in the days that followed, but now it\u2019s coming back around."},{"author":"Harper","text":"In fact, it should be facing us during the new moon on Thursday\u2014which will provide the same extra-dark skies that helped make last month\u2019s solar storm so very magical\u2026for everyone who saw it, which was not me, but it\u2019s ok! We can\u2019t know for sure that we\u2019ll get hit with enough space weather for auroras to venture as far from the poles as they did last time. But keep an eye out for reports of solar storms this week and try to get yourself to an area without clouds or light pollution if you can!"},{"author":"Harper","text":"I certainly will be making a run for it. And that is it for this week\u2019s news roundup. Rachel will be back on Wednesday with that surprisingly delicious story about cicadas. And don\u2019t forget to tune in on Friday for the last episode in our latest Fascination series, which is all about Cape Cod\u2019s \u201cnumber one\u201d problem. Get it? Well, if not, you should go listen to the last two Friday episodes to get up to speed on how a \u201cyellow tide\u201d is turning the waters of Cape Cod green. Also, before you go, we want to hear from you!"},{"author":"Harper","text":"How do you like the new episode formats? Are there any stories or subjects you\u2019d like us to cover? E-mail us any of your thoughts or ideas at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. Seriously, we read them. I read them personally! And I really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

You can get more in your inbox by signing up for our newsletter, Today in Science, or any of our weekly newsletter roundups if you don\u2019t want an email every day (even though it\u2019s a great email)."},{"author":"Harper","text":"You can also find us on basically all of the things\u2014Instagram, TikTok, X, Reddit, YouTube, etcetera, etcetera\u2014but you\u2019ll really get everything by heading to ScientificAmerican.com. Plus, if you, like me, get tired of staring at a screen all day, we still publish a gorgeous, three-dimensional magazine chock-full of knowledge almost every month. Eleven months out of the year! I read it with my coffee in the morning, and it\u2019s a glorious experience. And I feel very fancy when I carry it around with me, so I\u2019m just throwing that out there. Thanks for tuning in to this week\u2019s news roundup!"},{"author":"Harper","text":"I\u2019ll catch you next time Rachel needs a breather.

He, unfortunately, died in disgrace and was brutally punished for his sexuality and didn\u2019t receive a formal pardon until 2013. But, on a lighter note Turing was once quoted as saying something quite lovely, which \u201cOne day ladies will take their computers for walks in the park and tell each other, \u2018My little computer said such a funny thing this morning!\u2019\u201d So we have to imagine he\u2019d feel pretty vindicated by our last news episode about the hilariously creepy antics of the latest OpenAI model."]},{"begin":"152.320","end":"179.160","lines":["Also, I just said that in the park the other day, how did he know? Speaking of taking our funny little computers out for walks, despite the widespread belief that our phones inflict psychological damage on us, a new study found that we sure love using them anyway. More specifically the study looked at how smartphone usage changed the moods of teenage participants. As smartphone ownership and use have gone up among teens, so have rates of depression and other mood disorders."]},{"begin":"179.160","end":"213.240","lines":["Many suspect this isn\u2019t a coincidence, but previous research on the subject had largely been inconclusive or produced conflicting results. So, this new study found that teens reported better moods while using their phones and said that their moods improved from their phone usage. The researchers were quick to point out that these findings aren\u2019t necessarily inconsistent with the theory that phones contribute to depression, anxiety and other issues in teens, and while using your phone as a mood-boosting tool can go awry, for some teens, it may actually be a fairly innocuous and even healthy way of self-soothing."]},{"begin":"213.240","end":"237.040","lines":["In other tech news, last Thursday a new paper examined the impact of not-quite-misinformation on social media. You\u2019ve probably heard a lot about misinformation and all the dangers it poses, and you\u2019ve likely seen various social platforms flag some content as containing misinformation.

The researchers found that misleadingly factual information like this was 46 times more consequential for driving vaccine hesitancy than content flagged as misinformation."]},{"begin":"274.520","end":"302.400","lines":["Figuring out how to combat misleading and incorrect information about public health should be a top priority right now because we\u2019ve got plenty of contagions to keep an eye on. While the CDC is no longer requiring hospitals to report their COVID data, California\u2019s Department of Public Health says cases appear to be slowly rising in the state.

Those incredible light shows occurred when several solar flares and so-called coronal mass ejections hit us at the same time, creating a powerful solar storm.
