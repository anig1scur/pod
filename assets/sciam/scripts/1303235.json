      "text": "When you stop to think about it, it\u2019s not all that easy to speak. First you have to think of something to say. Then your brain has to tell your mouth to say it. Interruptions anywhere along this articulation pathway can impair the utterance, and create something like a stutter. Now, studying a neurocomputational model of this complex process, researchers have found that stuttering stems from a glitch in the neural circuit that initiates speech. They presented their findings at the Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America. [F. Guenther et al., Stuttering Starts at Speech Initiation, Not Due to Impaired Motor Skills]"

To understand the function of these circuits it\u2019s useful to consider something like the energizer bunny which has an on/off switch as well as a set of motors and gears that make the bunny walk and play drums when the switch is turned on."

Guenther says he\u2019d like to combine his model with imaging studies that show the basal ganglia in action\u2026to see whether his predicted mechanisms play a role in people who stutter. The ultimate goal is to come up with precisely targeted treatments\u2026like drugs that tweak the activity of the basal ganglia without inducing serious side effects\u2026"
