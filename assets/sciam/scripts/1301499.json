That ever growing constellation of devices embedded with computer brains and Internet connectivity is known as the \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d Lots of other stuff, though, like a carton of milk, doesn\u2019t have a microchip or smart sensor\u2014not to say that it couldn\u2019t."},{"author":"John Biggs","text":"For example, imagine smart labels on food products\u00a0that could alter their use-by date, depending on how they've been handled."},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"John Biggs is a distinguished engineer at the semiconductor company Arm. He and a team of researchers have now developed a proof-of-concept flexible chip that could be used for applications like outfitting a milk jug with computer smarts. And they say the chip is 12 times more complex than previous attempts. They describe it in a recent issue of the journal Nature. [John Biggs et al., A natively flexible 32-bit Arm microprocessor] They claim the microprocessor is cheap to build\u2014and it consists of thin-film transistors on a substrate of flexible, high-performance plastic\u00a0rather than rigid silicon."},{"author":"Biggs","text":"\u00a0This is just 40,000 transistors\u00a0implemented in about 60 square millimeters. Just to compare that to\u2014well, for example, the processor in the original iPhone back in 2007\u00a0is 14,000 times faster. So this is not a very high-performance microprocessor, but it\u2019s targeted at applications that really don\u2019t need that level of performance."},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"His co-author Catherine Ramsdale is senior vice president of technology at PragmatIC Semiconductor. She laid out the vision for how flexible chips like this might be used."},{"author":"Ramsdale","text":"We\u2019re talking, here, about putting electronics on the stuff you buy in Walmart or Tesco\u00a0every week, which just would help with supply chain management, waste management, provide information for real-time use-by dates,\u00a0health care monitoring. It provides a level of computing that\u2019s not available currently because it\u2019s not economic to do it."},{"author":"Biggs","text":"Yeah, extending the Internet of Things\u00a0to the \u201cInternet of everything.\u201d"},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"Despite that enthusiasm, the two admitted the project was a long way off from commercialization. For one, although the microprocessor is built on a substrate of flexible plastic, it was tested on a flat, not bendy, surface. Manos Tentzeris\u00a0is a professor in flexible electronics at Georgia Tech, who was not involved in the work."},{"author":"Tentzeris","text":"So whenever you refer to some flexible processor\u00a0or some flexible device or flexible module, one of the first results you must show is that bending this does not affect, significantly, the performance."},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"Biggs and Ramsdale said it can be a challenge to conduct tests while chips are bent or flexed\u2014and that they\u2019ll be looking into that in future work. Anshel Sag, who covers the semiconductor industry for Moor Insights & Strategy, pointed out another issue. He says the chips are currently too large, and their power consumption too high, to make them viable in terms of cost."},{"author":"Sag","text":"I think the use on a milk jug does make sense.\u00a0But I think you also have to account for cost. And unless these can be produced at an extremely low cost, there just won\u2019t be any viability for it."},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"Still, they all pointed out that silicon chips first reached this level of complexity a long time ago\u2014in the 70s and 80s\u2014and had to overcome many similar challenges to get where they are today. And John Biggs\u00a0from the semiconductor company? He\u2019s in it for the long game.\u00a0"},{"author":"Biggs","text":"What I see is flexible electronics is sort of trailing silicon by about three to four decades. So if we see anything like the rapid growth we\u2019ve seen in silicon over the last three to four decades, there could be some quite exciting developments in the area of flexible electronics over the next decade or two."},{"author":"Intagliata:'","text":"So that Internet of Everything may be coming.\u00a0It just may take a while to get here.
