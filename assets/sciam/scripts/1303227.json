I\u2019m Katie Hafner, the host of Lost Women of Science. Each season is devoted to the life and work of one scientist who hasn\u2019t gotten the recognition she deserves. We\u2019re calling this season \u201cA Grasshopper in Very Tall Grass,\u201d and it\u2019s all about Klara Dan von Neumann. Klari, as she was called by friends, was one of the world\u2019s first computer programmers. I\u2019ve been writing about computers for a really long time, more than 30 years in fact."},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"I even wrote a history of the internet in 1996, called Where Wizards Stay Up Late. And the wizards? All men. I\u2019ve been on this beat for so long, I thought I knew all the major figures. But then I stumbled upon Klara von Neumann\u2019s name this past year, and I drew a blank. How had I missed her? When I asked some big-hitters in the computer science world about her, they all had the same response: Who?"},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"I couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that here was this truly \u201clost\u201d woman of computing\u2013who was nonetheless connected to very well-known histories and people. She was involved in nuclear weapons research, she worked for Los Alamos, she coded for the ENIAC, one of the earliest electronic computers.\u00a0 And she ran in a circle of famous scientists\u2014people like Albert Einstein, J."},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"Robert Oppenheimer, and her own husband, John von Neumann, a famous Hungarian scientist who was considered one of the smartest people alive.\u00a0 I thought Klari could teach us a thing or two about this time\u2013the dawn of electronic computers and nuclear warfare. And so we started digging. This season is the result of what we found. Here\u2019s the trailer: [Trailer] UNKNOWN #1: Do I know who Klara von Neumann is?

Their contributions unacknowledged."},{"author":"GEORGE DYSON","text":"Klara's role was, sort sorta hidden because she had worked on the very secret bomb calculations."},{"author":"CLAIRE EVANS: ","text":"Women got to be programmers and got to make such a huge impact on programming because that job was seen as not being important."},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"In 1947, it was Klara and her code that made nuclear weapons simulations possible."},{"author":"ANANYO BHATTACHARYA","text":"Programming was this completely new discipline, so really everybody was starting on the ground floor as it were."},{"author":"MARINA WHITMAN","text":"She always said she liked it because she liked puzzles. And this was a kind of puzzle."},{"author":"THOMAS HAIGH","text":"I mean, she's like at Los Alamos as someone with absolutely no training in physics or mathematics talking one-on-one with Nobel prize winners, which is pretty incredible."},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"And she was working with a brand new technology, deep inside a world forever changed by nuclear weapons."},{"author":"CLAIRE EVANS","text":"There's this connection between death and computing that is inextricable and inescapable in this history."},{"author":"KATIE HAFNER","text":"Join us as we seek to understand the origins of modern computing, through one extraordinary woman's story."},{"author":"GEORGE DYSON","text":"She was sort of there at the moment of creation.
