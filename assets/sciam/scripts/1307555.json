In our last few Friday Fascination episodes, journalist Sofia Moutinho has taken us along for her ride on the Nathaniel B. Palmer, an icebreaker traveling through the Southern Ocean. Today marks the end of our journey with Sofia, so if this is the first time you\u2019re hearing about Antarctica in our feed, definitely go back and catch up. In today\u2019s episode, Sofia speaks with some of the scientists on the icebreaker as they make their way back home\u2014and as they grapple with how to feel about the beauty and horror they\u2019ve witnessed at sea. [CLIP: Sound of waves]"},{"author":"Sofia Moutinho","text":"After spending two months traveling through West Antarctica\u2019s Amundsen Sea onboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer, we are approaching the end of our expedition. Researchers collected sea ice and thousands of gallons of seawater at 27 different spots in the ocean surrounding Antarctica. Those samples allow them to examine different biogeochemical processes, some of them linked to climate change and the future of our planet. We endured bad weather in our quest to reach certain places. One of them was Pine Island Bay, a remote coastal area of West Antarctica that is usually blocked by sea ice, even in the summer. We mentioned Thwaites Glacier, nicknamed the \u201cDoomsday Glacier,\u201d in Episode One. Pine Island Glacier is melting at a similarly rapid rate, discharging lots of glacial ice into the bay."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Peter Sedwick, a chemical oceanographer at Old Dominion University and one of the cruise\u2019s leaders, told me sampling of the area in recent years has been very limited."},{"author":"Peter Sedwick","text":"It\u2019s not very often open to an oceanographic vessel getting in there. So we were very much hoping to get in there, but at this stage I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019ll make it."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The Palmer rammed through the ice-covered sea for hours trying to reach Pine Island. [CLIP: Sounds of waves and ice floes hitting the ship\u2019s hull]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The ship\u2019s captain told Peter why breaking through was so difficult."},{"author":"Sedwick","text":"He used the analogy of a little kid coming up and trying to hit you as hard as they could, and an adult having his hand on the little kid\u2019s forehead, and the kid\u2019s just swinging\u2014 swinging at him and not able to get at him. That was the analogy of the ship trying to break through the heavy sea-ice barrier."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"In the end the Palmer couldn\u2019t make it through the heavy ice, and the decision was made not to go further. The wind was blowing us toward the shore, and if we kept trying, we risked being trapped between the sea ice and the coast. It took us about two weeks to navigate out of Antarctica to our final port in Lyttelton, New Zealand. During this period the researchers started packing everything for a smooth \u201cdemobilization\u201d upon arrival. [CLIP: Sounds of equipment being moved around and metal chains being used to secure cargo]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"We wouldn\u2019t have long at port to unload everything, so the researchers had to start packing samples and equipment on our way to the dock. On the way back the seas were rough at times and made the ship rock a lot. At night in my room I could hear the noise of little crumbles of dirt and other debris rolling on the floor as the ship moved from side to side. [CLIP: Sound of dirt rolling around]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Sleeping in these conditions felt as if I was tied to a seesaw controlled by energetic children. This continued for about two days while we navigated through 18-foot swells that left some people, including me, seasick. Annie Stefanides, a research assistant at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, was a first-time cruiser onboard. I asked her what she found to be the most difficult part of the trip."},{"author":"Annie Stefanides","text":"Well, right now I\u2019m thinking about seasickness the most. That has been pretty challenging, but in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s only been a few days where we\u2019ve actually been transiting and it\u2019s been rough, compared to being on stations for, like, 40 days in a row."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"On our way back to port, those who did not feel sick could relax and dream about what they would do on land. But time passed extremely slowly, even if we tried to fill it with movies, game nights and arts and crafts. Margot Debyser, a postdoctoral researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, got bored during this period. But the prospect of leaving the ship was bittersweet for her nevertheless."},{"author":"Margot Debyser","text":"Time is passing slowly. But then you look back and you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, that was so fast.\u201d And then it\u2019s like the end comes before you kind of are actually ready for it. And I always get really sad on, like, the port call out, and everyone\u2019s saying goodbye, but I feel like you don\u2019t really have the time to say goodbye to everyone, so there\u2019s a lot of people you just don\u2019t say goodbye to. The time we\u2019ve spent all together right now, it\u2019s more than, like, your closest friends in real life because you never spend 24/7 with your really close friends, unless you live with them or something, you know? So I feel like you get to know people quite deeply. But at the same time it\u2019s, like, just once, and then you never see them again. So it\u2019s pretty\u2014it\u2019s pretty weird."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"As we got closer to land the prospect of regaining access to the Internet and reconnecting with the outside world became almost frightening for some researchers."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"When our phones are going to start buzzing again, and it\u2019s like all your notifications from the last three months are, like, catching back up to you, I find that very overwhelming because we kind of get used to a slower pace of life. [CLIP: Sounds of incoming text messages and mobile phone notifications] Getting back to, like, real life, it feels like you get back into a city, and everything\u2019s, like, really high-speed, and, like, everyone\u2019s going really fast, and there\u2019s a lot of things to do, and it takes me a while to, like, get back into that. [CLIP: \u201cWe Are Giants,\u201d by Silver Maple]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"During this strange hiatus it was like we were between two worlds: not quite in Antarctica anymore but not yet close to home either. It got me thinking about the one-of-a-kind place we had visited and how the experience had affected us. We had witnessed these pristine icy landscapes. We met countless animals and saw imposing glaciers that didn\u2019t look like they could disappear at all. Everything seemed so untouched. I knew about the urgent danger to Antarctica and climate scientists\u2019 warnings about the continent\u2019s fate. But it was hard to connect that reality to a place that seemed so immaculate. And I wasn\u2019t alone in that feeling."},{"author":"Stefanides","text":"I think it\u2019s also hard, too, when you\u2019re seeing something so beautiful for the first time because you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, this is so amazing. Like, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with this picture.\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Annie again."},{"author":"Stefanides","text":"But we know that environments are changing, so that\u2019s not true. And habitats for these animals are changing, and the water is changing. It wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind, I guess."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"For Carl Lamborg, a chemical oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, it was a matter of comparison with other icy landscapes he\u2019s seen."},{"author":"Carl Lamborg","text":"If all the dire predictions happen, there will still be ice in Antarctica to some extent, probably. Like, when you go to glaciers in Alaska, or I was just in Greenland recently as well, but definitely mountain glaciers\u2014you know, the ones that you can see retreating sort of year after year after year\u2014that really feels like a landscape that is disappearing. The thing that I\u2019m sort of impressed with\u2014and, gosh, we only saw a tiny bit here\u2014is how immense this landscape is. And it\u2019s hard to imagine that we could melt all of it."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"But even in this vast and beautiful landscape, the specter of climate change and the potential fate of this area loomed. Marissa Despins is a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Cruz."},{"author":"Marissa Despins","text":"When you\u2019re in Arctic, Antarctic landscapes, it\u2019s normal to think about climate change and, like, what\u2019s happening, and, like, the reason why we\u2019re here is to look at the influence of the melting ice sheet and what effect that\u2019s going to have on the Amundsen Sea. I don\u2019t think I always think about it because it is depressing and sad. But, yeah, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s, like, definitely always in the back of my mind."},{"author":"Nicole Coffey","text":"It\u2019s such a magnificent place that I would love to come back to. But at the same time, in the back of your head is that, like, \u201cBut will it be like this when I finally get the opportunity to come back?\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Nicole Coffey, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota."},{"author":"Coffey","text":"And it worries me that it\u2019s not going to be this pristine forever. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any coming back from it at this point, which is a depressing thought, and I hope there is."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Laura Whitmore, a chemical oceanographer at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, says that she finds herself separating the emotional aspects of climate change from her everyday work."},{"author":"Laura Whitmore","text":"I think that a very rational way to look at it is that things change. We\u2019re always in a constant state of change, and what I\u2019m trying to do is learn how and why things are changing. And that\u2019s a very, like, kind of impersonal way to isolate that from becoming an emotional kind of part of my day-to-day grind."},{"author":"Lamborg","text":"Well, maybe it\u2019s sort of sick, but, I mean, it\u2019s sort of exciting in the sense that any kind of an environment that\u2019s changing dramatically feels like an exciting opportunity to study things\u2014just from a purely scientific point of view. That\u2019s one sort of response. The other is, I guess, kind of a feeling like, \u201cOh, we need to document this before it\u2019s gone.\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Balancing the day-to-day routine of science with the urgent questions underpinning the research can be challenging."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"I think we all have our existential crisis every so often."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Margot again."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"Sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re making a difference because it\u2019s such a slow process to, like, you know, build this work together and publish it, and to go from collecting the data to analyzing it to publishing it takes so long that I think sometimes in the process you kind of lose sight of what you\u2019re doing and how it\u2019s useful."},{"author":"Rob Sherrell","text":"I mean, a lot of times we\u2019re just very busy with doing the work, and it\u2019s easy and interesting to get lost in the details. But I would say, more and more, I find myself just reflecting on what we\u2019re doing here to essentially understand this process better."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Rob Sherrell, an oceanographer at Rutgers University. He\u2019s also a cruise leader and has been on expeditions to the Antarctic several times. Despite his experience in the field, what he sees when he visits still stings."},{"author":"Sherrell","text":"It\u2019s very powerful and upsetting. And it\u2019s really scary, it\u2019s sad and scary."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"And Rob isn\u2019t just worried about West Antarctica."},{"author":"Sherrell","text":"There\u2019s some good evidence recently that there are places in East Antarctica which are also beginning to melt at unusually fast rates."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"As we were making our way back from our expedition, scientists published a paper focused on a part of East Antarctica once thought to be relatively stable in terms of ice melt. They concluded that this region could be more vulnerable than previously assumed. And that matters: the authors cite research suggesting that if all the ice in the region\u2019s Wilkes Subglacial Basin were to melt, the global sea level could rise upwards of 10 feet. Faced with this kind of emergency, Rob sometimes ponders his role as a scientist."},{"author":"Sherrell","text":"You know, I wonder sometimes if I\u2019m employing my energies in the right direction. It\u2019s one thing to study the effects of climate change, and it\u2019s important but probably more important to do whatever we can to leave the fossil fuels in the ground."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Phoebe Lam, a chemical oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and another lead scientist on the expedition, has similar thoughts."},{"author":"Phoebe Lam","text":"More science is going to allow us to understand the natural system better so that later on we can do something about it. But it\u2019s not the most direct solution. If you want to save the world, become a politician, an economist, a lawyer\u2014not a scientist probably, I think, right now. But I also feel like we all have something to contribute. There\u2019s, like, tiny little cogs, right? And there\u2019s, you know, whatever, eight billion people in the world; not everyone could be a lawyer or a policy person fighting for climate-policy change. We all need to be contributing what we\u2019re good at because the world needs all of our talents in order to, like, stitch these solutions together."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"For Phoebe optimism comes from the power of education. As a university professor she aims to inform the next generation of decision makers."},{"author":"Lam","text":"The science education is hugely important. We need to explain to people why this is important: what\u2019s happening, that it\u2019s real, that it\u2019s accelerating, there\u2019s no doubt. Like, all of that is, I think, our primary job, and that\u2019s why I feel like being a professor is important: because I can communicate that to undergrads. I\u2019m going to continue doing science, which is useful but, you know, not going to deal with reducing fossil-fuel emissions, you know, realistically. And then I\u2019m going to take my knowledge and my approach to try to sort of help steer the next generation to actually fix it."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Nicole also feels that communication is critical."},{"author":"Coffey","text":"I hope that people seeing things like this, both in, like, photo form or, like, through your writing and your podcasts, and if they have the chance to see something similar like it, I hope it makes them care. [CLIP: Sound of waves]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"I feel very lucky that I could join the researchers onboard the Palmer and visit a place as amazing as Antarctica. I hope that the landscapes I witnessed remain intact out there\u2014not just in my memory. [CLIP: Theme music] I understand that it can be difficult to care about Antarctica if you haven\u2019t seen it. Why should anyone care about this remote, icy land where no humans live permanently? But as we have seen in this series, the future of Antarctica is tied to the future of our oceans and our planet. The continent\u2019s melting ice will continue contributing to sea-level rise, which impacts coastal communities all around the world. And that melting could also change marine biogeochemical processes in a way that has a direct impact on our planet\u2019s climate. The researchers I met on the Palmer are doing their part, gathering unique data that might help us understand where things are going. But another question remains: What will we do about it?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thanks for joining us on this Friday Fascination adventure.

Like, all of that is, I think, our primary job, and that\u2019s why I feel like being a professor is important: because I can communicate that to undergrads. I\u2019m going to continue doing science, which is useful but, you know, not going to deal with reducing fossil-fuel emissions, you know, realistically. And then I\u2019m going to take my knowledge and my approach to try to sort of help steer the next generation to actually fix it."]},{"begin":"861.200","end":"864.600","lines":["Nicole also feels that communication is critical."]},{"begin":"864.600","end":"877.320","lines":["I hope that people seeing things like this, both in, like, photo form or, like, through your writing and your podcasts, and if they have the chance to see something similar like it, I hope it makes them care.

I hope that the landscapes I witnessed remain intact out there\u2014not just in my memory. [CLIP: Theme music] I understand that it can be difficult to care about Antarctica if you haven\u2019t seen it. Why should anyone care about this remote, icy land where no humans live permanently? But as we have seen in this series, the future of Antarctica is tied to the future of our oceans and our planet. The continent\u2019s melting ice will continue contributing to sea-level rise, which impacts coastal communities all around the world. And that melting could also change marine biogeochemical processes in a way that has a direct impact on our planet\u2019s climate. The researchers I met on the Palmer are doing their part, gathering unique data that might help us understand where things are going. But another question remains: What will we do about it?"]},{"begin":"951.680","end":"1015.080","lines":["Thanks for joining us on this Friday Fascination adventure. Next week we\u2019ll be diving into some less pristine waters to learn about Parisian efforts to clean up the Seine in time for the Olympics. And you can look forward to future Fascination series about niche archeological research, video games and more. But we\u2019ve got plenty of little science snacks to tide you over until then.
