She says that back then, the land we\u2019re looking down on was completely blanketed in green: the crowns of millions of trees, intertwined. The few subsistence farms that interrupted this green ocean only seemed to prove how vast the jungle was. Today all we see through the plane\u2019s window glass are brown and green jigsaw puzzle pieces alternating between newly cleared jungle, grain crops and the remains of recent harvests."

I\u2019ve come to the Amazon to find out what Luciana is learning about the health of the forest and its role in influencing the rate of climate change. And the plane we\u2019re on isn\u2019t just used for taking in the view. It\u2019s part of Luciana\u2019s science. She hires this plane and others like it to collect air above the changing forest\u2014because mixed in with that air is a key to climate change: carbon dioxide. Here\u2019s a little background: 30 percent of the carbon dioxide released globally by burning fossil fuel gets absorbed in soil and vegetation, probably mostly in forests. That forest uptake slows the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and slows global warming. And when crops replace that forest, carbon uptake declines."

What she gets out of her atmospheric samples is an exquisite vertical profile of changing CO2 over the forest..., and it really does change with height and time. That\u2019s because plants trap carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, and soil microbes emit it by the process of respiration. The difference between this absorption and emission is the forest\u2019s net intake or release of carbon dioxide. Air closest to the ground is the most influenced by what\u2019s going on in the forest. And Luciana teases out what the forest is doing by comparing results from the highest to the lowest altitude."

Thirty-seven percent of original forest has been removed. Recent studies show that deforestation weakens nearby jungle that is otherwise untouched. Clear-cuts make neighboring intact forest hotter and drier, undermining its health. Forests are also more likely to burn when fire escapes from clear-cuts that have been turned into farms. Carlos says that unless climate change and deforestation are halted, a lot of the southern Amazon will soon be inhospitable to the trees that currently live there. Even trees that now grow\u00a0 in the much less lush savanna elsewhere in Brazil will find today\u2019s Amazon region too hot and dry."

Trees actually return much of this moisture to the atmosphere, which then blows farther west and falls again. This water recycling process happens over and over, moving critical wetness west.
