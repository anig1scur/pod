New research suggests that the words we choose when we apologize can signal how much effort we\u2019re putting into making amends, and that perceived effort has a big impact."},{"author":"","text":"Here to explain what makes an apology sound authentic is Shiri Lev-Ari, an associate professor in psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Shiri Lev-Ari","text":"Thank you for inviting me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you recently authored a paper about something that I think many of our listeners think a lot about, especially in the age of the Internet [laughs]: the idea of apologies and what makes one sound genuine. Could you tell me a little bit about your research background and kind of how you came to this question?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Yeah, so I\u2019m a researcher of language, but I\u2019m particularly interested in language when it has a social aspect, so to see how it helps in social functions and [is] influenced by social information. And I came to apologies because I find apologies quite interesting and bizarre. They\u2019re something that is called cheap talk because anyone can apologize, whether or not they mean it\u2014it costs them nothing\u2014so you think they\u2019d be meaningless, but they\u2019re really meaningful. So I was kind of interested in trying to think [about] what people do to the language to really help convince the other person that they really mean their apology."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and in the paper you talk about this concept of iconicity. Could you explain what that is for our listeners?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Yeah, so iconicity is when\u2014or at least specifically in spoken language\u2014is when the sounds or the form of a word resemble the meaning. So a few very easy to understand examples: for example, the sound /i/ is really associated with small size. So think about \u201citsy-bitty\u201d or \u201ctiny,\u201d so those sounds really sound small, and we actually know that across the world\u2019s languages, the word for \u201csmall\u201d is much more likely to have the sound /i/ than you\u2019d expect by chance."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, and so how does that relate to the idea of sort of evaluating apologies?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"So usually when people talk about iconicity they really think about inherent iconicity, so when the form of the word always conveys that meaning. So for example, \u201citsy-bitsy\u201d will always, like, sound small, and it doesn\u2019t matter in which context you\u2019re gonna say \u201citsy-bitsy\u201d; it\u2019s gonna sound small."},{"author":"","text":"And what I was interested in is\u2014well, with the context of apologies\u2014I was more interested in how people try to convey effort in the context. So they would use words that in the context express the fact that they\u2019re really putting an effort into their apologies, even though in other contexts those words might not really reflect, necessarily, effort."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And why is effort so important when it comes to speaking and hearing an apology?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Well, so the thing is that we know that in real apologies what people usually do in order to convince the other person that they really mean their apology is really put an effort into the apology. So I\u2019ll give you an example that is both from an actual study but is also really, really intuitive to understand."},{"author":"","text":"So imagine that you read about a case where there are two students and one of them inadvertently did something that harmed the other one, didn\u2019t realize it at the time, and later on, when they found out, there are two options. Either the second they found out they traveled to where the other person is taking a class, even though they\u2019re not taking that class and they don\u2019t need to be there, so really inconvenienced themself and put in time and effort just to go and apologize as soon as possible. In the other case they apologize to the other student the next time they happen to see them. And when you ask someone, \u201cOkay, which of the two cases is the student more apologetic, or more mean the apology?\u201d it\u2019s kind of obvious that [it\u2019s] when they put in effort and inconvenience themself."},{"author":"","text":"So there really is a lot of evidence that seems really intuitive that putting in effort really reflects the fact that you\u2019re sorry. And what I was trying to do is [determine] whether I can also find it in the language itself\u2014so do people really try to convince the other person that they\u2019re sorry by using words that are harder to say to show: \u201cSee how much effort I\u2019m putting into my apology?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and so what are the different ways that we can speak in ways that take more effort? Is it just about the length of a word, or is there other stuff that can go on?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"One thing that is interesting is that there are two factors that really influence how difficult it is to say a word. One of them is how long the word is, so that\u2019s obvious: obviously, you\u2019re gonna spend more time and do more motor action in order to say or type the word. Another factor that really matters is how common the word is. So some words are much more common than others, and it\u2019s actually much easier to say common words. So it was easier to recall them, and even after you recall them it\u2019s actually easier to say, like, more frequent words."},{"author":"","text":"So there are two options of what apologizers can do. One thing is, you might think, \u201cOkay, maybe they\u2019re gonna use really long words and also really infrequent words to show, \u2018Look how much effort I\u2019m putting into it.\u2019\u201d But the problem is that this only thinks about the apologizer and doesn\u2019t really think about the other person."},{"author":"","text":"Now, if you also think about the effort for the other person, then long words are perfect. They\u2019re really, really hard to say but actually really, really easy to understand\u2014maybe even more than shorter words because they tend to be more different from other words and you have more time to process them. So it\u2019s great: you\u2019re putting in effort, and actually the listener doesn\u2019t need to put in any effort."},{"author":"","text":"But infrequent words are actually hard both for the person saying them but also for the listener, so you might think that if you\u2019re a sophisticated apologizer, you wouldn\u2019t want to use them because you wanna burden yourself but not the addressee. So maybe a sophisticated apologizer would use long words but will avoid low-frequency words."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, yeah, that makes sense."},{"author":"","text":"So can you talk a little bit about how you approached studying this question?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Yeah, so I did two studies, and in the first one I wanted to see what people actually do in the real world. So what I did is I went to social media, specifically Twitter, and I looked at apology tweets compared to other tweets by the same people, and I looked both at celebrities and noncelebrities just to see that it doesn\u2019t really matter who is apologizing. And in both cases I found that people use longer words when they apologize, but they don\u2019t use infrequent words. So they\u2019re really putting in the burden on themselves but not on the other person."},{"author":"","text":"And what I\u2019ve done next is I try to see, \u201cOkay, is this strategy effective at all?\u201d So I then did an experiment where I showed people different versions of apologies that, basically, had the same meaning\u2014they just differed in how long and how frequent the words were. So think, for example, about, \u201cMy action doesn\u2019t reflect my true self,\u201d versus \u201cMy action does not represent my true character.\u201d They mean the same thing, but, you know, \u201ccharacter\u201d versus \u201cself,\u201d \u201crepresent\u201d versus \u201creflect\u201d\u2014so longer words. And basically people needed to rank the different apologies with the same meaning from most to least apologetic. And we found that when apologies had longer words people ranked them as more apologetic, but they didn\u2019t care about frequency."},{"author":"","text":"So this really fits with what we found on Twitter. It seems that everyone basically seems [to think], \u201cOkay, like, long words really reflect apologeticness, and it\u2019s really the effort that a speaker is putting in.\u201d But people don\u2019t really pay attention to word frequency because that\u2019s hard for everyone, so it\u2019s not really what an apologizer should do."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What other questions are you hoping to answer about this topic? Do you have any further research planned?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"So what I\u2019m trying to look at, actually, right now that is related to this is trying to look at expression of gratitude and requests for help and try to see similarly, \u201cHow do people manipulate their speech to really help their message be more effective?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"So even after we ignore which word\u2014like, the meaning that they\u2019re trying to use, how, just by doing things like maybe, for example, using a higher versus a lower pitch to show, like, you know, greater warmth and submissiveness and things like that, how do they similarly show how they feel or their stance versus the other person?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019m curious, since doing this research has it changed the way you interpret or experience, like, celebrity apologies that come up in the news?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Ooh, celebrity apologies. I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m trying to think if there were famous celebrity apologies recently. But people have asked me whether I do it in my own speech now, and I have to say, that\u2019s\u2014I think it\u2019s unavoidable that I would pay attention to it, but it actually worries me because it seems that we all do it naturally and I\u2019m worried that if I actually overthink it, I might actually do it wrong and not as well as I do it naturally."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.] Well, I was going to ask you what advice you have for people who want to make their sincere apologies come across as effectively as possible, but it sounds like maybe the best thing we can do is to just mean our apologies and care about making amends. Would you say that that\u2019s correct [laughs]?"},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Yes, and I think that if we actually really try, it will come naturally, that these are the type of words that we use that are most effective."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk through this research. It\u2019s been super interesting."},{"author":"Lev-Ari","text":"Thank you for inviting me. Happy to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

Could you tell me a little bit about your research background and kind of how you came to this question?"]},{"begin":"98.040","end":"131.360","lines":["Yeah, so I\u2019m a researcher of language, but I\u2019m particularly interested in language when it has a social aspect, so to see how it helps in social functions and [is] influenced by social information. And I came to apologies because I find apologies quite interesting and bizarre. They\u2019re something that is called cheap talk because anyone can apologize, whether or not they mean it\u2014it costs them nothing\u2014so you think they\u2019d be meaningless, but they\u2019re really meaningful. So I was kind of interested in trying to think [about] what people do to the language to really help convince the other person that they really mean their apology."]},{"begin":"131.360","end":"139.600","lines":["Yeah, well, and in the paper you talk about this concept of iconicity. Could you explain what that is for our listeners?"]},{"begin":"139.600","end":"168.480","lines":["Yeah, so iconicity is when\u2014or at least specifically in spoken language\u2014is when the sounds or the form of a word resemble the meaning. So a few very easy to understand examples: for example, the sound /i/ is really associated with small size. So think about \u201citsy-bitty\u201d or \u201ctiny,\u201d so those sounds really sound small, and we actually know that across the world\u2019s languages, the word for \u201csmall\u201d is much more likely to have the sound /i/ than you\u2019d expect by chance."]},{"begin":"168.480","end":"173.480","lines":["Mm, and so how does that relate to the idea of sort of evaluating apologies?"]},{"begin":"173.480","end":"190.800","lines":["So usually when people talk about iconicity they really think about inherent iconicity, so when the form of the word always conveys that meaning. So for example, \u201citsy-bitsy\u201d will always, like, sound small, and it doesn\u2019t matter in which context you\u2019re gonna say \u201citsy-bitsy\u201d; it\u2019s gonna sound small."]},{"begin":"190.800","end":"213.560","lines":["And what I was interested in is\u2014well, with the context of apologies\u2014I was more interested in how people try to convey effort in the context. So they would use words that in the context express the fact that they\u2019re really putting an effort into their apologies, even though in other contexts those words might not really reflect, necessarily, effort."]},{"begin":"213.560","end":"218.680","lines":["And why is effort so important when it comes to speaking and hearing an apology?"]},{"begin":"218.680","end":"235.000","lines":["Well, so the thing is that we know that in real apologies what people usually do in order to convince the other person that they really mean their apology is really put an effort into the apology. So I\u2019ll give you an example that is both from an actual study but is also really, really intuitive to understand."]},{"begin":"235.000","end":"271.040","lines":["So imagine that you read about a case where there are two students and one of them inadvertently did something that harmed the other one, didn\u2019t realize it at the time, and later on, when they found out, there are two options. Either the second they found out they traveled to where the other person is taking a class, even though they\u2019re not taking that class and they don\u2019t need to be there, so really inconvenienced themself and put in time and effort just to go and apologize as soon as possible. In the other case they apologize to the other student the next time they happen to see them. And when you ask someone, \u201cOkay, which of the two cases is the student more apologetic, or more mean the apology?\u201d it\u2019s kind of obvious that [it\u2019s] when they put in effort and inconvenience themself."]},{"begin":"271.040","end":"291.120","lines":["So there really is a lot of evidence that seems really intuitive that putting in effort really reflects the fact that you\u2019re sorry. And what I was trying to do is [determine] whether I can also find it in the language itself\u2014so do people really try to convince the other person that they\u2019re sorry by using words that are harder to say to show: \u201cSee how much effort I\u2019m putting into my apology?\u201d"]},{"begin":"291.120","end":"300.200","lines":["Yeah, and so what are the different ways that we can speak in ways that take more effort? Is it just about the length of a word, or is there other stuff that can go on?"]},{"begin":"300.200","end":"327.840","lines":["One thing that is interesting is that there are two factors that really influence how difficult it is to say a word. One of them is how long the word is, so that\u2019s obvious: obviously, you\u2019re gonna spend more time and do more motor action in order to say or type the word. Another factor that really matters is how common the word is. So some words are much more common than others, and it\u2019s actually much easier to say common words. So it was easier to recall them, and even after you recall them it\u2019s actually easier to say, like, more frequent words."]},{"begin":"327.840","end":"343.560","lines":["So there are two options of what apologizers can do. One thing is, you might think, \u201cOkay, maybe they\u2019re gonna use really long words and also really infrequent words to show, \u2018Look how much effort I\u2019m putting into it.\u2019\u201d But the problem is that this only thinks about the apologizer and doesn\u2019t really think about the other person."]},{"begin":"343.560","end":"363.280","lines":["Now, if you also think about the effort for the other person, then long words are perfect. They\u2019re really, really hard to say but actually really, really easy to understand\u2014maybe even more than shorter words because they tend to be more different from other words and you have more time to process them. So it\u2019s great: you\u2019re putting in effort, and actually the listener doesn\u2019t need to put in any effort."]},{"begin":"363.280","end":"382.440","lines":["But infrequent words are actually hard both for the person saying them but also for the listener, so you might think that if you\u2019re a sophisticated apologizer, you wouldn\u2019t want to use them because you wanna burden yourself but not the addressee. So maybe a sophisticated apologizer would use long words but will avoid low-frequency words."]},{"begin":"382.440","end":"384.240","lines":["Mm, yeah, that makes sense."]},{"begin":"384.240","end":"388.920","lines":["So can you talk a little bit about how you approached studying this question?"]},{"begin":"388.920","end":"417.720","lines":["Yeah, so I did two studies, and in the first one I wanted to see what people actually do in the real world. So what I did is I went to social media, specifically Twitter, and I looked at apology tweets compared to other tweets by the same people, and I looked both at celebrities and noncelebrities just to see that it doesn\u2019t really matter who is apologizing. And in both cases I found that people use longer words when they apologize, but they don\u2019t use infrequent words. So they\u2019re really putting in the burden on themselves but not on the other person."]},{"begin":"417.720","end":"458.480","lines":["And what I\u2019ve done next is I try to see, \u201cOkay, is this strategy effective at all?\u201d So I then did an experiment where I showed people different versions of apologies that, basically, had the same meaning\u2014they just differed in how long and how frequent the words were. So think, for example, about, \u201cMy action doesn\u2019t reflect my true self,\u201d versus \u201cMy action does not represent my true character.\u201d They mean the same thing, but, you know, \u201ccharacter\u201d versus \u201cself,\u201d \u201crepresent\u201d versus \u201creflect\u201d\u2014so longer words. And basically people needed to rank the different apologies with the same meaning from most to least apologetic. And we found that when apologies had longer words people ranked them as more apologetic, but they didn\u2019t care about frequency."]},{"begin":"458.480","end":"476.800","lines":["So this really fits with what we found on Twitter. It seems that everyone basically seems [to think], \u201cOkay, like, long words really reflect apologeticness, and it\u2019s really the effort that a speaker is putting in.\u201d But people don\u2019t really pay attention to word frequency because that\u2019s hard for everyone, so it\u2019s not really what an apologizer should do."]},{"begin":"476.800","end":"483.400","lines":["What other questions are you hoping to answer about this topic? Do you have any further research planned?"]},{"begin":"483.400","end":"499.080","lines":["So what I\u2019m trying to look at, actually, right now that is related to this is trying to look at expression of gratitude and requests for help and try to see similarly, \u201cHow do people manipulate their speech to really help their message be more effective?\u201d"]},{"begin":"499.080","end":"517.520","lines":["So even after we ignore which word\u2014like, the meaning that they\u2019re trying to use, how, just by doing things like maybe, for example, using a higher versus a lower pitch to show, like, you know, greater warmth and submissiveness and things like that, how do they similarly show how they feel or their stance versus the other person?"]},{"begin":"517.520","end":"526.680","lines":["I\u2019m curious, since doing this research has it changed the way you interpret or experience, like, celebrity apologies that come up in the news?"]},{"begin":"526.680","end":"549.360","lines":["Ooh, celebrity apologies. I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m trying to think if there were famous celebrity apologies recently. But people have asked me whether I do it in my own speech now, and I have to say, that\u2019s\u2014I think it\u2019s unavoidable that I would pay attention to it, but it actually worries me because it seems that we all do it naturally and I\u2019m worried that if I actually overthink it, I might actually do it wrong and not as well as I do it naturally."]},{"begin":"549.360","end":"564.840","lines":["[Laughs.] Well, I was going to ask you what advice you have for people who want to make their sincere apologies come across as effectively as possible, but it sounds like maybe the best thing we can do is to just mean our apologies and care about making amends.
