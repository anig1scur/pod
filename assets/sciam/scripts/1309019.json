What if we could get a hand from an all-natural disinfectant that was more than 100 times more effective than bleach but so gentle and safe that you could spray it into your eyes?"},{"author":"","text":"It might sound like the sort of quackery you\u2019d get sold in a shady Facebook group, but such a compound really does exist. It\u2019s called hypochlorous acid. And in addition to all of those awesome qualities I just listed, it\u2019s also cheap\u2014plus you can make it at home. So why don\u2019t we use it for, like, everything?"},{"author":"","text":"Here to explain is Jen Schwartz, a senior features editor for Scientific American."},{"author":"","text":"Jen, thanks so much for coming in to chat today."},{"author":"Jen Schwartz","text":"Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you wrote a piece about hypochlorous acid, which I feel like I\u2019ve been seeing everywhere lately. So let\u2019s start with the obvious: What is this compound?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"So it\u2019s so fascinating to me that you say you\u2019ve been seeing it everywhere because when I had this idea, which really came a few years ago, I thought that no one [laughs] knew about this. But I became aware of it in answering what this thing is: It\u2019s a disinfectant, and it is something that is made in our bodies. It is part of how our white blood cells fight infection; they go to, like, a wound that you have and they release biocides, including hypochlorous acid. That just goes and, like, dismantles bad things that you don\u2019t want, pathogens, and rips the, you know, cell walls apart and dismantles the DNA."},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s an extremely effective disinfectant that\u2019s made in the body, and then, of course, there is a synthetic version that we can make pretty easily, and that is what we\u2019re seeing in all of these products that are used as sanitizers and disinfectants, and now it\u2019s really become more pervasive in, like, the skin-care and beauty industry for use on your skin."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what first got you interested in looking into this?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"I learned about hypochlorous acid during the early days of COVID, when my dad, who at that point was still working as an ENT doctor\u2014you know, I was like, \u201cMy God, Dad, you\u2019re, like, hovering six inches, like, over people\u2019s noses and throats during, like, acute COVID.\u201d And we were talking, like, what is something more that, you know, people like him in, in health care could use as a tool to protect themselves\u2014in addition, of course, to, like, wearing masks and washing your hands?"},{"author":"","text":"And so that\u2019s how I learned about this in the first place. And so I was really curious about, you know, how is this being studied as a potential nasal irrigation or nasal spray? Is it safe enough to put on the mucosa? And let\u2019s say, like, you are exposed in your day job, right\u2014if you work in health care and there\u2019s an emerging [laughs], like, pandemic\u2014is this something that you could spray up your nose once or twice a day? And if you do have viral particles hanging out there, would it kill them on the spot and prevent them from, like, entering your lungs and becoming a full-blown infection?"},{"author":"","text":"And so that was, like, the initial sort of question and speculation: \u201cAre we going to potentially see this become useful in this way, as, like, a preventative?\u201d And again, it would just be one more tool that people would have to, like, reduce severity of infection. And it looks like, you know, that has definitely been researched over the past several years. There\u2019s not, like, consensus on it. I think that\u2019s, like, a really promising potential pathway that people are looking into, and that\u2019s something pretty different from how most people are encountering hypochlorous acid right now, which as\u2014is, like, a toner [laughs] in the beauty aisle. So I think it\u2019s cool to realize that this thing that you\u2019re spraying on your face and using to, like, cut down bacteria on your face could also have really cool medical implications."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and what specifically about this disinfectant makes it really exciting for all of these different applications?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"I think what\u2019s so exciting about it is that it is so effective, right? You know, it\u2019s at least 100 times more effective at killing really hard-to-kill pathogens and microbes and bacteria and fungi\u2014it\u2019s 100 times more effective than the active ingredient in bleach."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"And so it\u2019s extremely good at what it does, and yet it\u2019s incredibly safe. It is nontoxic to people and animals. It is not bad for the environment. I mean, you can spray this stuff into your eyes; it\u2019s, it\u2019s used as a cleaner for, like, your eyelids in medical context. So what\u2019s so cool about it is that it works so well and yet, even unlike something like alcohol, which we put on our hands all the time to sanitize them\u2014alcohol dries out your skin, it can be very irritating and lead to dermatitis and other things, and hypochlorous acid is, like, really benign in that way. And I think that\u2019s what I got so excited about."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. So if this is so great and so, you know, gentle, why isn\u2019t it what we use to clean everything?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"You know, and that\u2019s what I really set out to try to figure out. The most straightforward answer is that it has very little stability ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"It is not shelf-stable. So the way that it\u2019s made, you\u2019re going through a process of taking essentially salt and water and then turning it into hypochlorous acid through the process of electrolysis. And so it\u2019s, essentially, when you get to that place, it is very sensitive to light, to air, to changes in pH, and that can, you know, sort of go back into becoming just saltwater again, so it becomes completely useless in that case. Or in certain other ways it might, you know, develop more\u2014a higher percentage of it, a higher concentration, would become, like, something like chlorine gas, which, of course, is dangerous."},{"author":"","text":"So the reason it\u2019s not sort of everywhere is that it\u2019s really hard to, like, manufacture and bottle this thing and keep it exactly what it is and have the conditions be exactly right. And there\u2019s been some changes over the past several years where more companies are sort of figuring out that puzzle and making it more available to consumers, as opposed to just something that is used in, like, commercial and industrial cleaning contexts, where there\u2019s more control over how that product is managed."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and one of the things you mentioned in your piece is that, especially during the peak pandemic era, there were some countries and, you know, settings and institutions where this was almost being used to sort of fumigate people on their way in and out of shared spaces. What do we know about how effective it actually is in that context?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"So I think, in that context, it was pretty much seen, like, maybe it\u2019s not that effective to disinfect a person [laughs] in that way. And I think, you know, what, what\u2019s really interesting is this is a great product, or it\u2019s a great molecule, to be used on surfaces and things like that. But, you know, spraying it in the air in that way, is that really that effective? Not really, especially when we\u2019re dealing with infectious, like, respiratory illnesses, where you\u2019re looking at things that are airborne or through droplets. And I think, in those cases, the sort of, you know, fogging it everywhere has been proved, like, not that effective. And what you\u2019re really trying to do when you fog a room is get, like, even distribution ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"On all types of surfaces in the room, so I don\u2019t think there was much, like\u2014I think during the pandemic we were sort of throwing spaghetti at the wall ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"And trying all sorts of things, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll see that going forward."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, makes sense."},{"author":"","text":"So you mentioned that different companies are finding solutions for the instability of this compound, but you also mentioned in your piece that there are a lot of brands marketing hypochlorous acid\u2014like I said, I feel like I\u2019ve seen it everywhere\u2014that maybe aren\u2019t actually solving the stability problem and are maybe ultimately selling people saltwater. Could you talk a little bit more about what consumers should be on the lookout for?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"I think what\u2019s so fascinating is that this has been used as, you know, something in, like, wound care and medical contexts for a long time, and now you\u2019re seeing that product enter a market that is regulated in a completely different way and in a, you know, far less rigorous way. We all know that there\u2019s, like, not that much oversight [laughs] when it comes to what people can call things in the beauty industry and how they\u2019re marketed."},{"author":"","text":"So I think what\u2019s fascinating is there are, like, legitimate cases where we wanna be looking at: \u201cWhat is this thing really good for?\u201d And I think there are a lot of really promising potential uses for it. I just think right now, when something goes the route of, like, you know, getting made into a product that anyone can really make and bottle and sell, the thing that I get a little\u2014that would make me skeptical are some of the products that have other additives. So if you\u2019re putting hypochlorous acid in a bottle and then you\u2019re adding, like, essential oils or all sorts of other things, that\u2019s gonna really affect the formulation ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"And its stability. So I think, like, if you want to use this as a toner or facial spray, you know, for treating acne or eczema or something to put in your gym bag to spray your face, like, after the gym, just look for something that is, like, a pure formulation. You don\u2019t need all these other additives, and they can actually potentially harm the product."},{"author":"","text":"So I think that\u2019s, like, the main thing that I would look out for. And you don\u2019t need unnecessary things. Like, it doesn\u2019t need to be made out of pink Himalayan sea salt [laughs]. Like, that\u2019s just something that\u2019s, you know, a distraction from the actual use of the product."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And there are also products that allow people to make this on their own, right?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"Right. You know, I didn\u2019t try any of those products for myself, but I think it\u2019s really interesting. There\u2019s versions of this, right? You take something that\u2019s done in an industrial context, and you shrink it down to, like, a countertop-sized device, and, you know, there\u2019s no reason, really, why this shouldn\u2019t work. And I think if you\u2019re someone who takes, like, the cleaning of your house really seriously or you\u2019ve just had something like norovirus sweep through your house, could this be a really interesting application? I think so, and I think what\u2019s great about it is that, you know, you can\u2019t put Clorox bleach everywhere, on all surfaces. With hypochlorous acid there\u2019s just a lot more applications, not just in surfaces, where it\u2019s not gonna harm it and where it\u2019s going to be effective, but also, of course, like, on your skin. So if you have pets and kids, it\u2019s not the same concern as spraying bleach everywhere."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Have you been using hypochlorous acid yourself?"},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"I have been. I have it with me today [laughs]. One of the things that I love using it for is, I spray it on my phone case ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"So I do that a lot. I also, like, when I get back from the grocery store, I spray it on, like, my bananas and just leave them on the counter or if I get avocados. I do often spray my face and my hands."},{"author":"","text":"The number one thing that this story sort of informed me about when I was reporting is, like, as with all disinfectants, you have to let them sit for a little bit. And hypochlorous acid on hard, nonporous surfaces still requires, like, 30 to 60 seconds to be, like, really, really effective at killing everything. But if you think about the way that we clean surfaces in our lives or even spray our hands, are you letting something sit on your hands for 60 seconds? Are they saturated? I used to clean my phone with, you know, whatever I could find. But I would spray it on and then sort of immediately wipe it off. And so what I\u2019ve learned is that however effective your disinfectant is, you also have to be using it in the right way."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"So I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at, like [laughs], spraying my hands, really soaking them, and then letting them sit for a minute, and then I\u2019ll, like, wipe off the rest, and I feel like that wiping action is also really good at physically removing things [laughs] that might be there."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. Thanks so much for coming in to chat about this. It\u2019s rare that I see something, like, lauded as, like, a miracle molecule, and then I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, it turns out it is actually probably good for stuff.\u201d I will probably get this to spray on my face, so thank you [laughs]."},{"author":"Schwartz","text":"[Laughs] Thank you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

And if you do have viral particles hanging out there, would it kill them on the spot and prevent them from, like, entering your lungs and becoming a full-blown infection?"]},{"begin":"275.280","end":"327.360","lines":["And so that was, like, the initial sort of question and speculation: \u201cAre we going to potentially see this become useful in this way, as, like, a preventative?\u201d And again, it would just be one more tool that people would have to, like, reduce severity of infection. And it looks like, you know, that has definitely been researched over the past several years. There\u2019s not, like, consensus on it. I think that\u2019s, like, a really promising potential pathway that people are looking into, and that\u2019s something pretty different from how most people are encountering hypochlorous acid right now, which as\u2014is, like, a toner [laughs] in the beauty aisle. So I think it\u2019s cool to realize that this thing that you\u2019re spraying on your face and using to, like, cut down bacteria on your face could also have really cool medical implications."]},{"begin":"327.360","end":"337.360","lines":["Yeah, and what specifically about this disinfectant makes it really exciting for all of these different applications?"]},{"begin":"337.360","end":"356.760","lines":["I think what\u2019s so exciting about it is that it is so effective, right? You know, it\u2019s at least 100 times more effective at killing really hard-to-kill pathogens and microbes and bacteria and fungi\u2014it\u2019s 100 times more effective than the active ingredient in bleach."]},{"begin":"356.760","end":"357.600","lines":["Wow."]},{"begin":"357.600","end":"401.800","lines":["And so it\u2019s extremely good at what it does, and yet it\u2019s incredibly safe. It is nontoxic to people and animals. It is not bad for the environment. I mean, you can spray this stuff into your eyes; it\u2019s, it\u2019s used as a cleaner for, like, your eyelids in medical context. So what\u2019s so cool about it is that it works so well and yet, even unlike something like alcohol, which we put on our hands all the time to sanitize them\u2014alcohol dries out your skin, it can be very irritating and lead to dermatitis and other things, and hypochlorous acid is, like, really benign in that way. And I think that\u2019s what I got so excited about."]},{"begin":"401.800","end":"408.280","lines":["Yeah. So if this is so great and so, you know, gentle, why isn\u2019t it what we use to clean everything?"]},{"begin":"408.280","end":"417.600","lines":["You know, and that\u2019s what I really set out to try to figure out. The most straightforward answer is that it has very little stability ..."]},{"begin":"417.600","end":"418.280","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"418.280","end":"455.400","lines":["It is not shelf-stable. So the way that it\u2019s made, you\u2019re going through a process of taking essentially salt and water and then turning it into hypochlorous acid through the process of electrolysis. And so it\u2019s, essentially, when you get to that place, it is very sensitive to light, to air, to changes in pH, and that can, you know, sort of go back into becoming just saltwater again, so it becomes completely useless in that case. Or in certain other ways it might, you know, develop more\u2014a higher percentage of it, a higher concentration, would become, like, something like chlorine gas, which, of course, is dangerous."]},{"begin":"455.400","end":"483.320","lines":["So the reason it\u2019s not sort of everywhere is that it\u2019s really hard to, like, manufacture and bottle this thing and keep it exactly what it is and have the conditions be exactly right. And there\u2019s been some changes over the past several years where more companies are sort of figuring out that puzzle and making it more available to consumers, as opposed to just something that is used in, like, commercial and industrial cleaning contexts, where there\u2019s more control over how that product is managed."]},{"begin":"483.320","end":"502.920","lines":["Yeah, well, and one of the things you mentioned in your piece is that, especially during the peak pandemic era, there were some countries and, you know, settings and institutions where this was almost being used to sort of fumigate people on their way in and out of shared spaces. What do we know about how effective it actually is in that context?"]},{"begin":"502.920","end":"541.200","lines":["So I think, in that context, it was pretty much seen, like, maybe it\u2019s not that effective to disinfect a person [laughs] in that way. And I think, you know, what, what\u2019s really interesting is this is a great product, or it\u2019s a great molecule, to be used on surfaces and things like that. But, you know, spraying it in the air in that way, is that really that effective? Not really, especially when we\u2019re dealing with infectious, like, respiratory illnesses, where you\u2019re looking at things that are airborne or through droplets. And I think, in those cases, the sort of, you know, fogging it everywhere has been proved, like, not that effective. And what you\u2019re really trying to do when you fog a room is get, like, even distribution ..."]},{"begin":"541.200","end":"541.480","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"541.480","end":"548.520","lines":["On all types of surfaces in the room, so I don\u2019t think there was much, like\u2014I think during the pandemic we were sort of throwing spaghetti at the wall ..."]},{"begin":"548.520","end":"548.800","lines":["Sure."]},{"begin":"548.800","end":"552.320","lines":["And trying all sorts of things, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll see that going forward."]},{"begin":"552.320","end":"553.400","lines":["Yeah, makes sense."]},{"begin":"553.400","end":"579.920","lines":["So you mentioned that different companies are finding solutions for the instability of this compound, but you also mentioned in your piece that there are a lot of brands marketing hypochlorous acid\u2014like I said, I feel like I\u2019ve seen it everywhere\u2014that maybe aren\u2019t actually solving the stability problem and are maybe ultimately selling people saltwater. Could you talk a little bit more about what consumers should be on the lookout for?"]},{"begin":"579.920","end":"605.320","lines":["I think what\u2019s so fascinating is that this has been used as, you know, something in, like, wound care and medical contexts for a long time, and now you\u2019re seeing that product enter a market that is regulated in a completely different way and in a, you know, far less rigorous way. We all know that there\u2019s, like, not that much oversight [laughs] when it comes to what people can call things in the beauty industry and how they\u2019re marketed."]},{"begin":"605.320","end":"638.640","lines":["So I think what\u2019s fascinating is there are, like, legitimate cases where we wanna be looking at: \u201cWhat is this thing really good for?\u201d And I think there are a lot of really promising potential uses for it. I just think right now, when something goes the route of, like, you know, getting made into a product that anyone can really make and bottle and sell, the thing that I get a little\u2014that would make me skeptical are some of the products that have other additives. So if you\u2019re putting hypochlorous acid in a bottle and then you\u2019re adding, like, essential oils or all sorts of other things, that\u2019s gonna really affect the formulation ..."]},{"begin":"638.640","end":"638.760","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"638.760","end":"659.840","lines":["And its stability. So I think, like, if you want to use this as a toner or facial spray, you know, for treating acne or eczema or something to put in your gym bag to spray your face, like, after the gym, just look for something that is, like, a pure formulation. You don\u2019t need all these other additives, and they can actually potentially harm the product."]},{"begin":"659.840","end":"673.200","lines":["So I think that\u2019s, like, the main thing that I would look out for. And you don\u2019t need unnecessary things. Like, it doesn\u2019t need to be made out of pink Himalayan sea salt [laughs]. Like, that\u2019s just something that\u2019s, you know, a distraction from the actual use of the product."]},{"begin":"673.200","end":"677.160","lines":["And there are also products that allow people to make this on their own, right?"]},{"begin":"677.160","end":"727.200","lines":["Right. You know, I didn\u2019t try any of those products for myself, but I think it\u2019s really interesting. There\u2019s versions of this, right? You take something that\u2019s done in an industrial context, and you shrink it down to, like, a countertop-sized device, and, you know, there\u2019s no reason, really, why this shouldn\u2019t work. And I think if you\u2019re someone who takes, like, the cleaning of your house really seriously or you\u2019ve just had something like norovirus sweep through your house, could this be a really interesting application? I think so, and I think what\u2019s great about it is that, you know, you can\u2019t put Clorox bleach everywhere, on all surfaces. With hypochlorous acid there\u2019s just a lot more applications, not just in surfaces, where it\u2019s not gonna harm it and where it\u2019s going to be effective, but also, of course, like, on your skin. So if you have pets and kids, it\u2019s not the same concern as spraying bleach everywhere."]},{"begin":"727.200","end":"729.840","lines":["Have you been using hypochlorous acid yourself?"]},{"begin":"729.840","end":"736.400","lines":["I have been.

I do often spray my face and my hands."]},{"begin":"748.520","end":"790.640","lines":["The number one thing that this story sort of informed me about when I was reporting is, like, as with all disinfectants, you have to let them sit for a little bit. And hypochlorous acid on hard, nonporous surfaces still requires, like, 30 to 60 seconds to be, like, really, really effective at killing everything. But if you think about the way that we clean surfaces in our lives or even spray our hands, are you letting something sit on your hands for 60 seconds? Are they saturated? I used to clean my phone with, you know, whatever I could find. But I would spray it on and then sort of immediately wipe it off. And so what I\u2019ve learned is that however effective your disinfectant is, you also have to be using it in the right way."]},{"begin":"790.640","end":"791.120","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"791.120","end":"805.720","lines":["So I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at, like [laughs], spraying my hands, really soaking them, and then letting them sit for a minute, and then I\u2019ll, like, wipe off the rest, and I feel like that wiping action is also really good at physically removing things [laughs] that might be there."]},{"begin":"805.720","end":"821.200","lines":["Yeah.
