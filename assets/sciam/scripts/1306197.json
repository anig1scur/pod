It\u2019s overwhelming evidence that if you take away children\u2019s opportunities for independent activity, they\u2019re not going to learn how to be independent, and that\u2019s going to lead them to be anxious and depressed, fearful about the future and all the things that we\u2019re seeing now."

By 2019 death by suicide had become the second-leading cause of death for those between age 10 and 24. But this mental health decline may have been decades in the making. And according to a team of researchers, it\u2019s partly because we\u2019re not giving kids the independence they need. For Science, Quickly, I\u2019m Joseph Polidoro.\u00a0 [CLIP: Music]\u00a0"

      "author": "Gray",
      "text": ": I think that the real crisis is that young people are losing a sense of, \u201cI can solve problems, I can deal with bumps in the road of life.\u201d And the way the children learn to do these things is through play where they are responsible to solve their own problems. They negotiate with their peers. They figure out how to solve quarrels among themselves. If somebody gets hurt, they figure out what to do about being hurt."

      "text": "When kids are allowed to make decisions and solve problems, they exercise what\u2019s called their internal locus of control. They begin to feel they have control over experiences and their lives, rather than experiences controlling them. Gray and his team cite work by psychologist Jean Twenge. She observed a dramatic increase in anxiety and depression from the 1960s through the 1990s. During the same timeframe, say Gray and his team, Twenge also reported a steep decline in internal locus of control. Gray says this correlation likely suggests that the decline in internal locus of control helps explain the mental health decline.\u00a0"

    {
      "author": "Gray",
      "text": ": There\u2019s evidence for people of all ages that having a weak internal locus control is predictive of future anxiety and depression. If you believe that anything can happen at any time and you can\u2019t do anything about it, that\u2019s a pretty anxiety-provoking view of life."

    {
      "author": "Polidoro: ",
      "text": "Control is also central to another set of established research, called self-determination theory. This research shows that children and adults have three basic psychological needs. If they\u2019re not fulfilled, we\u2019re not happy."

    {
      "author": "Gray: ",
      "text": "The first of those needs is autonomy. The sense that we have some freedom to choose what we\u2019re going to do, that we\u2019re in charge of our own life. The second of these needs is competence. Not only am I free to choose what I want to do, but I can do it. And the third is relatedness. It\u2019s also important that I have other people on my side on this. Connection with peers by this theory\u00a0 is an extremely important contributor to the sense of well-being."

In every one of these cultures as far as have been studied, children have an enormous amount of freedom and also an enormous amount of responsibility. There\u2019s higher expectations of what children can do."

      "author": "Polidoro",
      "text": ": These anthropological findings suggest that from an evolutionary perspective, independent activity, personal responsibility, and self-initiated exploration and learning ideally begin at an early age. It\u2019s a very convincing case, especially for anyone who remembers adolescents with paper routes, grade-school kids walking to school unsupervised, and kids of all ages playing together outside. But is the data there?\u00a0 As Gray and his co-authors make very clear, they\u2019re presenting correlational evidence, albeit from many, many sources. And relying on correlations makes some scientists uneasy."

      "author": "Twenge",

We also know from several recent studies that these increases in anxiety and loneliness among teens are worldwide. That helps us rule out a lot of U.S.-based explanations around politics or school shootings or any of these other things because we see very, very similar patterns in other countries around the world.\u00a0"

      "author": "Twenge",
      "text": ": That\u2019s just not correct. Social media is not just an individual issue. Social media is social. It has an impact at the level of the group. Take a kid who doesn\u2019t have social media. Are they going to be able to live like it\u2019s 1988 and go out with their friends? No. Who are they going to go out with\u2014because everybody else is on TikTok or Instagram at home. The whole social norm changed. These are group-level effects."

The correlation between childhood lead exposure and adult IQ is 0.11\u2014about half the size. So again, I think that really makes that case that there are not small effects."

You\u2019d have to frame the argument differently for it to line up with the time sequence and acknowledge some of the tradeoffs involved. Most public health experts would say that it\u2019s good that not as many high school students are drinking alcohol and having sex. Those independent activities trends are not all bad. There\u2019s trade-offs involved in them\u2013they\u2019re not all good either.\u00a0"

Since there seem to be several factors in this mental health decline, as all of these researchers agree, there may be a number of necessary interventions.

Mental health is more than the absence of mental illness. It\u2019s just that we are such a reactive society. We tend to think there\u2019s nothing wrong until somebody breaks down in terms of a medical category and that\u2019s simply not true. Right now, I can tell you even among U.S. college students, it\u2019s an appalling rate of 30 percent to 40 percent of college students who aren\u2019t mentally ill, but they\u2019re not flourishing. They\u2019re in that middle category \u201clanguishing.\u201d And that\u2019s our college students."
