      "text": "Now\u00a0the Arctic wasn\u2019t as chilly then as it is today. But it was below freezing, with temps dipping down to around 14 degrees Fahrenheit, occasional bouts of snowfall\u00a0and, of course, four months of winter darkness. If living in those conditions seems daunting, so was obtaining the study samples."

      "text": "In order to get and reach our field sites, we actually have to drive from Fairbanks, about 500 miles north up to Prudhoe Bay and the oil field. From there, we board small planes and helicopters, and we fly out to our field site. And then we put together a couple of boats. And then we use the rivers up there as our highways."

      "text": "We wash it, we screen it, we sieve it, and we collect and save every particle larger than half a millimeter. And what we do then is inspect every grain, grain by grain by grain, under a microscope, looking for these little remains, the bones and the teeth of what we now understand to be baby dinosaurs."

      "author": "Hopkin",
      "text": "These itty bitty bones are way too tiny to have come from an adult dinosaur\u2026even a wee one\u2026and they lack the features one would expect to see in teeth and bones from an animal that\u2019s developmentally mature. So far, Druckenmiller and his team have dug up species from seven different dino families: from big duck-billed dinos, ceretopsians, and tyrannosaurs to smaller thescelosaurs, leptoceratops, dromaeosaurs, and troodontids. The findings are described in the journal Current Biology. Now, why does the presence of baby bones suggest that the dinosaurs weren\u2019t just passing through?"

      "author": "Druckenmiller",
      "text": "The reason we think they were year-round residents is because if you reproduce in the arctic, you have really a very limited time of year to do your business."

      "text": "So if you laid an egg in the spring, and that egg took five to six months to hatch, which is what we understand the incubation period to be for some dinosaurs, such as duck-billed dinosaurs, then that means that your eggs are hatching out at the end of the summer."

    {
      "author": "Hopkin",
      "text": "Some of the smaller species, like thescelosaurs and leptoceratops, could have burrowed underground and hibernated. And other researchers have unearthed evidence that some larger dino species actually sported feathers, including young T. rexes and their shaggy coated cousin, Yutyrannus huali."

      "author": "Druckenmiller",
