But supermassive black holes are, as the name implies, massively large\u2014which makes them easier to detect than their relatively tiny cousins: so-called stellar-mass black holes, which are closer in mass to our sun."

      "text": "Mark Gieles is an astrophysicist with the University of Barcelona and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies. He says Palomar 5 is best known for its spectacular star trails, studded with stars ejected from the cluster over the last 11.5 billion years. But those trails turned out to be a critical clue, tipping Gieles and his team off to a large mob of black holes. You see, the astronomers set out to determine how the trails formed. To do that, they ran more than three dozen computer simulations in which they\u2019d let different configurations of black holes bully around hundreds of thousands of stars for about 11 billion years.\u00a0"

But it also suggested Palomar 5 likely harbors more than 100 black holes\u2014that\u2019s three times as many as the astronomers expected to find there. The details appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.
