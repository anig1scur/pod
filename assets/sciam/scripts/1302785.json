      "text": "But she was curious to find out why\u2014so she and her colleagues asked 103 volunteers to complete a series of math problems. Unbeknownst to the participants, there was a quick shortcut to solve all the problems. (Sixteen of the volunteers figured that out and were excluded from the rest of the study.) The volunteers who didn\u2019t determine the secret were asked to emulate Dali\u2019s method\u2014but pinching a plastic bottle with their fingertips\u00a0rather than a key. Some took a Dali-style micro nap, some napped longer, and others didn\u2019t nap at all.\u00a0\u00a0 After the snooze, the researchers asked all the volunteers to do hundreds more of these math problems. And they found that volunteers who took micro naps were nearly three times as likely to figure out the problem-solving trick, compared to those who didn\u2019t nap at all."

      "text": "That\u2019s a pretty massive result.\u00a0 We think, maybe in this phase, you have the best of the two worlds:\u00a0sleep and wake. So you lose control of your thoughts. So you can have loose associations\u2014make distant associations between different memories\u2014and that could be helpful for creativity. But at the same time, you keep some awareness that might help you to recognize when you have a great idea."

In his book, he describes a variation of his method\u00a0in which he instructs the reader to, quote, \u201ceat three dozen sea urchins, gathered on one of the last two days that precede the full moon.\u201d He specified that \u201cthese sea urchins should be eaten preferably in the spring\u2014May is a good month.\u201d Clearly, the great painter has left scientists with much to investigate.\u00a0 [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]"
