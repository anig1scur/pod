But in 16th century Italy \u2014 as women assembling and talking about reproductive labor and justice, we could most certainly could have been tried."

    {
      "author": "Bose: ",
      "text": "Sylvia actually argues that the creation of capitalism in Europe was a motivating factor in the rise of witch hunts. As she and other scholars have argued, expansions of capitalism also caused women to lose their social standing and their land. Particularly vulnerable were older women. By the 1600s \u2014 an edict is issued. It has to do with witches \u2014 and their apparent ability to stop reproduction."
