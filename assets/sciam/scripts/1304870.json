They are stuffed into cupboards. Under beds. Jammed in kitchen cabinets."},{"author":"Madusree Mukerjee","text":"Can I have a tiny bit of cooking oil?"},{"author":"Silvia Federici","text":"Do you want a book?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Two other editors from Scientific American and I are trying to find this famous Italian feminist scholar\u00a0 some olive oil, but we can\u2019t find any. Only more books, which Sylvia keeps excitedly pointing out."},{"author":"Federici","text":"That booklet was very important for me, because it spoke about the witch hunt."},{"author":"Bose","text":"We\u2019re at a dinner we\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe witch frittata party.\u201d"},{"author":"Cross talk: \u2014'","text":"I brought red wine."},{"author":"Federici","text":"\u2014\u00a0Oh, perfect."},{"author":"Bose","text":"To clarify\u00a0 \u2014 yes, we\u2019re a group of women (and Silvia\u2019s philosopher husband George) sitting in a circle. We are in fact eating a frittata. But we are not, at least by any of our admission, witches. But in 16th century Italy \u2014 as women assembling and talking about reproductive labor and justice, we could most certainly could have been tried."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Today \u2014 we\u2019ll talk to two witch hunting scholars \u2014 and take you a journey from the middle ages in Italy, to Salem, Massachusetts \u2014 to the present day, to look at some surprising links between reproductive health, labor, and witch hunts. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Tulika Bose."},{"author":"Federici","text":"So they arrest a woman. And then they torture her to death, until she has revealed all the names of the other."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Sylvia\u2019s actually telling me about the horrifying history of the change in meaning of the word \u201cgossip.\u201d"},{"author":"Federici","text":"For the first century and a half, witchcraft is seen as a collective crime. The idea that when women get together, they do something that is not good."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Sylvia Federici is one of history\u2019s most famous feminist scholars. And for one night, I got to pick her brain about witch hunts. But there\u2019s something else I want to know \u2014 as scholar of domestic labor, how does that relate to \u2014 witch hunts?"},{"author":"Federici","text":"I wanted to understand what it been the path from the pre-capitalist Europe, to capitalist Europe."},{"author":"Bose","text":"It all goes back to the Black Death in Europe. Around this time \u2014 the mid 1300\u2019s \u2014"},{"author":"Federici","text":"There\u00a0was a hunger for labor, because so many had died. it creates a whole new concern, you know, about marriage, about reproduction, children."},{"author":"Bose","text":"This co-incides with the rise of certain heretic movements \u2014 like the Cathars, who contradicted edicts of the\u00a0 established church."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Now, let\u2019s fast forward to the 1400\u2019s."},{"author":"Federici","text":"Witchcraft appears first as a form of heresy."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But there\u2019s more than meets the eye in this story. While this story is about witch hunts, it\u2019s also about controlling women\u2019s bodies for the creation of a labor market \u2014 and the creation of a peasant class in post feudal Europe."},{"author":"Federici","text":"By the 1500's, you'll have colonization. And this begins to bring silver into Europe. And the more silver comes, the more enclosures, the more people are kicked off the land, and the land is turned to commercial use."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Sylvia actually argues that the creation of capitalism in Europe was a motivating factor in the rise of witch hunts. As she and other scholars have argued, expansions of capitalism also caused women to lose their social standing and their land. Particularly vulnerable were older women. By the 1600s \u2014 an edict is issued. It has to do with witches \u2014 and their apparent ability to stop reproduction."},{"author":"Federici","text":"There is a Pope that accuses witches\u00a0basically of abortion and contraception."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And it\u2019s often women who were knowledgable about reproductive health care who were targeted for witchcraft."},{"author":"Federici","text":"Women were the ones who cured. They were the ones who, in addition to farming, had the herbal garden. Because of the children because of the reproduction. They were the one who knew about the herbs. So they they immediately suspected."},{"author":"Bose","text":"According to Sylvia,\u00a0 the accusation of witchcraft relied on targeting people who allegedly interfered with procreation \u2014 including abortion \u2014 because poor workers were valuable form of capital."},{"author":"Federici","text":"Many many\u00a0times in when they burned women, they also burn gay people together."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That, by the way, was for the \u201ccrime\u201d of not procreating. This theme around women\u2019s roles and domestic labor also shows up in the Salem witch trials. I spoke to Alice Cantor, a writer who happens to be a descendant of a woman tried for witchcraft."},{"author":"Alice Cantor: ","text":"Her name was Martha Carrier. She was seven months pregnant when she got married. So that's sort of a big Puritan don't do that. She was known for being sort of this outspoken, very,\u00a0 like had a habit of yelling at her neighbors kind of lady."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Side note \u2013 this is around the time I found out about a medieval torture device called a scold\u2019s bridle, once placed over women\u2019s heads to keep them from talking, but that\u2019s another story."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Now, while Salem didn\u2019t have the same obsession with killing people for the crime of preventing procreation \u2014 if you were tried for witchcraft, Alice said it was still related in some way to reproductive labor."},{"author":"Cantor","text":"If we zoom out, and we think, from a sort of broader perspective about what reproduction is, you know, not just pregnancy and giving birth, but all of the work that\u00a0 it takes to keep someone alive and the care work that is part of reproductive labor, that aspect does appear in Salem, because this care work was extremely gendered, you know, it was women's work."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Not only that \u2014 but there were still incidents of women being tried for aiding in abortion."},{"author":"Cantor","text":"Some of them were killed for aiding, you know, were\u00a0midwives who provided abortions or contraceptives."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Alice had something to say about witch hunts in the present day too."},{"author":"Cantor","text":"Witch hunts are not over. At least 1000, probably in the low 1000s of people are accused of witchcraft, and suffer violence as a result, whether they're killed, tortured, expelled from their homes, or ostracized in the present."},{"author":"Bose","text":"You can read more about modern witch hunts in a new Scientific American article by Alice Cantor and Sylvia Federici.There\u2019s a lot we can take away from a historical study of witch hunts, especially in climate."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But I'll leave you with something Alice said."},{"author":"Cantor","text":"The witch hunts of the past are echoing in the present."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Thanks for Listening.
