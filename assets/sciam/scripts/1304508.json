Last September\u00a0NASA\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART\u2014a spacecraft the size of a golf cart\u2014smashed into a small asteroid called Dimorphos, actually altering its trajectory around another asteroid called Didymos in our first-ever test of planetary defense. [CLIP: NASA:\u00a0\u201cFour, three, two, one. Oh my gosh. Oh wow. Awaiting individual confirmation. And we have impact! A triumph for humanity in the name of planetary defense!\u201d]"

      "text": "Right. Ideally\u2014and we\u2019ll get into actuality in a moment\u2014this is as simple as playing pool: shoot one billiard ball into another, and the target ball goes flying. The more momentum you can transfer, the more motion you get. So you want to hit near dead\u00a0center. And\u00a0in DART\u2019s case, it was targeted for the \u201cleading\u201d sunward side of Dimorphos, which it struck at a speed of more than 14,000 mph. That\u2019s about three quarters the speed of General Zod\u2019s spaceship in Zach Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel movie. [CLIP: General Zod:\u00a0\u201cNow. Kneel before Zod.\u201d]"

That helps with gauging DART\u2019s effects: think of Dimorphos a bit like the second hand on a clock where Didymos is the hour hand or the clock itself. It\u2019s easier to see small changes by watching how the smaller object moves."

The fact that DART made a dent at all really comes down to its high-velocity impact, which we already said was 14,000 miles per hour. And all this took place after a deep-space voyage to the impact point, more than seven million miles from Earth."

What are some of the new details about this impact that have been found? And what surprised scientists? What was NASA\u2019s original goal here?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Lee: ",
      "text": "That\u2019s a great question Tulika. And the answer was that the surprise was how well it worked. NASA\u2019s official criterion for success was shifting Dimorphos\u2019s orbit by just 73 seconds. Initial predictions \u2013 if it was actually a billiard ball, for instance, all solid rock \u2013 predictions were that maybe DART would nudge it off by about 7 minutes. Instead we got 33, 33 minutes!"

    },
    {
      "author": "Lee: ",
      "text": "Yeah! And the difference is due to Dimorphos not being a billiard ball at all. It's a loosely bound rubble pile. as DART's closing images showed. So when DART slammed into it, it ejected a huge plume, a long tail of debris, containing more than 2 million pounds of stuff, which imparted recoil, basically, to Didymos. It's a bit like a kick from a shotgun."
    },
    {
      "author": "Bose",
      "text": ":\u00a0Oh, wow. Well that really helps me visualize it a little bit more. So DART was this $330 million spaceship the size of a golf cart \u2014 and it was completely obliterated by this asteroid in a matter of mere microseconds. Scientists seemed pretty confident that this was a success \u2014 but what else would we need in order to ensure that any more dangerous asteroids headed for earth don\u2019t obliterate us?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Lee: ",
      "text": "Great question, Tulika. What we really need to have is better situational awareness. How manyof these objects are out there? What are they made of? Where are they?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bose:'",
      "text": "And uh, who\u2019s working on that now? Lots of different people. The key is to get a catalog of different sizes of objects, their different orbits, maybe even what they're made of and figure out which ones are the most threatening. So in terms of certain near term projects we've got Hera, is the first dimension. That's a project from the European Space Agency. It's named after the Greek goddess who was married to Zeus, I believe, the queen of the gods."

    {
      "author": "Bose:'",
      "text": "The Queen!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Billings",
      "text": ":\u00a0The Queen, the Queen.\u00a0Now, Hera was originally supposed to arrive about the same time as DART at Dimorphos at Didymos. But instead, due to delays, it is now not launching until late next year, it's going to arrive sometime in 2026. But that's still going to tell us a whole lot more about the aftermath of this epochal impact. Now, there are other things to mention as well. One project I'm excited about is NASA's NEO\u00a0surveyor, the Near Earth Objects Surveyor Space Telescope. That is an infrared space telescope that's meant to launch maybe sometime in 2028. And it will be a very big step towards creating this catalog of objects, and getting a better sense of what's really out there and what the threats are. And on the ground there\u2019s something similar to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. One thing that's very important for this mission is it will be doing the same kind of work from the ground. It will be taking these full, panoramic, high resolution images of the sky multiple times per night, each and every night making almost a high definition movie of the heavens above. And it'll be able to see little points of light moving around, some of which could be Earth threatening asteroids."

Lee, what are you looking forward to the most to finding out in the near future?"

      "author": "Billings",
      "text": ":\u00a0Well, honestly, I kind of considered Didymos and Dimorphos a little done and dusted. We\u2019ve already smacked the space rock, we've seen what's happened. I'm interested in getting this catalogue. I'm interested in knowing more about the properties of a wide diversity of asteroids, because it may not be a rubble pile that comes at us every time. What if it's a big ball of metal? What if it's made of ice? I don't know."

That said, I have to say, I don't think this is going to be enough to save us. There's a lot of situations where something could still hit us real hard and fast and DART definitely\u00a0wouldn\u2019t save us."
