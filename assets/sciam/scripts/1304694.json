      "author": "Moskowitz: ",
      "text": "A flat curve suggests that stars on the outside of the galaxy are moving just as fast as stars on the inside, which isn\u2019t actually what you\u2019d expect at all. Basic Newtonian physics suggests that actually, as you move toward the outskirts, the stars would start to slow down as they orbit the center of the galaxy. When Rubin started seeing that these outside stars were still speeding around, it really offered the first strong evidence that there must be a lot of hidden mass extending way out beyond the stars we can see with our eyes."

    {
      "author": "Bose",
