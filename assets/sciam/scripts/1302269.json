A couple billion years ago\u2014about three billion to be a little more precise\u2014the earth was a very different place. It had vast oceans and almost no oxygen in the atmosphere. It was a place where bacteria ruled. Some of these bacteria used photosynthesis to power themselves, kind of like plants. But they did it in a strange way: by harnessing light and stealing electrons from iron. Fast-forward about two billion years, and those bacteria still exist today. They\u2019re called photoferrotrophs, and for decades, scientists thought they were pretty rare."

In 2015, on a whim, Bose collected some vials of marine sediment from Woods Hole, Mass., and brought them home to her lab in Missouri. Her students slowly parsed out the individual strains of bacteria, and they started testing them, one by one, trying to figure out if any of them still had that ancient metabolism. Bose still remembers the day two of her students came into her office with the results."

      "text": "All 15 bacterial strains were photoferrotrophs. Maybe, they started thinking, this trait wasn\u2019t that rare after all. The study appears in the [ISME Journal]:\u00a0Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology. [Dinesh Gupta et al., Photoferrotrophy and phototrophic extracellular electron uptake is common in the marine anoxygenic phototroph Rhodovulum sulfidophilum] A big reason why they care\u2014beyond just basic scientific curiosity\u2014is the fact that these microbes are vacuuming up carbon dioxide as they photosynthesize."
