And from the stars and heavens, we draw inspiration and even religion. But the night skies have also taught us how to keep time and coordinate our days and seasons.\u00a0 We have long used the night skies to live our lives more predictably and make our way through the world more purposefully."

Seeing birds fly in front of the moon or hearing the calls from above, I found really thrilling because it felt like I was tapping into this vast mysterious pulse-of-the-planet phenomenon that was just so much bigger than me."

On any given night during migration, there might be thousands of birds flying in the skies above you and tens or hundreds of millions more moving across the continent. We still don\u2019t fully understand the true scope of this mass movement. But now science is turning to machines to unlock the secrets of nocturnal migration."

      "text": "The nighttime bird surveillance network all started with one six-foot sound dish, an expensive studio microphone on reel-to-reel tape and a bunch of hay bales more than 60 years ago. In time, the mics got a lot smaller, and the network grew and grew. Today people all over the world have created a vast, informal network of night sky listeners. Interpreting all of these data, however, has created a new challenge. It\u2019s one that scientists at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology are tackling head-on."

I was really intrigued by the puzzle of bird identification, that I could learn the tricks to identifying a bird and then be able to put that knowledge to use outside in the real world when I saw a flash of color go by or, later on, heard a sound."

      "text": "And now he\u2019s busy solving the puzzle of how to quickly and accurately analyze thousands of hours and many terabytes of nocturnal migration data. But more people are joining the nighttime surveillance network. More and more data are flying in from nighttime listening stations. Benjamin is one of the few researchers trying to get arms around all of it. And he has a big data problem on his hands. A single night of recording produces anywhere from eight to 12 hours of audio that is about one to three gigabytes in size. And that\u2019s only at one location. Hundreds of people are recording migration all across the U.S. and beyond. Nightly audio intelligence from the network then needs to be combed through to find moments where migratory birds emitted nocturnal flight calls, or NFCs, above the microphone. During especially busy nights, that can mean more than 20,000 NFCs in a single recording from one site. Then comes the problem of deciphering those calls."

      "author": "Van Doren: ",
      "text": "Flight calls are very short vocalizations. They might last a fifth or even a twentieth of a second, and so it takes a lot of skill and practice to learn how to identify these calls, especially by ear\u2014something I personally don\u2019t feel that confident at. And processing hours and hours of passive audio recordings can be extremely tedious and difficult."

      "text": "We have hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of hours of recordings that we may want to analyze, which is just way too much for the small number of skilled humans who can do this sort of thing by hand. So ... we really need computers to do some of the work for us to be able to get any useful, large-scale information out of these long passive audio recordings. And so that\u2019s why we turn to machine learning."

      "text": "One area of machine learning is computer vision, which we can use to distinguish dogs from cats in pictures, for example\u2014or, in our case, distinguish different birds on audio recordings by feeding the computer not the raw sound itself but actually the visual representation of sound as a spectrogram, really a picture that represents the sound."

    },
    {
      "author": "Job: ",
      "text": "So if we want a computer to learn how to identify dogs in pictures, you feed it many thousands of images of different dogs: small ones, large ones, dogs of all colors, dogs in different poses. Eventually, after enough training like this, the computer can recognize if a dog is present in most any picture you present it."

      "author": "Van Doren: ",
      "text": "If we train our models well enough, it can give us an accurate, or at least useful, estimate of the numbers of birds that were passing overhead, which species they were. And so very quickly, perhaps 300 [times] faster than real time, we can begin to process thousands of hours of audio in an efficient manner with these kinds of tools."

      "text": "If you\u2019re a birder, you may already be familiar with this technology. The Lab of Ornithology added a feature to its Merlin Bird ID app called \u201cSound ID\u201d. Essentially, if you hear a bird outside and want to know what it is, you can tap this feature in the Merlin app and point your phone\u2019s microphone toward the singing bird. After analyzing the spectrogram of the bird\u2019s song, the app spits out its best guess as to what species of bird is singing in front of you. It\u2019s highly accurate and really useful, kind of like Shazam for birds. I asked Benjamin if people could use this feature to identify NFCs."

    {
      "author": "Van Doren: ",
      "text": "The tools and underlying technology behind something like Merlin, they can be applied to the flight call problem, this flight call challenge, but as you say it is trickier because there\u2019s less information encoded in a 50-millisecond chip than in [a] several-second song of a Northern Cardinal, for example. So it makes it more difficult for the computer to make the identification accurately, but when you provide enough data, the computer gets good enough that it can hopefully overcome those types of shortcomings. And so one thing that I\u2019m working on right now is trying to take that next step to develop a system based on some of the same technology that underlies Merlin but applied specifically to the challenge of identifying nocturnal flight calls."

      "author": "Van Doren: ",
      "text": "We currently have a poor understanding of what birds are doing at the species level when they\u2019re actively migrating, and flight calls can give us a window into how birds are interacting with the landscape, how they\u2019re interacting with human-dominated areas like cities, and importantly, tell us how different species are behaving differently in response to the environment, to the landscape and also with each other. I think there\u2019s a lot that we have yet to learn about how birds are interacting during migration. They\u2019re saying something up there, and in my view, there\u2019s a lot we don't understand about what exactly they\u2019re communicating as they are participating in these journeys of thousands of miles. So being able to monitor birds at such a large scale will provide us the kind of information we need to make informed conservation decisions going forward. [CLIP: Theme music]"
