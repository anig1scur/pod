Shouldn\u2019t be an issue, right? Seems like an easy thing to avoid doing. Unfortunately it seems like some folks may disagree. The \u200b\u200bUnited States Department of Defense has sounded the alarm on a potential threat from Russia in the form of a hypothetical program aimed at putting a nuclear weapon into orbit. While there\u2019s no evidence that such a device is on its way into space, let alone already up there, I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019d all rather be sure that Russia, like, definitely wasn\u2019t going to do that. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves\u2014what actually happens when a nuke goes off in space? Thanks to the hubris of humankind, that\u2019s a question we can answer from experience. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Associate news editor Allison Parshall is joining me today to tell us more. So, Allison, what are we talking about when we talk about nukes in space?"},{"author":"Allison Parshall","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s definitely worth being specific. But, like, what we\u2019re talking [about] is specifically about nukes in orbit. I mean, there\u2019s also the question of nuclear power in space. We power satellites with nuclear power. There\u2019s some fun tales\u2014and by fun, I mean distressing\u2014from, you know, the 1960s and 1970s about attempts to power satellites with nuclear fuel. In 1978 a Russian satellite that was powered by a nuclear reactor failed, and debris fell\u2014 scattered over Canada. So that was fun. But if we\u2019re talking specifically about nuclear weapons positioned in orbit to potentially be exploded in orbit, that\u2019s, like, a whole separate question. That\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve necessarily had before, and it would be super bad. So let\u2019s not do it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, no\u2014100 percent agree. I think we can all safely end up on the same side of that debate. So what is the difference between a nuclear explosion on Earth and one in space?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I mean, we\u2019re really familiar with what a nuclear explosion would look like on Earth, right? Like, we have the\u2014the United States dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, killing over 200,000 people, and we\u2019ve had hundreds of nuclear weapons tests since. And you\u2019ve probably seen what this looks like in movies and TV shows\u2014you know, Fallout, Oppenheimer, Dr. Strangelove. You\u2019ve got that first fireball that just kind of vaporizes everything around it within a certain radius. That fireball causes a shock wave that can be really devastating: It can level buildings. It can start firestorms. And then both of those things result in the really famous, distinctive mushroom cloud that erupts over where the bomb was dropped. And then, of course, you have the thing that is probably really concerning in the long term, which is the nuclear fallout. You\u2019ve got all of that radiation that lingers for decades. It can kill in minutes, or it can kill in decades. And in space almost none of this happens because we\u2019re in somewhere with very little atmosphere, so there can'\u2019 be a fireball, there can\u2019t be a shock wave, and there can\u2019t be a mushroom cloud."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So what you get instead is just so much radiation spewing out from the explosion. You get that radiation in the form of gamma rays and x-rays, and those can travel really far because, like I said, there\u2019s little to no atmosphere to interfere with them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"We know that satellites in the line of sight would be damaged or taken offline entirely by that initial blast. It would create an electromagnetic pulse that would fry unshielded electronics within a certain radius on Earth and in space. And perhaps most concerningly, we know that we would get this belt of radiation that is similar to something called a Van Allen belt. A Van Allen belt exists naturally in space\u2014satellite operators try to avoid having their satellites go through them because it can damage them. This artificial belt of radiation loops out from the Earth, and it can last for years."},{"author":"Fetlman","text":"Wow. Okay, so, uh, not great\u2014something worth avoiding. So how do we know that this is what would happen if it\u2019s so bad and worth avoiding?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I\u2019m glad you asked. This is a fascinating story. I did not know about this before I started reporting on it. I kinda can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know about it. But basically we tested this\u2014by we, I mean humanity\u2014the hubris of humanity ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Of course we did."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"The U.S. and the Soviet Union conducted over a dozen high-altitude tests of nuclear weapons between 1958 and 1962. The most famous of them\u2014I guess the most notorious, you could say\u2014was called Starfish Prime. It happened on July 8, 1962, at 11 P.M. local time, relative to Hawaii. It launched on a missile from Johnston Atoll, which is in the middle of the Pacific, not too far from Hawaii. It was detonated 250 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. So that\u2019s low-Earth orbit. It\u2019s where most satellites orbit today. It\u2019s where the International Space Station orbits today. And this bomb was 100 times stronger than the one the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow. Why?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Why? I mean, to test."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"To see what would happen\u2014okay, sure."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, to see what would happen. I mean, it\u2019s relevant now. But it\u2019s interesting\u2014people in Hawaii knew that this was going to happen. There are newspaper headlines from before the test that advertised the, quote, \u201cn-blast\u201d would be \u201cdazzling\u201d and that people might have a \u201cgood view,\u201d and people did have a good view."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And it seems like it was dazzling. The people who saw this from the Pacific describe auroras that are just unlike anything that I\u2019ve ever heard described. Basically the radiation from the blast excites molecules in our upper atmosphere, and depending on what those molecules are, you get different colors. And so accounts say that when the blast first happened, there was this startling flash of green that kind of lit the sky up like daylight, even though it was 11 P.M. And that green kind of faded to yellow, to orange and then settled on this eerie red. There\u2019s really startling pictures. I would recommend looking them up. Also, the electromagnetic pulse it generated knocked out about 300 streetlights in Oahu. And it doesn\u2019t seem like the scientists really expected any of this to happen. I mean, they certainly knew some of it\u2014this was not the first test. But it seems like the strength of it took scientists by surprise, as well as that belt of radiation that lingered for years. It also killed about a third of the satellites that were in orbit. It\u2019s nothing compared to the number we have now. It was maybe, like, two dozen satellites, about eight of which were killed or damaged. That included one called Telstar 1 that launched the next day after Starfish Prime. That thing got 100 times more radiation than they expected, and it was toast."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah. And a source I spoke with\u2014his name is Jonathan McDowell at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian\u2014he called Starfish Prime the, quote, \u201cposter child for why we don\u2019t like nukes blowing up in space,\u201d which, I think, is a fair summary."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That seems fair."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, and we know that the governments that were doing these kind of decided we shouldn\u2019t be doing this anymore because both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. signed on to the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, five years later, which forbade putting nuclear weapons\u2014or really, more generally, weapons of mass destruction\u2014into orbit."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yes. Speaking of that treaty, if I\u2019m understanding correctly, it\u2019s not totally clear how seriously Russia is considering putting a nuclear weapon into orbit\u2014if they\u2019re considering it at all. But some government officials in the U.S. certainly were concerned enough to talk about it publicly. So what\u2019s the actual worst-case scenario here?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I mean, I definitely is not clear the extent to which they\u2019re seriously doing this. One of the sources I spoke with said that, you know, this could just be a PowerPoint from some general, or it could be a serious program. But it might not necessarily be a serious program designed for them to actually\u2014endgame\u2014detonate a nuke in space. The State Department said that there was no, quote, \u201cimminent threat.\u201d So I don\u2019t want people to be afraid of a nuke off above their head. But, yeah, if this happened, it would be bad. Geopolitically it\u2019s the kind of thing that we spent a lot of the cold war worrying about\u2014just very escalatory. Of course, you worry about those tensions escalating even further into more nuclear exchanges and global thermonuclear war\u2014don\u2019t want that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, would love to avoid."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But as far as the direct effects of what you\u2019d see if this went off today, like I mentioned, it would be worse because there\u2019s more things in space now than there were in 1962. We have 10,000-ish satellites in orbit. Most of those are in low-Earth orbit. We\u2019ve got two space stations. Of those 10,000 satellites, 6,000 of them are Starlink satellites. Depending on the height and the strength of the blast and where it went off, you could expect a lot of those to be damaged or killed. They would effectively be turned into space junk\u2014just aimlessly floating without a real way to recover them. And it\u2019s not just inanimate satellites that we\u2019re worrying about. There are people in space. There\u2019s people on the International Space Station and China\u2019s Tiangong space station. An electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear weapon going off could mess with vital systems aboard. It could also leave the astronauts to be navigating a bunch of space junk, which could potentially harm the space stations. And the radiation itself, depending on where the blast went off, could be really directly harmful. I spoke with Victoria Samson. She works for the space sustainability [organization] Secure World Foundation. And she said that a nuclear blast in orbit could limit the safety of people on these space stations to mere hours or days. And she was citing this 2010 Department of Defense report. They tested 17 possible scenarios\u2014worst-case scenario showed 90 percent probability of death within two to three hours for people on the International Space Station."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And I\u2019m assuming we wouldn'\u2019 be in great shape on Earth to launch like a superfast rescue mission to ISS."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It\u2019s hard to say because the only thing that would really impact Earth would be the electromagnetic pulse\u2014like, people down here on the ground\u2014and it\u2019s possible that NASA could shield things from that: like, a shield of electronics would be fine. But we wouldn\u2019t want to go directly up into space, necessarily. We\u2019ve got all this radiation; it would be really dangerous. But as far as on Earth, we would be impacted by the effects of unshielded electronics being taken out, depending on where the blast went off, if the radius could be different. And interestingly, though, we wouldn\u2019t be hurt by the radiation itself. Like, I don\u2019t know about you, but the idea of a nuke going off, like, 200 miles above my head makes me worry about, like, radiation raining down on me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That would not happen because our atmosphere is super good at preventing that from happening. Basically we have the sun almost 100 million miles away from us, which is close in space terms, and it\u2019s spewing radiation at us all the time, and we only get, like, skin cancer sometimes. The fact that we exist now is thanks to the atmosphere."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And that atmosphere would protect us from the follies of humankind\u2014mostly."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Aw, thanks, atmosphere."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, thanks, atmosphere. That strikes me, too, because if a nuclear weapon went off 200 miles from where you\u2019re standing right now on the surface of the Earth, depending on weather conditions, you could be in real danger. But if it went off directly above your head at that distance, radiation-wise, you\u2019d be fine."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah\u2014GPS satellites?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Questionable. Interestingly, GPS\u2014the version we use in the United States\u2014started as a military project, and my source told me that we don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s shielded from radiation."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe GPS would be fine? I wouldn\u2019t count on it, though. I wouldn\u2019t count on anything. I mean, Starlink Internet, I would think it would go out."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Rough day for Elon."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Rough day for Elon."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what would it actually take humanity to recover from a blast like this?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I mean, I guess we could just abandon space. I mean, that\u2019s...."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"We try."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It seems pretty clear that that\u2019s not what we want to do. We\u2019d have to rebuild, probably, a lot of pieces of civil and commercial space programs\u2014probably Russia included, to the extent that it has much of a space program. But the U.S. in 2010\u2014the Department of Defense\u2014estimated that it would cost $45 billion to recover its assets. That was including the International Space Station as a sizable chunk, and that\u2019s set to be decommissioned in 2031 anyway. So, you know, maybe we just cut our losses. But even if you relaunched everything after that Van Allen belt has been dispersed, you would still have this minefield of dead and drifting satellites and other space junk to contend with."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, space junk is already a problem we\u2019re concerned about. I know it\u2019s something we\u2019ve discussed on the podcast before, and it would just be a mess."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It would just be a mess. Say you send $45 billion rebuilding everything, sending it all up into space\u2014who\u2019s to say that someone just doesn\u2019t set off another nuke?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you for helping me feel both a little better and a little worse about this story."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s a good summary."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But hopefully everyone will keep their nukes to themselves in the sky, on the ground, all around."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s perfect."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today.
