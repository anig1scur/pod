For the past two years we\u2019ve shared our staff favorites, but this year we\u2019ve decided to expand into two new lists: Scientific American\u2019s first-ever best nonfiction books and fiction books of the year."},{"author":"","text":"To take us through the selections we have Bri Kane, SciAm\u2019s associate books editor. Thanks so much for joining us today, Bri."},{"author":"Bri Kane","text":"Thanks, Kendra. I\u2019m so excited to talk to you today."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I\u2019m excited to have you here. Can you tell us a little bit about the process of getting [these book lists] together? What are some of the key things that you looked at?"},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean, this is Scientific American\u2019s first year doing a best fiction and best nonfiction of the year list; we\u2019ve had a very popular staff-favorites books list the last two years."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"So in trying to find the best fiction and the best nonfiction of a year it means doing a ton of research, which, thankfully, we\u2019re a bunch of good-natured nerds, and we love any excuse to research and any excuse to read more books. I mean, it was a great self-assigned homework project this year. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"","text":"So some of the most important things that we were looking at for every book is it had to have an exceptional voice in writing and an incredible story."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Even nonfiction needed to really catch our attention in the narrator\u2019s voice and the story that they were trying to tell us."},{"author":"","text":"Another thing that we looked at for every book\u2014obviously, we\u2019re Scientific American\u2014is: What\u2019s the science here? And science is a really broad umbrella, and we tried to have a really broad view of what we considered science, but every single book on our list has something that can appeal to a more science-minded reader, so I\u2019m really excited to showcase those books."},{"author":"","text":"And then every book has a little special je ne sais quoi\u2014that little sparkle that just catches your eye\u2014is the book that you just keep telling people about, even though you read it months and months ago, maybe. Those are the books that we really, like, found ourselves drawn to and were talking about with each other the most, and we wanted to talk to our audience about them."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That makes total sense, and I totally know how you feel. I think one of the books that I suggested was exactly in that [category] of just books that I was obsessed with and couldn\u2019t stop talking to people about. So can you tell us, starting with the nonfiction side, what are a couple of books that really topped your list?"},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean, one book that we have been talking about in our books group in our newsroom for a while now is Human Nature by Kate Marvel. This book shook me to my core. I mean, I have been following climate science and the changes to our environment for a long time now ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"But the way that Kate connects our current climate catastrophes with our history of literature and history of archaeology and just the whole world\u2014it was really beautiful to bring everything all the way back down to our feelings and being pissed off about climate change, being sad, trying to find hope in all of this darkness and also some humor along the way. I mean, it was a really, really special read for a lot of us, and it had that sparkle from the first page."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"It feels like a lot of climate books are often kind of depressing, and it\u2014the way you\u2019re talking about Human Nature is\u2014it wasn\u2019t necessarily just, like, a downer."},{"author":"Kane","text":"No, and I think you\u2019re right: a lot of books trying to cover this issue really bum you out, and it can be kind of a slog to get through. But I found Human Nature to be, like, a wild ride. I could not put it down once I started. I was shocked how much I loved it and how much I could not stop talking about it. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That\u2019s awesome, and I know that there\u2019s another book kind of in a similar vein in terms of, like, really loving it and not being able to put it down within the nonfiction category."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, They Poisoned the World by Mariah Blake is exceptional. I mean ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Wow, what a title."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, Andrea Gawrylewski, our chief newsletter editor, called it \u201can epic piece of science writing,\u201d and that is not a compliment that gets thrown around lightly around here. I mean, it was a really, really beautiful text that really took our minds to a whole new place in understanding PFAS [perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances], these forever chemicals ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"And the companies that are poisoning our communities around this country and what that means for our understanding of our place in this fight and the legacy that we\u2019re leaving."},{"author":"","text":"I mean, Mariah Blake interviewed hundreds of people in this small town and discussed their personal medical histories ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"And how they have been affected by this in their community\u2014the air they breathe, the water coming out of their sink fountain has been changed by these chemicals, and it is not safe for their children and for their selves."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And they\u2019re chemicals that are pretty ubiquitous, right? Like, they found them in the past, for example, in, like, disposable food containers. They\u2019re often in the material that we use to make, like, jackets waterproof. They linger in the environment for so long that, by the perspective of human lifespans, they linger forever."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean people have heard about, like, microplastics, and they\u2019re concerned about where we\u2019re finding those ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"But everyone needs to be looking into PFAS and forever chemicals a bit more than they are. These are really, really scary things that have really, really long consequences, as you\u2019re saying. And Mariah Blake does a really incredible job of bringing that all on the page. And like we were saying it\u2019s not bumming you out; it\u2019s not leaving you destitute and terrified. It\u2019s leaving you with work to do that you are excited and hopeful to be a part of."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I actually haven\u2019t read it. You make me wanna seek it out and to really, like, plow through it."},{"author":"","text":"But those books are very much on the nonfiction side. You also looked at fiction."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean, it was really fun this year to have an excuse to read some alien stories ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Kane","text":"And some fantasy stories, some romance novels. Like, you know, we are a bunch of science journalists and science nerds, but we still read romance books before we go to bed, and we wanna read short stories that keep us up at night, and they\u2019re scary. So one book that really got my attention this year is Daniel H. Wilson\u2019s Hole in the Sky ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"It\u2019s a \u201cfirst-contact\u201d alien story, which you can\u2019t see my air quotes there, but it kind of plays with this idea of first contact because the aliens land on a Cherokee reservation in Oklahoma. And the Native people\u2019s relationship to what we would refer to as \u201cfirst contact\u201d is very different than the Western understanding of that term and science fiction as a genre\u2019s general use of that term."},{"author":"","text":"And Daniel is a brilliant thriller writer who can terrify you but hold your hand through this story so that you learn from different perspectives and to have a different understanding of a genre that maybe you\u2019re very well familiar with and you\u2019ve read all the classics, or maybe you\u2019re still just dipping your toe in."},{"author":"","text":"Daniel Wilson\u2019s definitely one that caught my attention this year, and my conversation with him earlier this year was exceptional."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And it feels like, very often, when we encounter first-contact stories they are often kind of through a very white, male, Western lens, and it seems like he\u2019s playing with that a little bit."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean, the heart of the story, really, is a father-daughter relationship: Jim and Tawny. And Jim was raised a bit more traditional in the Native community, and Tawny wasn\u2019t. And they have a bit of an estranged, traumatic experience that created some distance between them\u2014I don\u2019t wanna spoil it too much for you, Kendra ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Please don\u2019t. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Kane","text":"But it\u2019s really, really beautiful, and it really made me think about Scientific American and science fiction, generally, [their] relationship to what we would refer to as \u201cfirst contact\u201d ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"And what is that \u201cfirst\u201d that we are referring to and who exactly is contacting who. I think the specificity of our language is really important, and novels like Hole in the Sky are a novel that can remind you of these really intellectually rigorous topics. And I think that\u2019s exactly the kind of stuff that we like to read around here."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And I know that\u2019s not kind of, like, the only standout within the fiction category."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, I mean, we, along with everyone else, have been obsessed with Atmosphere from Taylor Jenkins Reid this year\u2014lesbians falling in love in NASA?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Kane","text":"Sign me up, sign me up again and again."},{"author":"","text":"Former space reporter and current senior news editor here at SciAm, Sarah Lewin Frasier, reviewed it for us. And again, if a former space reporter thinks that your fictional version of NASA is real, relatable and interesting to be in, that is a very high bar to reach around here. And Atmosphere really exceeded our expectations."},{"author":"","text":"I mean, I\u2019ve been joking with Clara Moskowitz, our chief of reporters, who was also a space and physics editor here, about sobbing your eyes out at the end of this book in the best way possible, which all romance novels really should be doing. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] And it\u2019s fun to think about space romance. I feel like that\u2019s not a genre that gets as much shine."},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, people in NASA fall in love, too. Astronauts kiss [Laughs], and, like, they want to have adventures that are not just taking place on Mars or on the moon. They want to fall in love, and they want to live extraordinary lives here on Earth ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kane","text":"And I want to read every single story about that. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can you let our listeners know where they can check out the full [lists]?"},{"author":"Kane","text":"Yeah, you can find all three of our lists\u2014our staff favorites, best fiction and best nonfiction of the year\u2014online later this week."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Thank you so much for coming today, and I can\u2019t wait to check out the full lists."},{"author":"Kane","text":"I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see these lists and to see what you read this year, too, Kendra."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And don\u2019t forget to listen on Friday for our episode that looks at innovations in treating postpartum depression."},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Kendra Pierre-Louis, along with Fonda Mwangi and Jeff DelViscio.
