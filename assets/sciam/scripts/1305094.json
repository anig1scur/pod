I\u2019m Andrea Thompson, SciAm\u2019s editor for earth and environment. Today, we\u2019re talking fire and smoke. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the wildfire smoke blanketing the eastern U.S. right now.\u00a0 And even if you\u2019re not living downwind at the moment, we\u2019ve got a lot of news you can use on smoke, air quality, and how to protect your health."},{"author":"Andrea Thompson","text":"I\u2019ve pulled together a bunch of local experts\u2013my very smart Scientific American colleagues.\u00a0 #SmokeNerds By the way, we\u2019ve got our expert recommendations for sites and apps you should use to check the air quality and whether wildfire smoke is in your forecast. So make sure to listen all the way to the end. Meghan Bartels is a news reporter here. Lauren Young is associate health editor. Tanya Lewis is our senior health editor for news. Hey all."},{"author":"Meghan Bartels","text":"Hiya."},{"author":"Lauren Young","text":"Hi."},{"author":"Tanya Lewis","text":"Hey."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"So where should we start? I think the obvious place to start is, \u2018Where the smoke is coming from?\u2019 I\u2019ll take this one. This smoke is coming from Canada, in particular for the current event, mainly wildfires in Quebec. But Canada has had a terrible wildfire season across the whole country. There have been more than 400 fires so far this year and they have burned more than 9 million acres."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Fires have also been bad out west in Alberta and British Columbia, and smoke from those fires swept down over Montana and Colorado in May, causing really poor air quality. All of these fires are happening because Canada has seen stubborn hot, dry weather, including record high temperatures in May.\u00a0 So when there is a spark \u2013 for example in the form of lightning from thunderstorms, fires can really take off. So we know where it\u2019s coming from, but how long we can expect it to last? How is the smoke moving? Meghan I know you\u2019ve been reporting on that."},{"author":"Bartels","text":"It\u2019s really difficult to predict how long the smoky conditions might last. The wildfires themselves are likely to keep burning for a while."},{"author":"Bartels","text":"A Canadian fire analyst I spoke to says he hopes conditions there might ease up a little next week to at least reduce the number of fires that are starting.\u00a0 From there, it\u2019s a matter of where the wind is blowing and how high the smoke is in the atmosphere.\u00a0 Sometimes, smoke stays high up and just creates some haze, but this week, the smoke has been hanging out close to the surface, which makes it a much bigger problem."},{"author":"Bartels","text":"Geographically, the interaction between a high-pressure system over Canada and a low-pressure system east of it have sent the smoke south.\u00a0 Over the past few days, the smoke has moved, plaguing New York on Wednesday then heading down into Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland on Thursday.\u00a0 You can check your local branch of the National Weather Service or AirNow.Gov for forecast information."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Thanks for that, Meghan. Those experiencing this event probably want to know: What\u2019s in the smoke? What should people pay attention to (AQI? PM2.5? What do these things mean?)\u00a0 Lauren, can you tell us more about that?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Sure. So when we think about air quality, we look at the Air Quality Index, which is a color-coded 500-point scale that ranks air quality in your area. And one of the primary measurements for the Index is particulate matter 2.5. The shorthand for that is PM2.5, which are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller across."},{"author":"Young","text":"You can\u2019t see these harmful particles but they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\u00a0 With smoke, and air pollution, you also have volatile organic compounds.\u00a0 That\u2019s what gives smoke its sort of acrid, distinct smell.\u00a0 These compounds are toxic and are small enough to slip past face masks.\u00a0 But the thing about a lot of wildfires these days is that they are increasingly burning residential communities - that means, on top of the plants and vegetation that burns in forest wildfire, you\u2019re burning things like paint thinners, detergents, plastics, cars and so on."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Yikes. What are the health risks and who are the most vulnerable groups?"},{"author":"Young","text":"This smoke can really impact people with preexisting conditions, so - asthma, cardiopulmonary disease, lung disease. What it does is it can worsen your condition and make it more difficult to control symptoms. I talked to Ilona Jaspers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\u00a0 She told me her patients come in sometimes needing more medication. They\u2019re wheezing, they have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children, especially those under the age of five, can have a twofold increase in asthma\u2014the smoke can not only make your asthma worse, but it can actually induce it."},{"author":"Young","text":"So upping your chances of an asthma attack. Adults older than 65 also should be careful with wildfire smoke exposure.\u00a0 Even less than a day\u2019s worth of exposure from smoke hundreds of miles away can cause an increase in heart attacks and strokes. Kari Nadeau at Harvard University told me that some research has found the increased risk of stroke goes up by 40 percent from wildfire smoke exposure. Dr."},{"author":"Young","text":"Nadeau also told me that people of color and underserved communities are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, like wildfire.\u00a0 A lot of research has shown these groups are already at high risk of health issues because of where they may live and the discrimination they face. Dr. Nadeau explained that people of color in the U.S. are more likely to live near toxic waste dumps or industries that may emit pollution. These populations already have had sensitization to other toxicants - wildfire smoke is just another variable on top of that."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"So are there health risks even for healthy people? Is there research into what continuous exposure to wildfire smoke over multiple seasons does to our lungs?Young: Yes, there absolutely are risks. No one is immune from wildfire smoke symptoms."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Even within 8 hours of being exposed to just a little bit of wildfire smoke hundreds of miles away you can start feeling the effects: common ones are itchy throat, coughing, watery eyes, your skin starts itching or becomes dry.\u00a0 Within days to weeks, people can start seeing changes in asthma, heart attack, and stroke.\u00a0 There was a paper published last year that showed that brain cancer and lung cancer increases not only in wildfire fighters, but also in communities that have been exposed for many years to wildfire smoke.\u00a0 People who are pregnant should also be careful because smoke has been linked with premature and stillbirth.\u00a0 A really important thing to note is the mental health impacts of all this: Seeing and being immersed in these dense clouds of orange-brown smoke - it\u2019s unsettling, it\u2019s stressful.\u00a0 If you start to feel anxious, reach out to others or to a counselor.\u00a0 Research has also shown that people can develop post-traumatic stress disorder after wildfire events and smoke.\u00a0 Dr."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Nadeau says that we should all be compassionate and give people agency to talk about climate-related anxiety to others."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"I think we\u2019ve all felt a little stressed the last couple of days. Tanya, can you tell us what people who aren\u2019t used to dealing with wildfire can do to protect themselves?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"First of all, limit your time outside\u2014especially strenuous activities like exercise. If you must go outside, wear a high-quality mask like an N95 or KN95. You probably still have some laying around from COVID. When you\u2019re inside, keep your windows closed. If you have an air purifier, run that on high. There are lots of options out there, ranging from about $50 to well over $300. I have a couple that I like that are $150 to $200."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"You want something with HEPA or MERV filters\u2014those are the kind used in hospitals that block really small particles like those found in wildfire smoke. And make sure it\u2019s strong enough for the size of room you\u2019re in. If commercial purifiers are too pricey, you can also build your own version. During the pandemic, some scientists came up with a design called a Corsi-Rosenthal box to protect against COVID. It\u2019s basically a box fan and 4 or 5 HEPA filters duct-taped together in a cube, and it also works for air pollution."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I built one myself last year, and it\u2019s proven pretty useful the last couple days here in New York. They can be a bit loud, but it\u2019s worth it for good air quality. If you don\u2019t have a purifier or Corsi-Rosenthal box but you have an AC, you can run that and it will provide some filtration. Just make sure it\u2019s not pulling in outside air. (Fortunately, most window units just recycle inside air). You can also plug up poorly sealed windows with wet towels or painter\u2019s tape to prevent air from leaking in."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"If you don\u2019t live somewhere where you can seal the windows and filter the air, try to go somewhere that does, like an office or library. Just remember to wear a good mask on your way there and back."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Thanks, Tanya. I have definitely been wearing a mask outside this week. So finally, something people may also be wondering is, do we think this could become a more regular issue in our rapidly changing climate? That\u2019s another question I\u2019ll take. Climate change does prime things for more and stronger wildfires because the hot, dry conditions that help fuel them are becoming more likely and more intense. But factors like forest management also come into play. This can affect how much fuel \u2013 branches, leaves and other detritus \u2013 there is to burn."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"And then where smoke from those fires goes will depend on weather conditions at the time. So the point is, the future will be hazy\u2013and possibly smoke-filled."},{"author":"Bartels","text":"Okay, last thing before we go. You\u2019ve made it this far. Here\u2019s a list of sites that we all like if you want to check your personal air quality. There\u2019s Airnow.gov, IQAir, Purple Air, and your local National Weather Service (you can get there by googling your town and \u201cNWS\u201d). We\u2019ll link to all of those in the show transcript."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Thanks again for joining us on this special wildfire episode of Science, Quickly.

The shorthand for that is PM2.5, which are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller across."]},{"begin":"255.280","end":"285.840","lines":["You can\u2019t see these harmful particles but they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\u00a0 With smoke, and air pollution, you also have volatile organic compounds.\u00a0 That\u2019s what gives smoke its sort of acrid, distinct smell.\u00a0 These compounds are toxic and are small enough to slip past face masks.\u00a0 But the thing about a lot of wildfires these days is that they are increasingly burning residential communities - that means, on top of the plants and vegetation that burns in forest wildfire, you\u2019re burning things like paint thinners, detergents, plastics, cars and so on."]},{"begin":"285.840","end":"291.880","lines":["Yikes. What are the health risks and who are the most vulnerable groups?"]},{"begin":"291.880","end":"323.720","lines":["This smoke can really impact people with preexisting conditions, so - asthma, cardiopulmonary disease, lung disease. What it does is it can worsen your condition and make it more difficult to control symptoms. I talked to Ilona Jaspers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\u00a0 She told me her patients come in sometimes needing more medication. They\u2019re wheezing, they have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Children, especially those under the age of five, can have a twofold increase in asthma\u2014the smoke can not only make your asthma worse, but it can actually induce it."]},{"begin":"323.720","end":"346.080","lines":["So upping your chances of an asthma attack. Adults older than 65 also should be careful with wildfire smoke exposure.\u00a0 Even less than a day\u2019s worth of exposure from smoke hundreds of miles away can cause an increase in heart attacks and strokes. Kari Nadeau at Harvard University told me that some research has found the increased risk of stroke goes up by 40 percent from wildfire smoke exposure. Dr."]},{"begin":"346.080","end":"375.200","lines":["Nadeau also told me that people of color and underserved communities are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, like wildfire.\u00a0 A lot of research has shown these groups are already at high risk of health issues because of where they may live and the discrimination they face. Dr. Nadeau explained that people of color in the U.S. are more likely to live near toxic waste dumps or industries that may emit pollution. These populations already have had sensitization to other toxicants - wildfire smoke is just another variable on top of that."]},{"begin":"375.200","end":"389.800","lines":["So are there health risks even for healthy people? Is there research into what continuous exposure to wildfire smoke over multiple seasons does to our lungs?Young: Yes, there absolutely are risks. No one is immune from wildfire smoke symptoms."]},{"begin":"389.800","end":"447.880","lines":["Even within 8 hours of being exposed to just a little bit of wildfire smoke hundreds of miles away you can start feeling the effects: common ones are itchy throat, coughing, watery eyes, your skin starts itching or becomes dry.\u00a0 Within days to weeks, people can start seeing changes in asthma, heart attack, and stroke.\u00a0 There was a paper published last year that showed that brain cancer and lung cancer increases not only in wildfire fighters, but also in communities that have been exposed for many years to wildfire smoke.\u00a0 People who are pregnant should also be careful because smoke has been linked with premature and stillbirth.\u00a0 A really important thing to note is the mental health impacts of all this: Seeing and being immersed in these dense clouds of orange-brown smoke - it\u2019s unsettling, it\u2019s stressful.\u00a0 If you start to feel anxious, reach out to others or to a counselor.\u00a0 Research has also shown that people can develop post-traumatic stress disorder after wildfire events and smoke.\u00a0 Dr."]},{"begin":"447.880","end":"454.640","lines":["Nadeau says that we should all be compassionate and give people agency to talk about climate-related anxiety to others."]},{"begin":"454.640","end":"464.160","lines":["I think we\u2019ve all felt a little stressed the last couple of days. Tanya, can you tell us what people who aren\u2019t used to dealing with wildfire can do to protect themselves?"]},{"begin":"464.160","end":"492.120","lines":["First of all, limit your time outside\u2014especially strenuous activities like exercise. If you must go outside, wear a high-quality mask like an N95 or KN95. You probably still have some laying around from COVID. When you\u2019re inside, keep your windows closed. If you have an air purifier, run that on high. There are lots of options out there, ranging from about $50 to well over $300. I have a couple that I like that are $150 to $200."]},{"begin":"492.120","end":"520.680","lines":["You want something with HEPA or MERV filters\u2014those are the kind used in hospitals that block really small particles like those found in wildfire smoke. And make sure it\u2019s strong enough for the size of room you\u2019re in. If commercial purifiers are too pricey, you can also build your own version. During the pandemic, some scientists came up with a design called a Corsi-Rosenthal box to protect against COVID. It\u2019s basically a box fan and 4 or 5 HEPA filters duct-taped together in a cube, and it also works for air pollution."]},{"begin":"520.680","end":"549.240","lines":["I built one myself last year, and it\u2019s proven pretty useful the last couple days here in New York. They can be a bit loud, but it\u2019s worth it for good air quality. If you don\u2019t have a purifier or Corsi-Rosenthal box but you have an AC, you can run that and it will provide some filtration. Just make sure it\u2019s not pulling in outside air. (Fortunately, most window units just recycle inside air). You can also plug up poorly sealed windows with wet towels or painter\u2019s tape to prevent air from leaking in."]},{"begin":"549.240","end":"559.920","lines":["If you don\u2019t live somewhere where you can seal the windows and filter the air, try to go somewhere that does, like an office or library. Just remember to wear a good mask on your way there and back."]},{"begin":"559.920","end":"591.440","lines":["Thanks, Tanya. I have definitely been wearing a mask outside this week. So finally, something people may also be wondering is, do we think this could become a more regular issue in our rapidly changing climate? That\u2019s another question I\u2019ll take. Climate change does prime things for more and stronger wildfires because the hot, dry conditions that help fuel them are becoming more likely and more intense. But factors like forest management also come into play. This can affect how much fuel \u2013 branches, leaves and other detritus \u2013 there is to burn."]},{"begin":"591.440","end":"606.400","lines":["And then where smoke from those fires goes will depend on weather conditions at the time.
