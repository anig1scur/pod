Right now my brain is chewing on the Muppet Show theme \u2019cause I just watched a live-stream charity event where a bunch of my favorite comedians, including some from Dropout, which longtime listeners know I\u2019m a huge fan of, did a onstage reading of The Muppet Show, so right now it\u2019s just, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s time to play the music / It\u2019s time to light the lights,\u201d over and over again.

And how can we get rid of them? To answer these questions I\u2019m joined today by Scientific American senior editor Josh Fischman, who\u2019s been taking a deep dive into the psychology of earworms."},{"author":"","text":"Hi, Josh!"},{"author":"Josh Fischman","text":"Hi, Rachel. Hey, thanks for having me here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Of course, happy to have you. So do you get earworms?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I am incredibly [laughs] prone to earworms. And I\u2019m not musical; I am a failed flute player, and believe me, you really don\u2019t wanna hear me sing. But I always seem to have this musical soundtrack in the back of my head."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Can you give me an example?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Oh, Rachel\u2014you\u2019re going to be sorry that you asked that."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: The introduction of \u201cHooked on a Feeling\u201d by Blue Swede fades in.]"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That song, of course, is the 1974 hit \u201cHooked on a Feeling\u201d by the band Blue Swede. And it seems like it\u2019s there for me once or twice every week. And once it\u2019s on it doesn\u2019t go away for days."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah, a classic earworm, for sure. And I think, regardless of folks\u2019, you know, musical history or taste, since the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, I think probably the, the number of people who have that stuck in their head on any given day has gone up exponentially [laughs]."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, I\u2014thanks for that movie and, you know, Peter\u2019s mixtape for bringing that back for me, a lot."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So one thing I\u2019m curious about is how common earworms actually are."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s a great question. It doesn\u2019t have a hard-and-fast answer, though, because there\u2019s no one giant, definitive population study. But lots of smaller ones say earworms are, in fact, really common."},{"author":"","text":"I talked about this with Kelly Jakubowski, who\u2019s a psychologist at the University of Durham in England, and she\u2019s one of the leading researchers in this area."},{"author":"Kelly Jakubowski","text":"The vast majority of times we have earworms, they\u2019re songs that we, you know, we remember well, that we\u2019ve learned and have known before, and so on, and so earworms are a really interesting way to kind of provide sort of everyday insight into the workings of musical memory and how our memories sometimes, often kind of spontaneously, present us with these tunes and why they come to mind and what does it all mean."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Now, Kelly says these sneaky little critters may be windows\u2014or tiny microphones\u2014into how memory works."},{"author":"","text":"A lot of memory\u2019s voluntary, right? You try and remember where you parked your car or what you need from the grocery store. But earworms are involuntary; in fact, psychologists call them involuntary musical imagery. So looking at them may produce some insights into how memory works in a small way: where associations trigger memories or how mood is associated with memory."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019m really curious about those triggers. You know, why, for instance, does the \u201cOoga-Chaka\u201d song keep [laughs] coming back to you?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s a great question, too [laughs]. I really don\u2019t know for sure. But there are a couple of aspects of that tune that do make it prime earworm material, psychologists have found. One is the tempo and that \u201cOoga-Chaka\u201d repetition, and I\u2019ll get back to that later."},{"author":"","text":"The other might be word association. The next line after the Ooga-Chakas is: \u201cI can\u2019t stop this feeling.\u201d Now, I report on health, including psychology, so usually the word \u201cfeeling\u201d comes up every day in what I read and what I talk about. So it turns out that, according to one recent study, that associations like that are a big earworm trigger."},{"author":"","text":"I talked to another earworm researcher about the way that that works."},{"author":"Matt Evans","text":"I\u2019m Matt Evans. I\u2019m a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in cognitive psychology."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Matt told me that some psychologists figured out a cool way of developing a database of popular earworms."},{"author":"Evans","text":"Victoria Williamson and a large team of researchers out of Goldsmiths, University of London, had a, a really clever way of finding a really big dataset of people reporting their earworms and where they came from. They realized that there was a BBC radio drive-time show where the DJ would ask people to call in when they had an earworm and tell \u2019em what their earworm was and why they had it, and then they, the DJ, would play the song."},{"author":"","text":"They were able to use that to generate this sort of theoretical model of where earworms come from, and one of the most common triggers is having heard a song recently, but then various types of thematic association was also, like, a major\u2014you know, someone sees a license plate, and there\u2019s a set of letters in there that sort of looks like the word \u201cpurple,\u201d and it\u2019s raining, and that makes them think of \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d and suddenly they have Prince stuck in their head."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cPurple Rain\u201d by Prince]"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So maybe that jibes with my experience. Actually, I mentioned the \u201cOoga-Chakas\u201d song to Matt, and he said ..."},{"author":"Evans","text":"That\u2019s gonna be stuck in my head now."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I have to admit that when I looked at your outline to get ready for this episode and I saw that you were gonna mention that song, I was like, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m cooked [laughs]; it\u2019s gonna be \u2018Ookga-Chaka\u2019 all day for me [laughs].\u201d"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Oh, sorry!"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I mean, you know, who among us could possibly stop that feeling?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m high on believing that, Rachel."},{"author":"","text":"Matt went on to say that that\u2019s not the only kind of trigger."},{"author":"Evans","text":"Being in a certain mood could be a trigger for a certain earworm. A person would report that they were feeling sad, for example, and that feeling of sadness they associated with a certain song, and that song got stuck in their head."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Okay, so just a pause to do a tally of triggers here. So far we have three: There\u2019s having heard a song recently, which, of course, makes sense. Then there\u2019s also an association with something nonmusical you see or hear. And then there\u2019s your mood, like sadness or happiness. Are there any more triggers we know about?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Well, some surveys have asked people what they were doing when an earworm turned up. One of the most common answers is: \u201cNothing much.\u201d And Nick Davidenko, a psychologist at UC Santa Cruz who studies perception and memory\u2014and who works with Matt\u2014talked with me about this."},{"author":"Nick Davidenko","text":"Mind wandering or, like, taking a walk or\u2014there\u2019s a certain kind of daily things that seem to maybe not involve too much cognitive load or too much thought or effort where earworms are more likely to sort of come up or maybe more likely to be noticed."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So what Nick means by cognitive load is what you and I might call focus, Rachel. So if you\u2019re concentrating hard on something\u2014I don\u2019t know, for me, that might be rewiring an electrical outlet on my house, which makes me nervous; that\u2019s almost literally a load on my mind. It takes a lot of ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Mental resources. That\u2019s a situation where I don\u2019t hear music in my head."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"See, I\u2019m the kind of freak who hears, like, \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d when I\u2019m doing something stressful. Just [imitates the beginning of \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d by Europe]."},{"author":"","text":"But I do get what you mean [laughs] \u2019cause when I really need to knuckle down and focus on something, I actually tend to put on really repetitive instrumental music, specifically to keep my internal radio from turning on and distracting me, so it makes sense that the opposite situation\u2014where you\u2019re kind of just mentally meandering or ruminating on something\u2014is, like, prime time for earworms. You know, our minds are free to latch on to things, including songs we\u2019ve maybe heard throughout the day."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, exactly, and it\u2019s not just outside influences\u2014Kelly points out that certain musical features of the song itself can make it particularly earworm-worthy."},{"author":"Jakubowski","text":"I worked on a study that we published a few years ago, back in 2017, where we looked at the features specifically of pop songs that get stuck in people\u2019s heads. And we found that songs that are at a certain tempo range are sort of more likely to get stuck with people."},{"author":"","text":"Basically, we looked at pop songs that were really frequently named as earworms in a big survey compared to comparable pop songs that had never been named as earworms even once in this big survey. We found that earworm songs tended to be faster in tempo than the non-earworm songs. These tended to be around sort of 124 beats per minute as a sort of average tempo; obviously there was some range around that."},{"author":"","text":"Something interesting about that tempo range is that it kind of aligns quite well with what we call the sort of spontaneous preferred tempo for humans."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Basically, Kelly says, that\u2019s the speed that we kind of like to move at or to dance at."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s cool. Listeners, if you don\u2019t have a great reference point for BPMs, that\u2019s about two beats per second, which is, like, pretty snappy."},{"author":"Jakubowski","text":"Music that is at that speed seems to get stuck in our heads more often. It seems like there is this kind of inherent link between our sort of body rhythms and the rhythms of the music in our head and so on."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Now, remember, she said around 124 beats, so there\u2019s a lot of variation, but the big takeaway, just like you said, was that up-tempo songs get named as earworms by more people, like this one."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cBad Romance\u201d by Lady Gaga]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s Lady Gaga, of course, with \u201cBad Romance,\u201d a frequent earworm resident [laughs] for me."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, and it was a huge hit, too. And she\u2019s very close to 124 beats per minute there. But her chorus also shows another very earwormy feature: the melody of it rises and falls in a regular pattern\u2014it goes up, and it goes down. Kelly says that regularity may help us recall the song more easily."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Totally, yeah, I mean that little hook with the \u201cooh la las\u201d and whatever\u2014there\u2019s a lot of stuff in that song that seems really primed to get stuck in at least my head."},{"author":"","text":"So what do I do if that song is in my brain for the next three days and, as much as I love Lady Gaga, I want it gone?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, totally hear you. So earworm control is such an interesting area. Actually, all the scientists I spoke with pointed out that in surveys, most people say they like their earworms; only about a third say they\u2019re bothered by them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Okay, so why do we tend to talk about them in such a negative light? I mean, you rarely hear someone say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got this cool song in my head today, and that\u2019s so great.\u201d"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, like, I\u2019m much more likely to say, \u201cI can\u2019t get this stupid song to stop.\u201d Psychologists say that that\u2019s probably a type of cognitive bias."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"We\u2019re more likely to pay attention to negative experiences, things that irritate us, so we react to the bad earworms and the good ones happily play in the background, giving us a bit of joy when we stop and notice them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I, I buy that. But if I do have a bad one, what can I do about it?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I went back to Nick Davidenko for that one. Nick has a interesting perspective on this because he always has an earworm."},{"author":"Davidenko","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s true. As far as I can remember, even as, as a kid, I rarely experience moment of where there is no music in my head, unless I\u2019m actively talking, for example."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s a little bit random: it can be popular music, less often classical music but jazz, kind of genre of music that I listen to or that I like or that I play is a candidate\u2014or even music I don\u2019t like or, you know, theme song from a TV show or a commercial."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow. I\u2019m not quite at that level, but I do hear music in my head more often than not, and I\u2019ve honestly never stopped to think about how normal that is, and it\u2019s usually benign or even enjoyable, but there are definitely times when it gets annoying. So what does Nick do to make it stop?"},{"author":"Davidenko","text":"At some point try to jump on to another song. So it could be a related song, harmonically or melodically, or it could be a completely different song, but it helps to be another song that can get stuck in my head."},{"author":"","text":"So it, it\u2019s a trade-off, right? If you\u2019re finding yourself kind of tired of having a specific song, I have to trade it for another song, so I might as well trade it for something that\u2019s gonna be different enough and, and sort of strike a different part of my brain than whatever song that was."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And Kelly endorsed that idea."},{"author":"Jakubowski","text":"Like, switch your mental radio\u2014so imagine a song that you really do like or listen to some other music. It\u2019s very, very hard to listen to music and have a song stuck in your head at the same time; those two things use very similar neural resources in our brain, so imagining music essentially uses very similar capacities to hearing music, so it\u2019s pretty effective to block out an earworm."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"There\u2019s one final strategy sussed out by some scientists at the University of Reading in England: chew gum."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Really?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I had to get Kelly to explain that one to me. But apparently this works. It has to do with something called subvocalization."},{"author":"","text":"Essentially, when we think of lyrics or spoken words we subconsciously rehearse saying them\u2014not to the point of moving our jaws but before that\u2014kind of rehearsing the nerve signals that will move your jaws and your throat in the desired pattern. But chewing also involves those nerve signals, and they interfere with the word-rehearsal signals."},{"author":"","text":"Here\u2019s Kelly."},{"author":"Jakubowski","text":"Chewing gum actually ties up what we call the sort of articulatory-motor planning system. So in order to mentally rehearse words or songs, we need to actually, essentially, sort of mentally sing them. So if you\u2019re using your mouth, you can\u2019t actually kind of fully mentally sing them."},{"author":"","text":"So what they found is that when people chewed gum vigorously, they had fewer earworms of a song that they had heard earlier in the experiment. I think the \u201cvigorously\u201d thing is key; I suppose if you kind of start chewing the gum to the beat of the music, that might not really help [laughs]."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So, Rachel, I guess you can\u2019t play an earworm and chew gum at the same time."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Honestly, that sounds like a challenge to me, but I\u2019ll have to give it a try the next time I find myself stuck with an earworm that I, like, really can\u2019t shake\u2014something really annoying, you know? If only we had an example of something like that ..."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Listener Jesse sings \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thanks to listener Jesse from Florida for that lovely rendition of, of course, \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d And, Josh, thanks for coming by and planting all of these melodies in our heads."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Hey, Rachel, I\u2019m digging out the worms right along with you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] That\u2019s all for today's episode.
