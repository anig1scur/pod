We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research and help you understand what it really means."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And we\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors.\u00a0Today,\u00a0 we\u2019ll talk about how vaccines boost immunity even if you\u2019ve already been infected\u2026"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"... and how to handle going back to the office, even though COVID is still around. ---"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Many unvaccinated people believe that if you got COVID once, you\u2019re totally protected against getting it again. But that\u2019s not true. Can you explain?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"You\u2019re talking about the idea of natural immunity, that an early infection prevents another one. It turns out that isn\u2019t the best protection you can get. What seems to be better is something that scientists are calling \u201chybrid immunity.\u201d That\u2019s a natural infection plus a full course of vaccines. Three recent studies support this idea. Now, a previous infection does help. A paper just published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases looked at people in Sweden who were infected once."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"They had a lower risk of another infection, when compared with folks who hadn\u2019t ever been infected or folks who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Add vaccination on top of that early infection, and it improved protection by 50 percent. It also kept that protection going strong for another six months. That dovetails with a long-term study in England, which tracked people for more than a year. It appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Early infection did prevent 80 percent of second infections that would otherwise be expected. That\u2019s pretty good."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But adding vaccines improved that protection more, to nearly 100 percent.\u00a0 Finally, a study in Brazil found that people who\u2019d been infected, and then got 2 doses of vaccines, avoided 65 percent of the new infections that you\u2019d normally expect, and 80 percent of severe COVID cases. So infection alone does something, but adding vaccines does a lot more. All this brings up the issue of Omicron. I wonder, Tanya, if an infection with the original Omicron, BA.1, prevents you from getting\u00a0 BA.2, the sub-variant that\u2019s circulating now?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s a great question. In a recent story, SciAm contributor Charlie Schmidt reports that early studies suggest reinfection with BA.2 after BA.1 is possible, but rare. \u201cIf you were infected with BA.1, then you\u2019re probably well protected from BA.2,\u201d Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds School of Medicine in England, told Charlie. But that protection may not be complete, Griffin said. Countries that had big BA.1 peaks, like South Africa, haven\u2019t seen a big BA.2 peak so far. Then again, the U.K."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"had a big BA.1 surge, and still saw a notable peak in BA.2 infections several months later. But that could be more to do with the fact that it dropped all COVID restrictions, so people who had avoided getting infected in the previous wave might\u2019ve gotten sick later. We\u2019re already seeing an uptick in infections in parts of the U.S., especially in the Northeast. Whether that will lead to another surge or just a small bump remains to be seen. The good news is, many people will have some immunity from infection, vaccination, or both. ---"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So our company just announced it\u2019s reopening the office. Everyone\u2019s expected to show up. And with COVID still around, I\u2019m not super-comfortable with crowds. Are you?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Not especially. I\u2019ve been pretty careful throughout the pandemic, avoiding most indoor places except for essential ones like the grocery store, and wearing an N95 or KN95 mask whenever I\u2019m indoors. So the idea of going back to the office regularly, especially without a mask mandate, has me a little nervous."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Aren\u2019t you vaccinated and boosted, though?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m not super concerned about getting very sick myself. But I do worry about spreading the virus to others who are more vulnerable. I actually have an immunocompromised family member I visit from time to time. Plus there\u2019s the risk of long COVID. But I\u2019m probably going to go into the office a couple days a week and just wear my N95. What about you?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, I\u2019m with you on the masks. People who work retail, in grocery stores and restaurants, wear them because they deal with a stream of different people all day. So I\u2019ll do that too. I also want to keep an eye on community spread. The CDC has a tracker for this, called \u201cCOVID-19 Community Levels.\u201d You can Google it. It looks at both new cases and hospitalizations by country, and uses those to describe areas as low, medium, or high spread."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So, how do you plan to use that info?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"If my area goes into medium or high, I\u2019m going to use a mask even more often. But it's just weird, to look at stats showing that cases are starting to rise and then hop on a crowded train to go to a crowded office. Isn\u2019t it?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yes, it is unnerving. Even though MY risk of getting severely ill with COVID is fairly low, that doesn\u2019t mean I want to get it if I can help it, especially given we may be entering another surge. But does the CDC tracker miss some important info, Josh?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"True. That tracker is also too wishy-washy about when to wear a mask in \u201cmedium\u201d risk areas."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right. And according to the CDC, Manhattan is already considered medium risk. For now, I\u2019ll keep using my toolbox of precautions. In addition to wearing a good mask, I\u2019ll continue to keep my distance from people on the train when possible, and avoid crowded areas of the office."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"What do you think of our place? Does it have good airflow?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Our office doesn\u2019t have windows you can open, but it does have a decent MERV filtration system. But even with these precautions, there\u2019s still some risk, and you can\u2019t help but feel a little anxious, right?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Anxiety is OK. I mean, this virus has killed 1 million Americans in two years. Now we seem to be in a world filled with spikes and dips. We do know a lot more about how to keep ourselves safer today. If we all act on that knowledge\u2013like doing some of the things you\u2019re doing\u2013maybe I and a lot of other people might start to feel kind of comfortable. ---"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Now you\u2019re up to speed.
