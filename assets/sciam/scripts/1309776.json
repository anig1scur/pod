But creating something that works as well as our original equipment remains an enormous challenge."},{"author":"","text":"Here to walk us through the struggle to replace human heads, shoulders, knees and toes is science writer Mary Roach, author of the new book Replaceable You: Adventures in Human Anatomy."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Mary Roach","text":"Oh, thank you, Rachel, for having me on."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So your books have explored everything from the human gut to the hunt for ghosts, scientifically speaking. What is your latest about?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"Replaceable You is a look at efforts to swap out, build, replace bits and pieces of the human body. Some of the book is historical and much of it is set in the present, so it\u2019s just about the amazing challenges, and also the progress, but the\u2014just how complicated it is to try to create something that functions as well as what we start out with."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And what got you interested in that topic?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"I got an email from a woman who said, \u201cI think your next book should be about pro football referees,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s a really odd choice for me, and I don\u2019t watch football.\u201d But we started corresponding a bit, and she mentioned that she\u2019s an amputee, specifically an elective amputee, meaning she had an underperforming foot, and she had multiple surgeries and still wasn\u2019t able to really walk on it in a way that she felt she wanted to be able to do, and she used to see people walking around with prosthetics, running, hiking, and she\u2019s like, \u201cI want that. Why won\u2019t somebody cut off my foot [laughs]? Somebody please cut off my foot.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"That got me thinking about replacement parts, and so that was the spark. Then I meandered down the road through another few possible chapters I might cover, and I thought, \u201cOkay, this is the human body\u2014that\u2019s kind of my turf.\u201d I like to explore our bodies, the strange and wonderful, complicated machines that they are."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I would say that\u2019s a pretty good inspiration story [laughs]. But ..."},{"author":"Roach","text":"Odd, though. She\u2019s still after me to write a book about [laughs]\u2014she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, now you can start on that book about professional football referees [laughs].\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.] Maybe later."},{"author":"Roach","text":"Yeah, maybe next time, heh."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What did you learn about this field? How has it changed in recent years, and what kinds of things are possible right now?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"Oh, gosh. Well, that\u2019s a 200-page question [laughs]. I guess I would say that the whole field is both moving very quickly and, at the same time, amazingly slow. You know you look at something like a hip replacement: the first one was done in 1938, and there\u2019s been this progression of changes and advancements and improvements, and it\u2019s become something effective and safe and commonly done, but it was a long road."},{"author":"","text":"And, you know, and you look at stuff that\u2019s going on now in regenerative medicine and CRISPR, what was that\u2014like 2012? I mean, already we\u2019re seeing treatments coming out of that. And so things are happening at a breakneck speed, but still, you know, it\u2019s\u2014you have the discovery. You work things out. You go to clinical trials. That\u2019s 10 years, probably, before something is ready to be released, and then you have to convince the insurance companies. Anyway, so it\u2019s a strange mix of things happening at a really amazing pace, but also, it\u2019s just a long haul, always."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And could you give our listeners some examples of the kinds of parts we\u2019re talking about replacing? Just a couple of your favorites, since, like you said, that is a 200-page question [laughs]."},{"author":"Roach","text":"[Laughs.] Yeah, yeah. I started out with, with noses \u2019cause I\u2014you know, the nose was the first thing that was widely replaced, partly because nasal mutilation was a, going back hundreds of years, a punishment. So it was both a punishment and a deterrent to hack someone\u2019s nose off because everybody can see it. So there was this need for rebuilding noses. Even going back to 1,000 B.C. there were people who had the idea that you could take a little piece of the forehead or the cheek and you could cut it out, kind of flop it over onto the nose, leave it attached and rebuild a nose that way, which is astounding."},{"author":"","text":"So that was, that was where it began, and now we\u2019re talking about trying to grow things from scratch. I thought, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have a background in this, let\u2019s start with something simple.\u201d And there was a company, Stemson Therapeutics, that was attempting to grow follicles using induced pluripotent stem cells. And it was both like, \u201cWow, look what they\u2019re doing,\u201d and also, \u201cThat\u2019s all you got?\u201d [Laughs.]"},{"author":"","text":"So they would take, like, off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cells; they\u2019d figured out a way to teach them to become the two kind of building blocks of a follicle. And they had these two types of cells, dermal papillae cells and keratinocytes, and the cells would kind of come together and create a primitive follicle\u2014like, more than a blob, less than a follicle. It was producing hair, right? It was producing hairlike\u2014hair material, but it was underneath the skin; it wasn\u2019t coming up."},{"author":"","text":"So they\u2019re like\u2014they called it \u201cdisorganized hair.\u201d And they\u2019re looking\u2014they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get it to come out of the skin. It\u2019s gotta\u2014\u201d Wherever they put it, it would heal over, like skin does, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cWe need a little tube.\u201d And so they got these amazing engineers to create little, tiny tubes for the hair material to grow up and out of the skin, but the tubes, it turned out, they were too delicate to implant, and how are they gonna get to implant a follicle? It requires a little force to get it in there. And so that wasn\u2019t gonna work."},{"author":"","text":"And then they were threading the two types of cells on a piece of kind of thread and letting them come together, and then at some point they\u2019d pull the thread out. And it was incredibly complicated, and it was working and exciting\u2014and then they didn\u2019t get enough funding, and they went out of business [laughs]. So that\u2019s kind of the story."},{"author":"","text":"Nobody\u2019s growing organs from stem cells, whole organs; that\u2019s still science fiction. But creating just, like, little clusters and patches and\u2014of cells that are, maybe, you have folks looking at treatments for diabetes and, potentially, for Parkinson\u2019s where you could, you could, in a bespoke way, take somebody\u2019s cells, regress them to pluripotency and then turn them into the kind of neuronal cells that produce dopamine or turn them into islet cells that produce insulin. So you have this \u201cprimitive,\u201d in quotes, but pretty exciting stuff."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. What excites you the most about the future of some of the research you covered in the book?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"I\u2019m gonna\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t get into how AI is used in all of these things, but my sense is that\u2019s gonna really speed up this work. That\u2019s gonna make it quicker to find molecules that work, quicker\u2014just everything may be speeded up. And, and that makes me sad that\u2014the kind of cuts that are going on to basic research, that\u2019s been really sad. The book was about to go to production when [the U.S. DOGE Service] kicked in, so, you know, I had to call all the labs and kind of say, \u201cAre you still okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"But that\u2019s not what you\u2014you asked me what\u2019s exciting, not what\u2019s depressing [laughs]. Oh, it\u2019s all, \u201cWe\u2019re just in this period of massive potential.\u201d And then you dive in, and you look at the challenges\u2014it\u2019s just very, very difficult to do something as well as the body does it. But things are moving fast."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Your books always take you to such interesting locations. Were there any labs or other places in particular that really stuck out to you?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"I spent time in a designated pathogen-free pigsty in China where pigs are being raised for xenotransplantation of organs. Just the idea of a highly clean [laughs]\u2014\u201csuperclean\u201d is the technical term\u2014a superclean pigsty was kind of appealing, so I visited. I wasn\u2019t allowed in. I went all the way to China, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, over the hill there, that\u2019s where they, that\u2019s where they are. So how are we getting there? We\u2019re gonna\u2014\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not going in.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cYou\u2019re a massive pile of bact\u2014"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"\u201cYou\u2019re too dirty\u201d [laughs]."},{"author":"Roach","text":"\u201cYou\u2019re a filthy human. You don\u2019t come anywhere near our pigs.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"That was fascinating. I got to see them in the control center; they have videos on all of the pigs. And so I got to, I got to see them but not say hello in person. But it\u2019s kind of an amazing\u2014I mean, they had a bunkhouse where the workers stay for three months; they\u2019re quarantined. And then they stay there\u2014they can\u2019t leave. It\u2019s just them and the pigs. The pigs are tested for 40 different bacteria and viruses and fungi. Everything is disinfected every three days. The food gets irradiated. I mean, it\u2019s an amazing operation. And then you look on the screen, and, like, there\u2019s a pig taking a crap, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s just a pigsty.\u201d It\u2019s a\u2014I mean, you can\u2019t train a pig to use a toilet, so."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Roach","text":"[Laughs.] Presumably that pig s\u2014 was really sterile and clean."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s great. Thank you so much for coming on to talk about the book. Would you remind folks what it\u2019s called?"},{"author":"Roach","text":"Sure, it\u2019s called Replaceable You, and the subtitle is Adventures in Human Anatomy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

You know you look at something like a hip replacement: the first one was done in 1938, and there\u2019s been this progression of changes and advancements and improvements, and it\u2019s become something effective and safe and commonly done, but it was a long road."]},{"begin":"220.320","end":"252.320","lines":["And, you know, and you look at stuff that\u2019s going on now in regenerative medicine and CRISPR, what was that\u2014like 2012?

You go to clinical trials. That\u2019s 10 years, probably, before something is ready to be released, and then you have to convince the insurance companies.

I started out with, with noses \u2019cause I\u2014you know, the nose was the first thing that was widely replaced, partly because nasal mutilation was a, going back hundreds of years, a punishment. So it was both a punishment and a deterrent to hack someone\u2019s nose off because everybody can see it. So there was this need for rebuilding noses. Even going back to 1,000 B.C. there were people who had the idea that you could take a little piece of the forehead or the cheek and you could cut it out, kind of flop it over onto the nose, leave it attached and rebuild a nose that way, which is astounding."]},{"begin":"300.440","end":"322.240","lines":["So that was, that was where it began, and now we\u2019re talking about trying to grow things from scratch. I thought, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have a background in this, let\u2019s start with something simple.\u201d And there was a company, Stemson Therapeutics, that was attempting to grow follicles using induced pluripotent stem cells.

And they had these two types of cells, dermal papillae cells and keratinocytes, and the cells would kind of come together and create a primitive follicle\u2014like, more than a blob, less than a follicle. It was producing hair, right? It was producing hairlike\u2014hair material, but it was underneath the skin; it wasn\u2019t coming up."]},{"begin":"350.320","end":"378.080","lines":["So they\u2019re like\u2014they called it \u201cdisorganized hair.\u201d And they\u2019re looking\u2014they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get it to come out of the skin. It\u2019s gotta\u2014\u201d Wherever they put it, it would heal over, like skin does, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cWe need a little tube.\u201d And so they got these amazing engineers to create little, tiny tubes for the hair material to grow up and out of the skin, but the tubes, it turned out, they were too delicate to implant, and how are they gonna get to implant a follicle? It requires a little force to get it in there. And so that wasn\u2019t gonna work."]},{"begin":"378.080","end":"394.960","lines":["And then they were threading the two types of cells on a piece of kind of thread and letting them come together, and then at some point they\u2019d pull the thread out.
