    "John O\u2019Keefe shared the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience in 2014 for discovering that neurons in the hippocampus encode an animal\u2019s location and create a cognitive map for navigation.This podcast was produced for the Kavli Prize by Scientific American Custom Media, a division separate from the magazine\u2019s board of editors."

      "text": "When you release a carrier pigeon into the air, how does it know its way home? How do we navigate city streets without getting lost? John O\u2019Keefe has found the very cells in the brain that help animals and humans know where they are in space. In 2014, he shared The Kavli Prize in Neuroscience with Brenda Milner and Marcus Raichle for their work uncovering the special networks in our brains that \u200b\u200bdeal with memory and learning. That same year, he also won the Nobel Prize. Scientific American Custom Media, in partnership with The Kavli Prize, spoke with John about his research and the future of the field. --------"

If we got the animal to go to another part of the box, for the same reasons, the cells started to fire. So it wasn\u2019t because he was going for water, or food \u2014 it was where he was going."

      "author": "O\u2019Keefe: ",
      "text": "The idea, then, is to try to come up with very sensitive spatial navigation and spatial memory tests, which will actually enable us to test large numbers of people very early on. And we\u2019re hoping to be able to do this when they\u2019re, say, 30 years old."

He\u2019s working on designing those tests now. In the meantime, should we be doing specific things to avoid dementia? Like driving taxicabs or turning off our GPS?"

There aren\u2019t a lot of people to talk to. So, pick a topic you love, so you can withstand the bumps along the way."
