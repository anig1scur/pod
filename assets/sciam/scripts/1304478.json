It\u2019s a response that\u2019s especially strong in species in which the young are physically immature and unable to care for themselves. Now, when a mama mouse picks up and runs off with a pup, it\u2019s generally not so she can get some shut-eye."},{"author":"Kuroda","text":"It is often an emergency that forces animal parents to carry their infants ..."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"To, say, avoid an encroaching predator."},{"author":"Kuroda","text":"So the infants innately cooperate with the parents by withholding their cries and movements during carrying ..."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Because their lives literally depend on it. Now, to test the transport response in humans, Kuroda and her colleagues had 21 moms try four different approaches to getting their fussy babies to hush. They held the babies while walking or just sitting. They pushed them in a stroller or placed them in a crib or on a couch\u2014for just five minutes."},{"author":"Kuroda","text":"And we found that all the infants stopped crying, and more than half of them fell asleep, during or soon after the five minutes of carrying\u2014even in the daytime."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That\u2019sa time when they wouldn\u2019t normally be trying to nap. Laying the babies down or sitting with them did nothing. But in the stroller\u2014which seemed to work as well as the carry-and-walk approach\u2014the babies relaxed. Their heart rate slowed, and they dropped off to sleep. Then came the tricky part."},{"author":"Kuroda","text":"When the mothers tried to put their sleepy babies to bed, more than one third of the infants became alert again."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Itturns out that detaching from mom triggers a physiological response that can wake a baby right up again.
