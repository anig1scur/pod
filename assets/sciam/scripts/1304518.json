      "text": "Raging wildfires, extreme flooding and heat waves in the winter \u2014 there's no denying that climate change is here. But what can we do about it? How do we prepare for what's coming, ease the impacts and build a resilient society? Battelle, a nonprofit organization focused on applied science and technology, is tackling this question at its Innovations In Climate Resilience conference this March. The second annual event brings together the top experts on climate change to share breakthroughs and action plans. Scientific American Custom Media recently sat down with Justin Sanchez, a technical fellow at Battelle and lead organizer of the conference, to learn more about the conference and why climate resilience is a top priority. Justin Sanchez has spent his life creating innovative technology, first for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA."

      "author": "Hall",
      "text": "Working on those problems is literally Battelle's mission. It was founded as a charitable trust nearly 100 years ago, with the goal of using science and technology to address society's biggest challenges."

      "text": "It's almost a daunting task. But, with that being said, we have a few focus areas. So, inside of Battelle, we have a focus on health, we focus on environment and infrastructure, and we also focus on national security."

    {
      "author": "Hall",

      "text": "We might be thinking today about how the increase in food prices, yeah, might be tied in a large part to, you know, inflation and other kinds of things, but those food prices are also affected by how hard it is to grow those crops, which is impacted by climate change."

      "author": "Hall",
      "text": "Even if you're not a scientist or an expert on climate change, Justin says it's worth coming to the conference for new perspectives and inspiration. In the end, it's going to take all of us \u2014 on personal and political levels \u2014 to respond to climate change and build a resilient society. Justin Sanchez is a technical fellow at Battelle. The Innovations In Climate Resilience conference runs from March 28th to the 30th in Columbus, Ohio. Registration details are at battelle.org. Battelle is an independent nonprofit charitable trust that advances science and technology to have the greatest impact on our society and economy. This podcast was produced by Scientific American Custom Media and made possible through the support of Battelle.
