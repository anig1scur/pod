For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman."},{"author":"","text":"Today, instead of our usual news roundup, I\u2019m here to introduce you to our new interim host. I\u2019m actually going on parental leave for a little bit, and I\u2019ll be gone until sometime in the spring of 2026, but the amazing, award-winning Kendra Pierre-Louis is here to fill in for me while I\u2019m gone. And today we figured we would chat about who she is and what she likes to write about so that you could get to know her."},{"author":"","text":"Kendra, welcome."},{"author":"Kendra Pierre-Louis","text":"Hey, Rachel. [Laughs.] I was gonna be like, \u201cThanks for having me.\u201d [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.] Settle in. Make yourself comfortable."},{"author":"","text":"So, Kendra, tell our listeners a little bit about who you are."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I\u2019m a climate reporter, like, mostly by training, and I\u2019ve been working in climate for a decade now, almost. I think my first job was actually with you ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yes, at Popular Science [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"At Popular Science. Woot, woot!"},{"author":"","text":"The most important thing, I think, to know about me is that I hate mayonnaise."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.] It\u2019s true that there are many accolades I could tack onto your name, but if someone had to say one thing about a journalist that would make me say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s Kendra,\u201d it would be [laughs] \u201cthe one who really hates mayonnaise.\u201d"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So [laughs], but this is\u2014listeners might be confused about why we would bring this up in the context of you hosting Science Quickly, but it is something that you\u2019ve really used to launch several really fascinating science stories. So yeah, tell us more about your history with mayo. How did this contentious relationship begin?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I think I came out of the womb as a mayo hater. I just never liked it, and it just got more aggressive with age. Like, when I was quite young\u2014I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m gonna admit this\u2014I could eat coleslaw, but only the coleslaw from KFC, which is 90 percent vinegar anyway. And then I think the turning point was: I was eight years old, and we were on a road trip back from Florida, and my mom handed me a sandwich, and I looked at her, and I said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have mayo in it, does it?\u201d and she reassured me that it did not. And I bit into it, and it had Miracle Whip, and that\u2019s when I knew you people need to be stopped [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And by \u201cyou people,\u201d I mean mayo lovers [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And, yeah, while we were working together at Popular Science you wrote a real manifesto against mayo that took you on, like, a really fascinating journey into the science of food and texture and perception. So tell us a little bit about some of what you\u2019ve learned."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, I think that story is called \u201cMayonnaise is disgusting, and science agrees,\u201d and if I recall correctly, that may be the first time that, like, a third-party entity lobbied my editor for me to take down a story [laughs], which goes to show you, yet again, the impact and the weight of Big Mayo."},{"author":"","text":"I\u2019ve learned kind of two things. I\u2019ve learned sort of more broadly, like, trying to understand\u2014because I talk about mayo the most because it comes up the most. Like, you\u2019ll order french fries or something, and that\u2019ll come out drizzled with mayo, and, like, nowhere on the menu did it mention that it had mayo in it. But I actually don\u2019t like any savory, creamy foods, so no fettuccine Alfredo. I don\u2019t like butter. Tillamook cheese company just came out with Butternaise, which is a blend of butter and mayonnaise, and I think they just created it to kill me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs.] See, as someone who loves butter and mayonnaise, I have to agree that\u2019s a bridge too far [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] And so there are kind of two buckets, which is, like, the texture of the food itself, which I\u2019ve dug into a lot, and how in the West in general\u2014like there are a lot of words in, like, Mandarin, for example, related to the texture of food, and most Western languages, and English in particular, are not that colorful with our descriptions."},{"author":"","text":"And the texture of food on its own is just, like, really fascinating. I like to toss out, like, little facts, like have you ever wondered why, like, so many sour candies tend to come with, like, a rough texture on them? And it\u2019s because we perceive foods as more sour if they\u2019re rough than if they\u2019re smooth."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s so interesting."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Ice cream, for example, if you\u2019ve ever made ice cream yourself, the batter is almost, like\u2014you look at how much sugar you put in it, and you\u2019re like, \u201cNo one could eat this.\u201d It\u2019s so much sugar, and it\u2019s because we don\u2019t perceive sweetness as well ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"When foods are very cold."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, that\u2019s interesting. I\u2014it\u2019s funny\u2014I was reading a random article, and it referenced very matter-of-factly the time such and such actor gained weight by drinking microwaved H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and I was like ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] My God. Oh, my God."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I was like, \u201cThat does sound disgusting, but fundamentally, how is it different from a milkshake?\u201d But I think, crucially [laughs], the milk that dilutes the milkshake and the fact that it\u2019s cold makes a big difference."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, and that word you just used is kind of the other bucket that I\u2019ve, like, really dug into, which is that, for people like me, there are foods that I don\u2019t like\u2014like, I don\u2019t like ketchup, for example. But, like, I don\u2019t think about ketchup. It doesn\u2019t ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"You\u2019re not disgusted by ketchup."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Ketchup doesn\u2019t haunt me. It doesn\u2019t disgust me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Whereas mayo\u2019s really physically\u2014like, it\u2019s not even\u2014I would need to go through a lot of therapy and training to get to a place where I could eat it. The smell, everything about it\u2014oh, God, like, I can\u2019t have it in my home."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"It\u2019s just, like\u2014it is contaminating to me in a way that, like, ketchup is not."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and what have you learned about disgust?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"It\u2019s innate. It\u2019s built into us. Obviously, what we express disgust towards varies a little bit, but we tend to have kind of an innate disgust towards bodily fluids and death, the smell of death: two big things that are kind of hardwired into us. So I jokingly say that the reason I don\u2019t like mayo is it reminds me of pus, which no mayo eater [laughs] ever wants to hear."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"No, no, I don\u2019t wanna hear that."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"But that face you just made when I said \u201cpus,\u201d that\u2019s, like, a hardwired ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Kind of disgust."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, and I remember a story you wrote for PopSci that got into some of the descriptors for food textures that we lack in English, which has fascinated me ever since. I would love to hear some of your favorites."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So the one that I talk about the most and the one that I love the most is the texture of boba or udon, or ramen has it. And it\u2019s, like, food that has, like, a bounce to it before it gives way ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So it\u2019s not quite chewy, \u2019cause boba isn\u2019t quite chewy\u2014like, it does kind of, like, release at a certain point. And that is, like, top 10 of my favorite textures."},{"author":"","text":"Like, the researchers actually categorize texture sort of more broadly [based on], like, the type of food. Like, there\u2019s crunchers, who prefer foods that, you know, are crunchy, so potato chips; smooshers, who like soft, creamy foods, like pudding or, I\u2019m guessing, Alfredo sauce; suckers, who prefer, like, hard candy that dissolves slowly over time; and chewers, and they prefer foods that can be chewed for a long time, like gummy candy. And I\u2019m 100 percent a chewer."},{"author":"","text":"What is\u2014like, of those four categories, chewers, crunchers, suckers, smooshers, which are you?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s a really good question. I guess if I had to pick one, I would be a chewer, but I feel like everything but [smooshers] seems on the table for me. Though I really [laughs]\u2014I definitely know people who love a mush, and I don\u2019t have a\u2014there are many mushes I enjoy; I love an oatmeal [laughs]. But yeah, I can\u2019t say that I think of that as a texture I crave [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, I think I\u2019m clearly a chewer and then cruncher, and then I tolerate being a sucker ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"But I\u2019m not a smoosher at all. When I was in college my mom bought me a giant package of, like, instant oatmeal, and, you know, I was, like, a broke college student, so I had to eat it, and the way I dealt with it was I just ate it undercooked."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] I had great cholesterol that year, but\u2014so there were pros and cons, but [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So outside of your forays into food texture what are some of your favorite topics to cover?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I love climate generally because climate touches everything, and so it\u2019s, like, this really interesting inroad into, like, the world at large. And I like the way climate brings you into contact with people. I love looking at solutions \u2019cause I feel like so much, when we\u2019re talking about climate change, it\u2019s looking at the problem, and I really enjoy looking at solutions within climate journalism."},{"author":"","text":"Right now I\u2019m also looking a little bit at, like, psychology ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"A little bit, like, what allows people to normalize really terrible things ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And what allows people to sort of not fight back or to acquiesce in sort of\u2014you know, kind of like the Stanford prison experiment ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"But not that intensely [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"More, more like in everyday scenarios, like the choice that people make to fight or to not fight."},{"author":"","text":"And also, I\u2019m kind of obsessed with fame at the moment, like, the psychology of fame, both as, you know, like, what makes us attracted to famous people? What is the power that fame holds over us? And not just, like, in terms of celebrity, but, like, we reproduce kind of fame over and over again. Like, the most popular kid at your high school was famous, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, right."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"A much lower level, obviously, but, like, it still reproduces that feeling, and what is that, and, like, why are we into it?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so you\u2019ll be at the hosting helm of Science Quickly for a few months. What stories are you most interested in pursuing while you\u2019re here?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"You\u2019ve, you know, left some pretty big shoes to temporarily fill ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Nooo [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So thank you for that [laughs]. The expectations are quite high."},{"author":"","text":"I think there\u2019s a number of things. Like, obviously, we\u2019re in a really interesting time in terms of, like, public health."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Unfor\u2014I wish, maybe, we were in less interesting times."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019d love to live in uninteresting times, frankly [laughs]."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] What are they even like?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I don\u2019t know."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I think I experienced them as a child."},{"author":"","text":"So, like, there\u2019s public health, I think. Looking at a little bit, maybe, of the science behind extremism. And then sort of a little bit of light, a little bit of levity\u2014it can\u2019t be dark all of the time. I love a good animal story."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, we have fun here. We gotta cover the horrors, but [laughs] we, we also have a good time."},{"author":"","text":"Well, Kendra, thanks so much for sitting down so our listeners could get to know you, and of course, they will be hearing you three times a week in their feed, so they\u2019re about to get to know you a lot better."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Awesome. Thanks so much for having me, and I\u2019m excited to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, that\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode, and that\u2019s it for me until 2026, so I\u2019ll toss it over to you."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Tune in on Wednesday when we talk about griefbots, or how AI is helping people deal with the loss of their loved ones."},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Kendra Pierre-Louis and Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi and Jeff DelViscio.
