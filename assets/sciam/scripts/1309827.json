But in recent years he\u2019s added fiction writer to his list of jobs, publishing thrillers based on the real history of the space race."},{"author":"","text":"His latest book, Final Orbit, is set in 1975 and features historical figures navigating geopolitical tensions that may sound surprisingly familiar to anyone following current events."},{"author":"","text":"Here to talk about how his experience as an astronaut informs his fiction writing is Colonel Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Chris Hadfield","text":"My pleasure."},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"Yeah, I served as an astronaut for 21 years and flew in space three times, commanded a spaceship, did some space walks, but all good things must come to an end, and I retired from 35 years of government service."},{"author":"","text":"Since then I\u2019ve written six books. I help lead several space companies and other tech companies. I run a big international technology incubator called the Creative Destruction Lab\u2014I run a, a big section of that. Working with King Charles [III] on space sustainability, a project called the Sustainable Markets Initiative. I tour with a band, and we played a concert that sold out in a day, so that, that was a lot of fun. And, and I have two granddaughters. But no, life is busy and full and rich, thank you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s awesome. And you actually are just releasing\u2014I believe it\u2019s your third work of fiction, which might surprise some listeners. It\u2019s been a busy few years, so they might\u2019ve missed that you were writing fiction at all. Could you tell us a little bit about how you got interested in, in that and what the process has been like for you?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"I\u2019ve always loved writing; it was my favorite subject in school. But I knew if I got a arts degree, they wouldn\u2019t let me command a spaceship [laughs], so I, I studied engineering in school. But I\u2019ve always, you know, really admired writing and enjoyed the escapism of good fiction. My first three books were nonfiction, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could write good fiction, fiction that people would wanna read. And, and they\u2019ve just done so superbly well\u2014it\u2019s the Apollo Murders series. It\u2019s in, I don\u2019t know, 15 languages or something and optioned for TV and movies."},{"author":"","text":"And I\u2019m, as you say, I\u2019m just releasing the third book in the Apollo Murders series; it\u2019s called Final Orbit. And it\u2019s alternative-history thriller fiction set in the summer of 1975 during the cold war and the end of the Apollo era with Apollo-Soyuz and a derelict space station called Skylab, and all sorts of untoward things happen in Final Orbit. It\u2019s getting just killer reviews. I\u2019m really pleased with how the book came out."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"As you said, these are works of fiction and, and they\u2019re thrillers, but obviously, there is a lot of fact woven into the story. Could we start by talking about just how your history as an astronaut has informed your fiction writing?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"I decided to be an astronaut when I was nine years old. I, I didn\u2019t hope to be an astronaut; I decided to start turning myself into an astronaut at nine. So there\u2019s been an\u2014almost an entire lifetime of research for writing a book \u2019cause, \u2019cause I\u2019d just been fascinated by it. And, and then I served 21 years as an astronaut, and you, you don\u2019t just fly in space as a professional astronaut. I was NASA\u2019s chief of operations in Russia and chief of space station operations. I worked in mission control as the lead capcom for 25 shuttle flights in a row."},{"author":"","text":"I\u2019ve been so incredibly lucky to have this depth of real-world space experience, and, and so when I\u2014now, when I\u2019m writing fiction, I do a, a huge amount of research to make sure I get all the facts right, but I also have the lucky resource of my own memories and impressions and knowledge to draw on to make these books not just an interesting plot but something that absolutely could have happened, with every little detail correct. And I think that makes for a more compelling story."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And could you tell us about some of the real historical events and figures that readers can keep an eye out for in this book?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"Yeah, in my thriller or fiction books, almost all the characters are real people. I mean, President [Richard] Nixon; Henry Kissinger; Al Shepard; Bob Crippen; Mao Zedong; a guy named Qian Xuesen, who was the, the father of Chinese spaceflight the United States foolishly deported during the McCarthy era. And it\u2019s really fun weaving through history in the \u201970s because characters come up like George Bush Sr., who, at the time of 1975, when, when Final Orbit is set, he was sort of the, the top American in China\u2014they didn\u2019t have an embassy because of conflict then but, but the, the American mission to China."},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s delightful really digging into what actually happened and the real characters, including the crews that were flying in space right then, the cosmonauts and astronauts, and then finding ways just through slightly alternative possibilities of what might have happened to"},{"author":"","text":"really create a suspenseful and credible plot. In the back of the book, Rachel, I, I put a section just for the reader so they can see what was real and what wasn\u2019t real ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"And I think, when you flick to the back and look at it, you\u2019ll be surprised just how much of that book\u2014not only the people, but what actually happened\u2014is, is word for word or, or minute by minute what really went on."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. So you\u2019ve done two things that many people say they would like to do and are very hard to accomplish, which is going to space and writing and publishing a novel. What\u2014which one do you think is harder [laughs]?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"Going to space."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, makes sense."},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"There are a million books a year published; in the entire history of humanity just a, a tiny number of humans have actually flown in space. So\u2014and, and it, it\u2019s a life\u2019s work, and the odds are terrible [laughs]; almost everybody fails the medical as well as all of the other training requirements. So\u2014and, and I, I decided to be an astronaut when I was nine; it was 26 years of work ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"Before I flew in space. So yeah, writing a novel\u2019s a lot of work. It\u2019s\u2014I, I write a book every couple years; it\u2019s a lot of work. But being a professional astronaut, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a, a life\u2019s work."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely. What are you hoping that readers take away from this book, other than, you know, being gripped and entertained, obviously?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"I think people will be surprised, in, in reading Final Orbit, just how much of what was going on then is exactly being replayed right now ..."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s this conflict between the Russians, the Soviet Union, and the United States. And China is emerging as a new technical\u2014technological force. That was going on in the early \u201970s. China had launched its first rocket. It had its first space capsule. They had selected astronauts. They were training astronauts. They built the relay ships. They, you know, they were way heavily involved, and they were really on their way to becoming one of the major world space powers."},{"author":"","text":"And when you look at the geopolitical forces going on right now, I think it\u2019s really worth reading to see: How did this happen in the past? What was going on? Why was it happening? And when you write fiction, you could really bring it to life; it\u2019s not just some sort of dry history but what were the, the forces and the individual desires? You know, people do things for selfish reasons\u2014why were we doing all those things? And then maybe it will help, as, as the news reels are ripping by today, gain a little in, insight into maybe why some of the things are happening today as well."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to, to chat about the book. Would you remind our listeners and viewers what it\u2019s called so they can go check it out?"},{"author":"Hadfield","text":"My new space thriller is called Final Orbit. It\u2019s alternative-history fiction. It\u2019s getting absolutely killer reviews. I hope you enjoy reading it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode. We\u2019ll be back on Friday. Don\u2019t forget to go vote for Science Quickly to win a Signal Award. You\u2019ve only got a day or so left to do so!
