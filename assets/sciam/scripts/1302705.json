I\u2019m Katie Hafner, and I\u2019m the host of a new podcast called Lost Women of Science. I\u2019ve been writing about science and technology for decades, most of that time for the\u00a0New York Times, but very rarely did I write about a woman who was a major figure. I don\u2019t remember it bothering me very much at the time. It just seemed normal. I believed I was writing about the most important people in their fields, but it became clear, as my career went on, that important figures were missing, namely women. I started asking why this was a couple of years ago. And I kept coming back to something called the Matilda effect, which is basically a bias against acknowledging women for their work in science. Instead\u00a0the credit goes to a man. A good example I saw in the news recently is Jocelyn Bell Burnell. She\u2019s a radio astronomer who discovered the first two pulsars, but the Nobel Prize went to a man. If we don\u2019t catch these misattributions, these women can just fade away from our consciousness, and we\u2019ll never know the truth about their story and about our history. I started this podcast to retrieve these scientists from oblivion. We put together a trailer for this series and here it is:\u00a0 [Trailer plays]"},{"author":"Hafner: ","text":"I'm Katie Hafner, host of a new podcast called Lost Women of Science.

We at Lost Women of Science go searching in archives, in museums, in hospitals, in people\u2019s basements to piece these people\u2019s lives back together after they\u2019ve been neglected for many, many decades. Our first season is about a pathologist named Dorothy Andersen, the first person to identify cystic fibrosis in a patient in the 1930s. Her work is the foundation for the treatments available for the disease today. In the Lost Women of Science podcast, we break down the science and we try to figure out who these people were and what the world around them was like then. It\u2019s like a science podcast meets a period piece meets a mystery.\u00a0 The more I do this research, the more I realized that women were at the heart of some of the most important developments in science. A couple of examples: In the early 1900s, Alice Ball, a young Black chemist came up with the most effective treatment for leprosy. And the work of Katalin Karik\u00f3, a Hungarian biochemist, has been crucial to the development of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccine.
