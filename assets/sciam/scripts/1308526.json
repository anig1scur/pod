Earlier this month net neutrality was back in the news, thanks to a U.S. appeals court ruling. The decision stated that the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, didn\u2019t have the power to reinstate net neutrality rules\u2014which the agency voted to do in April, with the encouragement of then-president Joe Biden."},{"author":"","text":"Net neutrality is one of those issues that I\u2019ve never quite fully wrapped my head around. So what is it, and what will happen now that the FCC can\u2019t enforce it? Here to explain everything for us is Ben Guarino, an associate technology editor at Scientific American.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Ben, thanks for coming on to chat."},{"author":"Ben Guarino","text":"Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"This is a question I feel like I should be able to answer by now, but I can\u2019t: What is net neutrality?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"So in the simplest terms, net neutrality is this idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. So if I am trying to access YouTube or Netflix or Hulu or really anything, my Internet service provider, my ISP, is going to treat all of those data packets coming from those websites like they\u2019d be coming from any other website"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So why are we hearing about net neutrality in the news? What\u2019s been going on with it?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"There has been a huge debate over whether net neutrality should exist in the United States. The Internet service providers, \u201cWell, if you put these regulations on us, it\u2019s going to stifle competition. It is against the American ideals of capitalism.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And then you have consumers and Internet advocates and people who cherish the idea of the open Internet that really gets to the founding ideals of what the Internet should be\u2014it should be free; it should be for the flow of information\u2014that say, \u201cWe should, we should hold ourselves to net neutrality.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so it boils down to who should be regulating it. And the courts recently decided that the Federal Communications Commission cannot treat the Internet with net neutrality principles."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Interesting. What\u2019s next? What does that mean for people who are pushing for a free and open Internet?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"So if the FCC does not have the ability to regulate ISPs like a telecommunication service\u2014that means that these services have to act in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d which has higher standards that they have to be held to\u2014if the FCC isn\u2019t the one that can enforce these net neutrality principles, then it\u2019s in Congress\u2019s hands or it\u2019s in the state\u2019s hands."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Okay, is this good news or bad news for the open Internet?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"It\u2019s bad news for the people who advocate for the open Internet. So if there\u2019s no federal oversight of net neutrality, what we have now are the state laws that support net neutrality. And these are on the books in lots of places\u2014in Washington state, in Oregon, in California\u2014and it had kinda looked like maybe they weren\u2019t really being enforced because the thinking was, \u201cWell, if there\u2019s federal oversight of net neutrality, maybe we don\u2019t have to worry about our own states.\u201d Now that equation changes a little bit."},{"author":"","text":"And the thing with the Internet is [laughs] it\u2019s all connected, right? So you can\u2019t\u2014the, the borders of the Internet don\u2019t stop in California, so if California has net neutrality laws on the books, there is some thinking there that, \u201cWell, if ISPs in California are beholden to these laws, they\u2019ll just follow them everywhere.\u201d So that could be a silver lining for folks who want to see the principles of the open Internet upheld."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And from the perspective of the ISPs, what\u2019s limiting about net neutrality? What are they trying to do, hoping to do that this sort of free and open Internet won\u2019t allow them to do?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"So the theory goes that if I can treat one data packet differently from another data packet, I could slow your traffic to Netflix. Maybe I have a competitor streaming service\u2014and I should back up a second: we talk about net neutrality a lot in terms of video streaming because it\u2019s data intensive and, like, something like two thirds of Internet traffic is video streaming, so that\u2019s why, that\u2019s why net neutrality and video services tend to go hand in hand. But if I am an Internet service provider and maybe I have a competitor website to Netflix or Hulu ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"And I want to have more people use my service, then I can slow their connection to Netflix and maybe shunt them towards my competitor. Or I can say, \u201cHey, Netflix, you guys have to pay me a little bit more if you wanna keep this fast connection.\u201d And, you know, the concern there is: that bump in price that, that Netflix has to pay, that gets passed on to the consumer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and what\u2019s the, like, worst-case scenario there? I think in a lot of conversations about net neutrality, the implication is that it\u2019s this, like, slippery slope that\u2019s gonna fundamentally change the Internet. What\u2019s the, the radically different Internet that people are worried we\u2019re gonna find our way into?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"That\u2019s a really good question. What I can say is, having talked to researchers like David Choffnes at Northeastern University, who studies what we would consider net neutrality violations\u2014so he\u2019s looked at how traffic that appears to go from my computer, let\u2019s say, or my phone to Netflix and how ISPs in the United States treat that, and it turns out that whether or not the FCC had net neutrality policies on the books, whether states had their own net neutrality laws didn\u2019t really matter in the United States. This study has been going on when we had FCC oversight, we haven\u2019t had FCC oversight, we had FCC oversight again, and now we, we don\u2019t, so\u2014David told me he\u2019s seen it all, and basically it [laughs], it doesn\u2019t really matter."},{"author":"","text":"David and his colleagues have seen, studying this since 2017, that your fixed cable Internet, there\u2019s no net neutrality violations there in the United States\u2014that, that they, they aren\u2019t blocking or throttling traffic. But what they have found is, for certain users on certain data plans, that wireless providers have throttled some connections. And the thinking there is, historically, the spectrum was limited, connecting to cell towers and things like that, so maybe when everybody\u2019s commuting home at 5 o\u2019clock that they\u2019re all requesting to watch Netflix on the subway or something, and it made sense to throttle that."},{"author":"","text":"Now, if you go into a cell phone store, folks will tout their super-fast ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"5G network things, so maybe that spectrum argument no longer holds water. But if they\u2019ve done it historically, maybe they\u2019d do it again. So all of that is to say, in the short term I don\u2019t know that American consumers will really notice a difference. In the long term maybe the price of your Hulu or Netflix subscription jacks up a little."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, and with so many giant conglomerates owning so many different types of media and telecommunications companies, it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that an ISP could also own some of the content you\u2019re watching versus [laughs] other content, so, yeah, for sure."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Maybe the only thing to note is: this has been going on for a really long time [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"The phrase \u201cnet neutrality\u201d was coined by a Columbia legal scholar in 2003. So people have been thinking about this for a really long time, and it just\u2014this debate has gone on\u2014you know, even, even before it was coined, even before we had the term \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d people have been thinking about the principles of the open Internet. So this certainly isn\u2019t the end of net neutrality; even though it\u2019s out of the FCC\u2019s hands for the foreseeable future, this doesn\u2019t mean that net neutrality is lost."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Ben, thanks so much for explaining net neutrality to me. I finally understand it, and hopefully the Internet stays relatively free and open for the foreseeable future."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Sounds great. Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
