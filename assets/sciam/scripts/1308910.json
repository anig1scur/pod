Just a heads-up, today\u2019s episode is about human sexuality. We talk about sex, sometimes using slang terms but without any profanity. I\u2019d probably give this episode a PG-13 rating. So if you usually listen with kids, maybe give this one a solo trial run to make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the questions it may raise. And if you just really don\u2019t like hearing people talk about sex, then this episode isn\u2019t for you! No hard feelings, we\u2019ll see you on Friday."},{"author":"","text":"Now that that\u2019s out of the way: the human body is capable of doing some pretty incredible things\u2014including things we don\u2019t yet understand. But few physical phenomena inspire as much speculation or debate as the one colloquially known as \u201csquirting.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"My guest today is Wendy Zukerman, host of the hit podcast Science Vs. You may remember her from her previous appearance on Science Quickly back in August. If not, I\u2019ll refresh your memory: we talked about anal sex. She\u2019s back today to tell us how Science Vs tackled the surprisingly controversial science of squirting."},{"author":"","text":"Wendy, welcome back to the show! It\u2019s so great to have you."},{"author":"Wendy Zukerman","text":"Oh, thank you so much for having me!"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So the last time you were on Science Quickly, you were talking about your deep dive into the science of anal sex\u2014the very neglected science of anal sex. Tell me about your latest sexual-health research endeavor."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"I know! Rachel, I wanted to tell the audience: We cover other issues, you know [laughs]?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Science Vs is a great, extremely varied show, and you are ..."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"[Laughs] We have a new season ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Back here today to talk about more sex stuff [laughs]."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Exactly. While this season is gonna cover ADHD, fluoride, methamphetamine, creatine, I am here to talk about the first episode of this season, which is on squirting."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Incredible. So there may be listeners who are like, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Great question."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So [laughs] yeah, what is it?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Well, yes, so it is this rather mysterious phenomena where folks who have a vagina, sometimes when they\u2019re extremely aroused, about to orgasm, at the moment of orgasm, a large amount of fluid will gush out of them. And it\u2019s this big mystery around: What is this fluid? Where is it coming from? Is it coming from the vagina, the urethra? Is it pee? Is it female ejaculate?"},{"author":"","text":"And for many years on the Internet you see these sort of fights playing out, and they often have this kind of political-ish tone to it, where often sort of feminist websites will argue, \u201cIt is not pee; we have a special ejaculate,\u201d and then you have these kind of other websites that are saying\u2014you know, they\u2019re kind of downplaying the squirt and saying, you know, \u201cNo, it is just pee.\u201d And then in the middle of that, you have a lot of people being angry."},{"author":"","text":"And so we just wanted to say, like, this is ridiculous. We\u2019re in 2025. How can a physiological phenomena, how can this thing cause so much drama and be so politicized? What is this liquid? We should be able to know [laughs]. We have very sophisticated science. We should be able to determine what this liquid is."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely. So what did you know about the concept going into making this episode?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So I have squirted, just sort of at the beginning of my sexual encounters. And for me, when it happened, I really thought it was pee."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"I was quite certain. I wasn\u2019t devastated or anything; I was just like, \u201cOh, bodies are weird, but I don\u2019t wanna be cleaning the sheets every time that this happens, so I\u2019m gonna kind of train my body not to do that,\u201d and I was able to."},{"author":"","text":"Nowadays it sort of has this very powerful element. It\u2019s part of porn, and it has these exciting elements to it, and it\u2019s sort of a real accomplishment that you have squirted. But I guess, still, to a lot of folks who do it, and we did this large survey of our listeners\u2014who has squirted and how many times and how they felt about it\u2014and you still see this sort of real confusion around how people feel about it, which is often tied to this idea of: What exactly is this liquid? And so I was just very curious myself where people were getting their evidence from here and what we could know about it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, I definitely wanna get into the survey itself, but first, with your episode on anal sex, you really found collaborators who were also mystified at the lack of research and who helped you, you know, make this very scientific. Were you able to do the same thing for squirting?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yeah, so with squirting we actually do have some data that has really probed this question of: What is that fluid? There\u2019s still a lot missing in the data\u2014so we have sort of a bunch of small studies that have been well-done, and so in this case, while our survey was really helpful to sort of capture how many folks this is happening to and how they feel about it, we were able to look at the peer-reviewed literature this time to really see what\u2019s going on here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, what is going on? What [laughs]?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Okay, so let me tell you about one of the studies that we found. It was done by a French gynecologist, and we spoke to him, Samuel Salama. It was very funny\u2014when I was chatting to him, I sort of asked him, \u201cWhy did you do a study on squirting?\u201d And as you\u2019ll hear, it\u2019s very well-thought-out, and he started, he\u2019s like\u2014I was gonna do a French accent, but I, I won\u2019t, save the listeners that; one accent will be enough. And he started going, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomena. At the time we really didn\u2019t know what the fluid was.\u201d And I was like, \u201cCome on, Sam. Why did you do the study on squirting?\u201d And he says, \u201cOkay, okay, okay. When I was younger\u2014\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cThank you.\u201d He said he had a lover, she squirted. They were both so curious what was going on. They tried to find out. They tried to ask friends and doctors, and no one gave them a credible explanation."},{"author":"","text":"And so years later he\u2019s studying sexology, he has a clinic that he can use that can really get to the bottom of this. I think he was asked\u2014everyone needs to do a research project as part of his studies. And he says, \u201cGreat, now\u2019s the opportunity.\u201d And so what he does is he gets seven what he called systematic squirters, which meant that these were folks who could squirt every single time they got aroused. \u2019Cause for some people it sort of happens every now and then, but if he\u2019s going to the trouble to do the experiment, he wants to make sure that these folks are gonna squirt when they need to squirt."},{"author":"","text":"So he gets the women to come into the lab, and what\u2019s really cool is that he does an ultrasound of their pelvis and bladder at various points of this squirting adventure. So first, he gets them to go to the bathroom and then ultrasounds their pelvis and bladder. And so he can see that after they\u2019ve gone to the bathroom, the bladder is empty. That\u2019s what should happen. And then he says, \u201cOkay, go into this very sort of sterile-looking room in the clinic and go forth.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"But what he did, which was very insightful, is he said, \u201cBefore you squirt, at the peak of arousal, get me to come back in\u2014I\u2019m gonna ultrasound your bladder again.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"And so\u2014which I just imagine what it would be like for these folks to hold on to that aroused state while you get [an] ultrasound of your bladder [laughs]. And then the ultrasound\u2019s done, and then he says, \u201cOkay ...\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"\u201cGet back to it.\u201d"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"\u201cGet to it. Now you can squirt.\u201d And he walks out of the room again. Then they squirt. He comes back into the room\u2014you can hear him on the tape, and he\u2019s sort of describing, \u201cThis liquid is everywhere.\u201d \u2019Cause in some cases it can be quite a lot of fluid coming out; the world record for squirt is 1.35 liters\u2014which don\u2019t make me translate that into gallons [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] No, that\u2019s a lot, though."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It\u2019s a lot of liquid. It\u2019s a lot of liquid. Think about ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, Americans know that a big bottle of soda is 2 liters, so we have a frame of reference [laughs]."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yes, okay\u2014I thought so!"},{"author":"","text":"So then he does another ultrasound of the bladder after the squirt is done, and what is really curious is that he saw that at the peak of arousal, before they had squirted\u2014so remember: their bladders were empty \u2019cause they\u2019d peed ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Before this whole process begins. Then he ultrasounds their bladder at peak of arousal, and he can see the bladder has filled up again."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yes, which is very curious and very interesting for anyone who has had the experience of going to the bathroom before a sexual activity, having sex, and then peeing straight after and wondering, \u201cThat\u2019s so crazy\u2014I just peed 15 minutes ago.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"But this is a very interesting phenomenon, and another study that got two folks, a straight couple, to have sex in an MRI, also noticed that the woman, their bladders filled up during arousal."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So it must be something about, you know, heart rate\u2019s going, blood\u2019s moving around, processes are moving faster. We\u2019re not exactly sure why this happens. But\u2014so bladder fills up. Then the squirt happens. Rachel, you wanna guess what\u2019s going on with the bladder?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I would guess that it empties, probably."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It did."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"The bladder was empty, telling us that the liquid was coming from the bladder."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yes. And Sam also looked at the chemicals inside the squirt \u2019cause he had all the liquid there, and he could see various chemicals that we tend to find in urine, so urea, uric acid, things like this. Other studies have found this as well, when they\u2019ve looked at the chemicals in squirt."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It\u2019s sometimes\u2014one study found that it was quite diluted."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, I was gonna say, it would make sense for it to be pretty dilute if the bladder\u2019s sort of quickly filling up again."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It would, although when I asked Sam about this, he said sometimes it\u2019s dilute and sometimes it\u2019s not ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"And so\u2014and he actually had a photo of the squirt, and it looked like yellow pee."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Maybe not the most concentrate pee one has ever produced, but it definitely did not look like water to me ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Got it, yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"And so from that study\u2014it\u2019s only seven women, but there\u2019s some very curious research that we also talk about in the episode that\u2019s also suggesting that the bulk of this fluid is coming from the bladder."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, so that mystery solved, but you also created this big survey that I think you said thousands of people responded to, so tell me a little bit about that."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Although mystery solved, there is a tiny bit more mystery, which explains why you have this battle online. Because although the bulk of the fluid is coming from urine, in some cases there is a little bit of this sort of other substance ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"That ends up in squirt, which comes from the female prostate. And we discuss at length\u2014there\u2019s a lot of sort of mystery, controversy around this gland. But both\u2014if you have a penis, a vagina, you do have sort of this prostate gland, although it looks quite different. And so that is where the bulk of this fight comes from, is that\u2014sort of this idea that, \u201cOkay, the bulk of squirt might be pee, but there\u2019s a little bit that comes from the female prostate and that therefore makes it different.\u201d And so, in our episode, we sort of discuss what on earth the female prostate is, some interesting new findings in that area, and whether that does sort of change the substance."},{"author":"","text":"At that point that becomes a sort of philosophical argument ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"You know, is this an Arnold Palmer situation? Is it a Shirley Temple? Is it a Manhattan with a dirty olive juice? You know, we had many chats around the office about: \u201cWhat does, what does this mean? Is it changing it? Is it not?\u201d And I think that just depends on your perspective. But to go back to the survey, and I think that is where sort of that\u2014it all kind of comes to the fore, is that because we do see this pattern\u2014and so our survey found this, but other research has as well\u2014that for those who tend to think it\u2019s pee, they generally feel more negative about squirting ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Which makes perfect sense. If you feel like you have just peed all over your partner or peed all over your bed, that\u2019s not necessarily a great thing, whereas if you feel like you have just ejaculated over your partner, well, you just had a sexy time. And so, in our survey, 45 percent of those with vaginas had squirted at least once in their lifetime. Other surveys show this as well. So that is a huge number of folks this is happening to. It tells us that this is a normal physiological process; you don\u2019t just get almost, you know, one and two of us. And I think you could feel good about it no matter what that substance is."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, were there any other surprising takeaways in the survey?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"The really interesting finding that I would love\u2014I know science funding is in a tough spot right now, but perhaps in future days: so squirting is always talked about [as] a phenomena that just happens if you have a vagina. And there\u2019s sort of been this assumption that if you have a penis, you do not squirt because you ejaculate instead\u2014that\u2019s the fluid coming out of you during sexy times. Because there\u2019s a lot of mysteries around the physiological process, we just thought we\u2019d ask people with penises, \u201cHave you squirted, too?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"We found that it was something like 7.6 percent of folks with penises said they squirted, too. And we explicitly said, you know, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about ejaculate ...\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"\u201cCum, this kind of thing.\u201d And that, we asked around to urologists about what they thought of this, and some were quite skeptical it would be that high, some thought maybe because, you know, we know that there\u2019s some mechanisms around the penis that if you are erect, you really shouldn\u2019t be able to pee because it sort of blocks off that process, which is\u2014thank you, evolution; you don\u2019t want someone peeing inside you. There\u2019s a lot of variation in the human spirit out there, and so sometimes that mechanism doesn\u2019t work that well, and so it makes sense that\u2014you know, one researcher we spoke to said it\u2019s possible that after a penis ejaculates, maybe if they then continue to be aroused, maybe then what comes out next is a bit more like pee. We really don\u2019t know. There was one case study in the literature that we found of someone with a penis who did squirt\u2014so this was sort of, like, a verified, singular case study of a man squirting. And then we have our survey, but that\u2019s all we know."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, a lot still to learn. Thank you so much for coming on to talk about this with us. I\u2019m really excited to listen to the whole episode on Science Vs."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Thank you so much.
