[creaking door? Scream? Discordant psycho-shower-scene type music?]. But some sounds\u2026some sounds\u2026are like nothing you\u2019ve ever heard before\u2026and nothing you\u2019d ever want to hear again. [Sound of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde] THAT was the sound of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. And if you\u2019re thinking, hold on, molecules don\u2019t make noise\u2026well, you\u2019re right. But that discordant nightmare was an audible soundscape that represents the chemical properties of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"What\u2019s even more eerie, is that while that sound may have made you want to crawl out of your skin and skitter towards the door, the chemical itself has a similar effect on ants. That\u2019s according to a study in the journal Patterns."},{"author":"Jean-Luc Boev","text":"\u00e9: The world of insects is full of chemical compounds."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Jean-Luc Boev\u00e9 of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"Thomas Eisner\u2026who set up the field of chemical ecology\u2026 said that the insects are\u2026the best chemists on earth. And he said this as a kind of joke but he was totally true in saying this because insects are producing rich amounts of different chemicals for different purposes."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Including keeping themselves and their families safe."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"Many other insect groups are producing volatiles and other compounds to defend themselves against predators."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Like an overpowering perfume, these volatile secretions waft through the air and irritate critters who might be thinking of noshing on the bugs that produced them. Boev\u00e9, in particular, studies the larvae of sawfly species, which produce different cocktails of chemicals that act as a repellant, especially against ants. But Boev\u00e9 is not only an entomologist. He\u2019s also an amateur musician. And he got to thinking, well, smells transmit a signal by drifting through the air\u2026and so do sounds."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"I thought that it would be quite interesting to go deeper into this parallel between the perception via two different sensory systems namely smelling and hearing. So the idea was to convert these volatiles into sounds. Then\u2026to compare, on the one hand, predators reacting against the volatiles with, on the other hand, humans hearing sounds that represent these volatiles."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Step one was transforming aroma into audio. To do that, Boev\u00e9 and his colleague Rudi Giot of the Higher Industrial Institute of Brussels turned to a process called sonification, which translates chemical parameters into sounds."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"The chemical parameters that we used for instance it was the molecular weight of compound, or the fact that the compound possesses or not some functional groups. By functional group I mean an alcohol group or ketone group or aldehyde group or acid group."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"These molecular properties were then mapped to musical qualities, like pitch and tone, duration and timbre, even reverberation."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"Doing so we built up a library of the molecule sounds obtained by converting each molecule into one sound."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So acetic acid\u2026basically a concentrated vinegar\u2026sounds like: [Acetic acid sounds] \u2026while geranial, an isomer of citral, which is a main component of the oil in a citrus fruit's peel, sounds more like: [Geranial sounds]"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Boev\u00e9 is not the first to use sonification to convert chemical data into audio waves. As early as the 1970s, geneticists were transforming the four letters of DNA sequences into tunes that were, well, not exactly chart-topping."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"The sounds were\u2026not very nice, not very rich. Because if you have only four tones, then the music or the sound that you hear are\u2026very monotonous."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"The insect irritants were much more interesting\u2026because each species produces its own signature chemical blend. Boev\u00e9 and Giot mimicked those molecular mixtures by taking the individual chemical sounds and mixing them together on a sound board\u2026using different volumes to represent the concentrations of compounds in each species\u2019 toxic concoction. [Locust sawfly larva sounds]"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That\u2019s the chemical stylings of Nematus tibialis, a locust sawfly larva. Which is heavy on the dolichodial, an essential oil that some plants use as an insect repellant. [Dolichodiol sounds] And this pungent tune helps keep Hoplocampa testudinea, the European apple sawfly, from being eaten. [European apple sawfly sounds]"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"But that\u2019s just the setup. Then came the experiment. Boev\u00e9 exposed ants to the actual chemicals\u2026either individually or in mixtures\u2026and recorded how thoroughly the predators were repulsed by each. And for the sonified sounds\u2026volunteers would play clips\u2026of single molecules or mixtures\u2026and listen to the sounds from a pair of loudspeakers."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"Then we asked them to go backward, walk backward until they were at a comfort zone. And I was measuring, I was noting the distance that they walked backward."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"And he found that the molecules and mixtures that were most annoying to ants were the same ones that, when sonified, caused volunteers to retreat."},{"author":"Boev\u00e9","text":"And many told me that some sounds were quite frightening and that\u2019s why they went backward."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"But Boev\u00e9 isn\u2019t in it for the scares. The correlation between a chemical\u2019s effect on ants\u2026and a sound\u2019s effect on people\u2026means that he can use sonification to study the defensive scents of new species\u2026or species for which it might be hard to scare up a specimen."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Scare up?
