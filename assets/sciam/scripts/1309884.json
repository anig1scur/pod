And surprisingly, younger women who have never smoked are increasingly being diagnosed with the disease."},{"author":"","text":"Here to explain what could be driving this trend\u2014and why early screening can make all the difference\u2014is Jonathan Villena, a thoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for joining us."},{"author":"Jonathan Villena","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So our viewers and listeners might be surprised to hear that lung cancer [deaths] in women now tops breast cancer, ovarian cancer combined. Can you tell us more about what\u2019s going on there?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"Yeah, definitely. So in general lung cancer is the number-one cancer [killing] people in the U.S., both men and women. If you look at the American Cancer Society, around 226 new\u2014226,000 new cases of lung cancer are projected to be diagnosed in 2025. Of those about 50 percent are cancer-related deaths, meaning [roughly] 120,000 people die every year from lung cancer. Now, what\u2019s\u2014the good news is that the incidence has actually been decreasing in the last few years."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"If you look at the American Cancer Society\u2019s statistics, in the last 10 years [ of data, which goes through 2021], the, the incidence of lung cancer has decreased in men around 3 percent per year. And it\u2019s about half of that in women, meaning it\u2019s decreasing [roughly] 1.5 percent per year. So one of the reasons that they think that this might be happening is that there was an uptick in smoking in women around the \u201960s and \u201970s, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a slight, you know, decrease in the incidence in men but not so much in the women."},{"author":"","text":"What\u2019s more interesting and very surprising is the fact that when you look at younger people, meaning less than 65 years old\u2014especially younger never-smoking people\u2014there\u2019s actually an increase of women in that subgroup. They\u2019re overrepresented, and that\u2019s something very surprising."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Does the research offer us any clues about what\u2019s going on in this demographic of younger women?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"Yeah, so there\u2019s been a lot of research. So, you know, in general\u2014and something that people don\u2019t know is that about 20 percent of lung cancers actually occur in people that have never smoked in their entire lives."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"This is something that we don\u2019t really understand why this happens to this one in five people, but there are some risk factors associated with it. Number one is exposure to radon, which is a natural gas that sometimes people are exposed to for a prolonged time. Number two is secondhand smoking ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"So they don\u2019t smoke directly, but they live in a household where they smoke. And number three are kind of other environmental factors, things such as working in a specific, you know, manufacturing plant that deals with specific chemicals. And then lastly, the one that has had, actually, had a lot of research into it are genetic factors. There\u2019s definitely a preponderance of certain mutations in somebody\u2019s genes that can cause lung cancer, and that is overrepresented in women."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Do women face any unique challenges in getting diagnosed or treated when it comes to lung cancer?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"So, yes. First of all, you know, how do we treat or catch lung cancer? So the newest and, and latest way of catching this disease is actually through lung cancer screening.That\u2019s something that\u2019s relatively new; it\u2019s only happened in the last 10 years. And that\u2019s in certain demographics, meaning that if someone is over 50 years old and they have smoked more than one pack per day for 20 years, they meet the criteria for lung cancer screening, which is basically a radiograph or a CAT scan of their lungs. That\u2019s the way that we pick up lung cancer."},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s the\u2014almost the exact same thing that people have for breast cancer, such as mammography, or colonoscopy. So that\u2019s before any symptoms come in. That\u2019s really just to try to capture it when it\u2019s in very nascent stages, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Where it\u2019s very small or not symptomatic. And that\u2019s the way we diagnose a, a lot of lung cancer."},{"author":"","text":"Now, that being said, there\u2019s a couple of things. So first of all, [roughly] 60 to 70 percent of people, like, in general get mammographies."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"[About] 60 to 70 percent of people get colonoscopies. Only 6 percent of people actually get lung cancer screening. So it\u2019s dismally low."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Villena","text":"The reason being that sometimes people don\u2019t know about it; it\u2019s relatively new. Sometimes even doctors don\u2019t know about it. There\u2019s also a little bit of guilt involved, where people, you know, they think they did it to themselves by smoking ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"So they don\u2019t wanna go do it. The second thing is that, as you could imagine, this is only for high-risk individuals or people that have a history of smoking, all right? So it misses these never-smoking one in five patients. So that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re actively working on."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, how else does the, you know, the stigma associated with lung cancer because of its association with smoking, how does that impact people\u2019s ability to get diagnosed and treated?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"I think there\u2019s a lot of hesitancy between patients. There\u2019s, you know, a recent study that showed that people are more\u2014have more tendency to downplay their smoking history, meaning that if they quit, let\u2019s say 10 years ago, you tell your doctor that you never smoked."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"And that\u2019s something very common. Or if you smoked, you know, one pack a day, maybe you say you smoked half a pack a day because you feel that guilt. So then you don\u2019t give your doctor or your caretaker the full picture. And sometimes that prevents you from getting these tests, right? So there\u2019s definitely that attitude."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s also a bit of a fatalistic attitude, sort of like, \u201cI did it to myself. I\u2019d rather not know. You know, this is something that\u2014you know, I made that choice, and if I get cancer, that\u2019s my choice.\u201d Right? So that\u2019s, that\u2019s also another attitude that we\u2019re constantly trying to change in patients. You know, the treatment, once you capture it, is all the same, but really it\u2019s about getting screening and it\u2019s about finding the lung cancer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So with smoking no longer necessarily being the driving factor, at least in this younger demographic, what kinds of risk factors should we be talking about more?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"So I think, you know\u2014so smoking is always number one."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Villena","text":"In the never-smoking people it\u2019s either radon, secondhand smoking or environmental factors, and then a little bit of genetics plays, plays a part."},{"author":"","text":"Radon is something that people can test for in their homes. It\u2019s something that people should read up on. So that\u2019s number one: if you have exposure to that, to get rid of that."},{"author":"","text":"If you are in, in an environment, let\u2019s say you work with chemicals that you think, you know, are astringent or have caused\u2014causes you to have coughs or, you know, affects you in any sort of way, to kind of try to talk to your employer to work in a more ventilated setting."},{"author":"","text":"Really important with genetic factors is understanding your family history."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"If you have a mother, a grandmother, a grandfather who died of cancer or you have a lot of cancer in your family, sometimes understanding that and knowing that from your, you know, from your family perspective will actually clue a doctor in to doing further tests, to looking into that further, \u2019cause that sometimes is passed down and you can have the same genes."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Are there any big research questions that scientists need to answer about lung cancer, specifically in young women?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"So, you know, there\u2019s so much to look at, all right? So if we think about just the genetic aspect of it, there\u2019s one specific gene called the EGFR gene\u2014or it\u2019s a mutation that\u2019s found in lung cancer that in, if you look at all people with lung cancer, it\u2019s found in about 15 percent ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Of the population with lung cancer. Now, if you look at never-smoking Asian women that get lung cancer, it\u2019s about 60 percent of them ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Have that mutation. So the important thing about that EGFR mutation is there\u2019s a specific drug for that mutation, all right?"},{"author":"","text":"So there\u2019s definitely a lot of genetic kind of information that we\u2019re still actively researching. But the important thing about this genetic information is that there\u2019s drugs targeted specifically for those mutations. So the more we know, the more we understand, the better."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So for folks who are hearing this and are surprised and, and maybe concerned what is your advice for how they should proceed, how they should look into their risk factors?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"You know, I think one of the, the, the major aspects of health in general is understanding your own health."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"I think that younger people tend to delay care, tend to not see their doctors, and because, one, they\u2019re busy, right, at their very busy moment in their lives. But second is that, you know, you don\u2019t wanna deal with it, and you think that you will not get cancer, that you will not get this disease because you\u2019re young and you\u2019ve never smoked and you\u2019ve never done anything bad."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"But, you know, you have to be very aware of your body, so what are the kind of top four symptoms? So number one, let\u2019s say you have a cough, and that cough lasts for longer than two weeks, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"A normal cold, things like that will go away after a couple of weeks. But if it\u2019s there for a couple of months, and I\u2019ve definitely seen patients that tell me in retrospect, you know, \u201cI\u2019ve had this cough for three months,\u201d right, and it should have been checked up sooner. So understanding yourself, understanding your body, not, you know, waiting for things, not procrastinating, which is very hard to do, but you should definitely see your doctor ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Regularly."},{"author":"","text":"Second is, like I said before, understanding your family, right, and what your genetic makeup is, right? Knowing your family history, understanding if your parents, grandparents had cancer, etcetera, or other chronic diseases."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"And that\u2019s, that\u2019s basically the, the major aspects of it. It\u2019s really being in tune with yourself."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So once a patient is actually diagnosed, what does treatment look like?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"So treatment for lung cancer, actually, is heavily dependent on the stage. There\u2019s everything from stage 1, in which it\u2019s localized to one portion of a lung, to stage 4, where it actually has gone to other parts of the body."},{"author":"","text":"Now, stage 1 disease, you basically need a simple surgery, where that lung nodule, or that lung cancer, is surgically removed, and typically you don\u2019t need any other treatments. So stage 1 is what we look for. Stage 1 is the reason that lung cancer screening works because stage 1 doesn\u2019t really have any symptoms ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"So when you find it that early patients do very well."},{"author":"","text":"Stage 4, once it\u2019s left the lung, you are no longer a surgical candidate, unless in, you know, sometimes very specific cases, but for the most part you\u2019re no longer a surgical candidate. And there you need systemic treatments."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And how long does the treatment tend to take for a stage 1 patient, if it\u2019s just a surgical procedure?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"So if it\u2019s just a surgical procedure, look, I do these surgeries all the time: the patient comes in; we do the surgery; the patients usually go home the next day."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Villena","text":"And then we follow the patient and get CAT scans every six months for a long time to make sure nothing comes back or nothing new comes. So it\u2019s pretty straightforward, and we do this all the time. We do these surgeries robotically now. Patients recover incredibly well, and they\u2019re out, you know, doing\u2014living their lives in a couple of weeks. So it\u2019s really something very, very, very efficient."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so huge incentive to get checked early."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Are there any advances in treatment, you know, any new treatments that doctors are excited about?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"Yeah, so there\u2019s two major steps forward that have changed lung cancer treatment. Number one is something called targeted therapy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"So that means that there\u2019s a drug that targets a specific mutation. So just how I was speaking about earlier about the EGFR mutation in young, never-smoking Asian women, there is a drug that targets that mutation that has really shown amazing results at all stages now."},{"author":"","text":"And the second one is actually immunotherapy, which won the Nobel Prize, which is this idea that you can use your own body\u2019s immune system to kill the cancer cell. So cancer is very smart\u2014what it does is it evades your immune system; it pretends that it\u2019s part of your own body. And what this drug does is that it basically reawakens your immune system to recognize that cancer again and kill it. And we\u2019ve seen amazing results, even in the stage 4 patients, where they are potentially cured of cancer, which, which we\u2019ve never seen before."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What motivated you to get into this specialty?"},{"author":"Villena","text":"You know, I do have a family history of this in an uncle that passed away from lung cancer ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"And he was a heavy smoker. And, you know, I saw how, basically, decimated his, he was\u2014[his] life [was], basically. He was a very vibrant guy, he was very active, and in six months he was gone, right?"},{"author":"","text":"And I think, you know, once I started getting into, you know, medical school and understanding things, one of the major things that I really got into was research. And I see that if my uncle had been treated 20 years ago, he potentially could have been saved ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Villena","text":"Because of these advances in research. And right now we are right at the cusp where we are learning all these new things, and we actually have the tools to change how patients are treated, you know? And this\u2014every year there\u2019s a new treatment, which prior to that, there was no new treatment; i t was basically just chemo, and that\u2019s it, all right? So I think that that really motivated me\u2014something that I can actually take part in and actually change the course for a lot of people."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today.
