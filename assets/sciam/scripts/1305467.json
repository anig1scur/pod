More and more people say they no longer have the urge to do these things.\u00a0These anecdotal reports have left researchers wondering whether these new weight-loss drugs can serve as a basis for addiction treatments. Our colleague Lauren Young, an associate health editor at SciAm, recently edited a story about this by our contributor Sara Reardon. Lauren is here to talk about what we\u2019re learning about weight loss drugs and addiction. Lauren, welcome back to Your Health, Quickly!"

      "text": ": So, tell us how researchers first started looking into these drugs for addiction treatment."
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Yeah, so connection between these weight loss drugs and addiction has been an ongoing question for researchers for quite some time. And that\u2019s because the drugs target a biological pathway that seems to affect both appetite and pleasure.\u00a0So when you eat food, your pancreas produces a hormone called GLP-1. As you eat, GLP-1 levels increase, eventually signaling to the rest of the body that you\u2019re full.\u00a0This also reduces your craving for food. But in some people with obesity or diabetes, GLP-1 levels can get disrupted, which causes the body to consume more food than it needs instead of recognizing that it\u2019s full."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman: ",
      "text": "I\u2019m a little confused here. Drugs like Ozempic make you eat less, not more. So do they mess around with your GLP-1 levels? And so when they do this, do they raise them or lower them?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young",
      "text": ": They raise them! It works like this: Ozempic and Wegovy, which were both developed by the company Novo Nordisk, are brands of one specific drug called semaglutide.\u00a0Semaglutide is a type of GLP-1 agonist, which means that it binds to and activates specific receptors in the body.\u00a0In this case, semaglutide is triggering GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas, causing the organ to pump out more of the hormone."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis: ",
      "text": "So you don\u2019t get food cravings."
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. Scientists also know that GLP-1 seems to affect the brain\u2019s reward pathways by lowering levels of dopamine\u2014that \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone that makes eating food feel pleasurable.... And those reward pathways and dopamine also play a major role in addiction."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": That makes a lot of sense. So basically GLP-1 makes you want to stop eating and put the fork down. But do we know anything about the mechanism behind addiction to things like nicotine, and how these drugs might work to tackle that?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "So understanding addiction is where things get messy.\u00a0Here\u2019s what some researchers have been theorizing, though: addictive substances such as nicotine and opioids are generally thought to take over the brain\u2019s natural reward pathways.\u00a0So continuously using such drugs causes the brain to need more and more dopamine to function, and that leads to addiction. There are also other explanations on the table: some addiction researchers think that substance use may be driven by both pleasurable rewards and by fear of the negative emotions and physical side effects of withdrawal."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": So in their theory, the brain sees a substance like nicotine as an essential physiological need\u2014similar to our basic need for food."
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "That\u2019s right. And researchers suspect that GLP-1 agonists, such as semaglutide, might \u201cshort-circuit\u201d that association."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis: ",
      "text": "Huh, that\u2019s really fascinating. And how well do they work?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Well, various research groups are currently working on human trials to answer that question.\u00a0In 2022 a research group completed the largest trial in humans so far using exenatide, another GLP-1 agonist drug.\u00a0The researchers found that people with alcohol use disorder who took exenatide had less activity in the brain\u2019s reward centers when they were shown pictures of alcohol\u2014which is an indication that they craved it less.\u00a0But only study participants with obesity ended up drinking significantly less than their peers who received a placebo."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": That\u2019s a little weird. Why would obesity have anything to do with actual drinking here?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "That\u2019s a great question, and researchers aren\u2019t sure yet. It\u2019s unclear why the study found that the drug only lowered alcohol consumption in people with obesity.\u00a0But it could suggest that these anecdotal reports we\u2019re hearing of addiction disappearing could be skewed because many people who are prescribed a GLP-1 agonist are often overweight to begin with."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman: ",
      "text": "So what you\u2019re saying is it\u2019s possible these drugs might not work the same way for everyone, huh?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Yes. The research group that led the original study is planning a followup clinical trial to tackle this question about weight.\u00a0Other researchers are also running studies on GLP-1 agonists and addiction.\u00a0For instance, researchers at Penn State University are running a clinical trial in people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder.\u00a0While scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are testing semaglutide in people with alcohol and nicotine addictions.\u00a0If those results are promising, these experts are hoping that GLP-1 agonist drugs can one day give clinicians and patients another addiction treatment option."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman: ",
      "text": "That would be great\u2014if it pans out.\u00a0 But as these drugs are used more widely, for a bunch of different purposes, I wanted to ask how safe they are. Are there any concerns about the safety or side effects of these drugs?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Yeah, and researchers are concerned about that, too. They want to make sure that these drugs would be safe for people with certain types of addiction or health conditions.\u00a0So we know that GLP-1 agonists have been proven safe for most people, but experts are concerned that they could cause problems in people who are malnourished from opioid or methamphetamine use, for instance.\u00a0Another concern is that GLP-1 agonists might be too good at dampening the pleasure and reward pathways, to the point where they would cause disruptions in mood or motivation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": That\u2019s an interesting question. And I know that drugs like Ozempic have side effects such as nausea and vomiting that can cause users to stop taking them\u2014and I doubt that would be good for people who need to stay on treatment for addiction."
    },
    {
      "author": "Young",
      "text": ": Definitely. There are also a lot of questions about whether or not a GLP-1 agonist would be a lifelong addiction treatment.\u00a0For instance, Ozempic helps manage diabetes, but people need to take it for the rest of their lives.\u00a0And people who take semaglutide for weight loss often regain the pounds if they stop taking the medication."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis: ",
      "text": "Yeah, that seems to be a common problem. So would people with substance use disorder also need to be on it for life?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young",
      "text": ": We don\u2019t know, but ideally, the GLP-1 agonist would be used as a short-term treatment that curbs addiction long enough for people to make lifestyle changes that help them stay sober."

      "text": "What else needs to happen next for these new addiction treatments to become a reality, Lauren?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Young: ",
      "text": "Yeah. Even after more human trials, there\u2019s still a long way to go. The Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved GLP-1 agonists to be used for addiction.\u00a0Our contributor Sara Reardon also reached out to Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. They said they are not currently running or planning trials to investigate addiction. They\u2019re staying focused on diabetes and weight loss\u2014for now."
