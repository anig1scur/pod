Your feet will get soaked like a wet sponge."},{"author":"Gabriel Hould Gosselin (tape): ","text":"Almost\u00a0there. [laughs] About halfway. Well, it\u2019s a lot faster with snowmobiles."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": Hey, I\u2019m Jocie Bentley, and this is the final episode of a three-part Science, Quickly Fascination series from a fast-warming Arctic. Today I\u2019m heading to a place called the Trail Valley Creek Research Station, high in the Canadian Arctic. I\u2019m sloshing along with Gabriel Hould Gosselin. Gabriel is a research assistant for Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario and the University of Montreal. We actually did his original interviews in French, so you are listening to a combination of field audio and a new interview in English."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"Alright, so I brought you about 60 kilometers north of Inuvik, which is a little town at the top of the Northwest Territories, out near the Tuktoyaktuk highway in the tundra."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": We passed the tree line on our drive. No more trees, just a flat carpet of orange and red tundra, covering softly rolling hills. It\u2019s unlike any landscape I\u2019ve ever seen."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"There\u2019s permafrost all over the place. It\u2019s super deep. It\u2019s, like, four- to 600 meters, depending, deep."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"So for all you nonmetric listeners, that\u2019s 1,300 to almost 2,000 feet deep. That\u2019s deeper than almost all of the world\u2019s tallest skyscrapers."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"And that\u2019s permafrost being permanently frozen ground, ground that doesn\u2019t go above zero degrees Celsius. Of course, the top layer kind of thaws over summer and then refreezes over winter."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"And that is exactly the part that Gabriel is most interested in."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"That\u2019s the area that is active, that has bacteria kind of decomposing organic matter and farting out carbon dioxide and methane ..."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"I mean, there\u2019s this kind of methane bomb. That's what people are thinking about, and thinking ..."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"The more there is, the more trouble we\u2019re in."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"Oh, boy, if things keep on warming, there\u2019s a whole bunch of ground that\u2019s been frozen for a long time with basically a huge pool of carbon that\u2019s just ready to be digested by those methane-producing bacteria."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"And that\u2019s a huge concern for researchers such as Gabriel."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"What\u2019s going to happen? And that\u2019s, that\u2019s a concern. What\u2019s going on in the Arctic?"},{"author":"Bentley","text":": And that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. There\u2019s only one way to learn the answer to that question, and it\u2019s with data."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"There\u2019s been very little real sampling that\u2019s been done. I mean, there\u2019s more and more stuff that comes out. There\u2019s more and more satellites that are put out there that are much better and better at looking at different wavelengths. Some of them use radar. Some of them use infrared. Some of them actually see, measure directly, the amount of methane that\u2019s in the air in certain areas."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": But those methods are less reliable without actual measurements from the ground."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"To validate those measurements, we need ground-truthing data, so, data that comes from the area that that satellite\u2019s looking at to kind of compare what\u2019s being measured and from up there and then what\u2019s being measured from the ground."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": And that\u2019s why we\u2019re standing among a bunch of white tents on red tundra. It\u2019s all cleaned up for the offseason."},{"author":"Bentley (tape)","text":": Is it not normally this clean?"},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"I mean, normally there\u2019s a bunch of people living here, so there\u2019s stuff everywhere. Uh, normally we have a bug net, like, uh, one of those, uh, kind of gazebo bug net things. Yeah. And then we set up tents all around here. I mean, normally there\u2019s a whole bunch of chairs, and, uh, you know, when we get a heater going, people kind of, it\u2019s where we eat and just spend our time. It\u2019s tea! And it\u2019s nice and clean."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": We make our way to Gabriel\u2019s main research station. It\u2019s called an eddy covariance tower."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"A private company installed the tower. I just installed the instruments on it. Yeah, I spent 30 hours on it."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": So he climbed 20 meters, or 65 feet, up this skinny tower carrying giant pieces of equipment. Here\u2019s what he installed."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"So on the tower for eddy covariance, in principle, there\u2019s two main instruments: one instrument that measures the concentration of gas that we\u2019re interested in in the air and [another] that uses infrared."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": Remember those greenhouse gas farts? This is how science \u201csniffs\u201d them out."},{"author":"Gosselin: ","text":"So basically, we know, per volume, the amount of carbon dioxide or water vapor that\u2019s in that parcel there. And \u00a0 we\u2019re using ultrasound to measure it about 10 times a second\u2014the speed of wind and the X, Y and Z direction. And then we do the covariance between the vertical movements of wind and the concentration of gas."},{"author":"Bentley (tape)","text":": Do we have enough towers in the North to get an accurate picture?"},{"author":"Gosselin (tape): ","text":"No, we do not. It\u2019s incredibly difficult and costly to just get something out there. Just to go in those environments is really expensive. The biggest challenge that I found doing stuff out there is not necessarily the cold or, like, the mosquitoes or whatever. It\u2019s getting enough power for all of those instruments that measure 24 hours a day, 10 times a second."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": Is tundra really that different that we need testing in all these different locations? How does it differ?"},{"author":"Gosselin (tape): ","text":"You try to draw, like, not a paint-by-numbers but, you know, one of those little, and then you have to kind of draw a line."},{"author":"Bentley (tape): ","text":"Connect the dots!"},{"author":"Gosselin (tape): ","text":"Yeah. But basically, you get an entire image with four points, and you have to draw an elephant. Like, it\u2019s not going to look like an elephant. It\u2019s going to look like a square. So it\u2019s the same thing. Like, you\u2019re trying to get a detailed image of what, like, how different types of landscapes in the North behave. But if we only have four points, we\u2019re going to be missing a lot of detail, and maybe some of the details are going to be important."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": How big of a problem is this? How worried should we be?"},{"author":"Gosselin","text":": There\u2019s been very little\u00a0real sampling that\u2019s been done. I don\u2019t want to be alarmist. There\u2019s always the kind of trap for scientists. They just go, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not qualified enough.\u201d And then basically that\u2019s taken, um, by the media saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s a problem.\u201d Of course it\u2019s concerning. Of course we have to do something. In fact, we\u2019re past the point of no return. Things are going to happen. Things are warming up already beyond our control. And the consequences of that are happening now and are going to happen. By how much, I can\u2019t say."},{"author":"Bentley","text":": Science, Quickly is produced by Jeffrey DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper. Our music was composed by Dominic Smith.
