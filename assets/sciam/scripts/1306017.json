      "text": ": The new weapon is one part of a plan that was started under former President Barack Obama. It was accelerated by the Trump administration to replace and upgrade the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal \u2014 at a projected cost of upward of $1.5 trillion over the next 30 years. It\u2019s a project that will perpetuate, until at least 2075, the little-known role that my tribe\u2014the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota\u2014plays in U.S. National Security policy: to be a nuclear target. You\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s podcast series The Missiles on Our Rez. I\u2019m Ella Weber, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, a Princeton student, and a journalist.\u00a0 This is Episode 3: \u201cThe Air Force\u2019s New Nuclear Missile.\u201d\u00a0 In this episode, we\u2019ll be talking about how the Air Force came to our reservation to present its new missile project to the tribe, and how this fits into the broader patterns that have characterized our historical relationship with the U.S. government. [CLIP: Air Force environmental impact statement video: \u201cThe National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, is a federal law that requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making process. NEPA review is required when a federal action is proposed that may have impacts on the human or natural environment. NEPA includes requirements for involvement of the public and government entities and, in the case of this project, 62 Native American Tribes.\u201d]\u00a0"
