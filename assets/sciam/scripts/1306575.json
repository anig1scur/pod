This is part one of a four-part Fascination on the science of pleasure. In this series, we\u2019re asking what we can learn from those with marginalized experiences to explore sexuality, find the female orgasm and illuminate asexuality. In this episode, we\u2019ll take you inside the world of BDSM, which stands for \u201cbondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism.\u201d Practitioners say that, when done with proper consent and communication, rough sex can be not only pleasurable but also healing."},{"author":"Chase ","text":"[CLIP: in Intro to Whips class: \u201cThis is a kink whip class....

But as rough sex moves away from the margins, more people are engaging in it without educating themselves. At the same time, researchers say that BDSM can be liberating and healing, especially for people with a history of trauma."},{"author":"McDonough ","text":"(tape): Okay, so I\u2019m recording.... Where are we right now? Can you describe it in very visual terms for our listeners?"},{"author":"Charlotte Taillor","text":"We are in the back room of the Crown, which ... we use for our house dungeon.... It has velvety black curtains on one side.... There\u2019s also a frame, suspension frame. So we are sitting right under it on a makeshift bondage table."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"This is Charlotte Taillor, a professional dominatrix and educator who founded the Taillor Group in 2016. Charlotte says most people attending her workshops at the beginning were professional dominatrices and sex workers, but as her school has gotten more press, she\u2019s gotten more curious laypeople."},{"author":"Taillor: ","text":"We have workshops on everything, like, from BDSM 101 to water sports..., ropes, bondage without ropes."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"(tape): Can you tell me sort of how we got to this space? Like, how did you start your journey into BDSM?"},{"author":"Taillor: ","text":"I mean, I\u2019m queer. And I think that there\u2019s a big intersection. I went to a party in New York and met a few doms, and not all of them were professional doms. But they were, they\u2019re just really cool."},{"author":"Debby Herbenick: ","text":"There\u2019s actually this really rich and wonderful history within LGBTQ communities where rough sex is\u2026. a form of liberation."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"This is Debby Herbenick, a researcher at Indiana University Bloomington who has studied sexuality for more than 20 years. In 2021 she found that, of about 5,000 undergraduate students who participated in a confidential survey, almost 80 percent of those with a current partner reported engaging in rough sex, an umbrella term that includes choking, spanking, smothering, name-calling, and more. In her study, people who self-identified as bisexual were nearly twice as likely to report greater frequency of rough sex, and transgender and nonbinary participants also reported greater frequency and enjoyment of rough sex. (The authors did not ask how often participants had sex in general, though, or to what extent rough sex behaviors were communicated about and consensual.)"},{"author":"Herbenick: ","text":"You can realize that the sexual menu is actually really broad. And you get to choose the sexual life that you want for yourself, and you can explore that."},{"author":"McDonough: ","text":"Debby also found that men in her study were more likely to report initiating rough sex, whereas women were more likely to report their partner initiating it."},{"author":"Herbenick: ","text":"With heterosexual people, you often see, like, men choking women. There\u2019s not a lot of women choking men, right\u2014because there\u2019s not a lot of exploring gender roles. And so when you look at more, like, queer communities, there\u2019s an openness to saying, well, like, \u201cLet me try it this way\u201d or \u201cHow would you like to try this?\u201d"},{"author":"McDonough: ","text":"Debby says that, across the board, people engage in rough sex for reasons that are both physiological and psychological. But it can become dangerous without the right education."},{"author":"Herbenick: ","text":"Frankly, most doctors will tell you, like, choking in general is something that probably everybody should stay away from.... There is no, like, zero-risk way of engaging in choking\u2014because it still involves either, you know, reducing blood flow to and from the brain or reducing airflow, depending on how people do it, or both. And so that\u2019s not good for the brain either in the short term or the long term. But a lot of people don\u2019t want to hear that. Some people describe psychological feelings, of feeling on either the giving or receiving end that, like..., \u201cI have my partner\u2019s life in my hands. And of course, I\u2019m trustworthy\u201d\u2014or feeling, like, the eroticism of your partner having your life in their hands."},{"author":"McDonough: ","text":"Debby started studying rough sex more closely when, in 2016, she began to notice more questions about the topic than usual from her undergraduate students. Not long after, her team did a survey of randomly sampled students and noticed a sharp rise in participation: among the nearly 1,800 respondents who reported having a romantic or sexual partner... around 80 percent of the students reported having engaged in rough sex."},{"author":"Herbenick: ","text":"I had never seen a sexual behavior go from... really low participation to extremely high rates of participation in a short period of time."},{"author":"McDonough (tape)","text":"And what are your theories about why that\u2019s been the case?"},{"author":"Herbenick","text":"I think if people had been tracking it earlier than anyone was, we would have mainly seen pornography as the main driver.... And I think that was one early influence. I think Fifty Shades of Grey was another influence.... And if you look now, it's just kind of everywhere."},{"author":"McDonough (tape)","text":"So you mentioned that education is really important, but it\u2019s lacking in this area....For people who are interested in exploring rough sex and choking, what would you say are the first questions they should be asking or how should they talk about this with their sexual partner?"},{"author":"Herbenick: ","text":"So I think, you know, first rough sex is really broad and diverse, right? So rough sex includes things like light spanking, hard spanking, you know, smothering, choking or strangulation, name-calling, all sorts of things. So I think a good first question is just asking somebody what they\u2019re into and not pressuring anybody to be into anything they\u2019re not and also feeling comfortable standing up for yourself if you\u2019re not interested in something that your partner is interested in. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s just too risky for me\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that.\u201d"},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Without this piece, rough sex turns into abuse. The American Psychiatric Association agrees, which is why it announced in 2010 that it would change its definitions for sexual interests such as BDSM in the 2013 update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to distinguish consenting activity among adults from disorders that cause harm or distress. But public perception is still catching up."},{"author":"Taillor","text":"That\u2019s the biggest misconception, is that the actions are really what is. I mean, the actions of BDSM without the whole negotiation and chat and aftercare and dynamic and care\u2014it\u2019s legit just abuse."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Charlotte, the dominatrix and educator we heard from earlier, uses a checklist in her collective based on the acronym \u201cMITS\u201d: marks, injuries, triggers and safe word. Lady Harper demonstrated this with the submissive who volunteered to be part of the Intro to Whips workshop."},{"author":"Chase ","text":"[CLIP: and a volunteer speak in Intro to Whips]"},{"author":"Chase","text":"[: \u201cThings that I like to cover before I hit a human: marks\u2014is it okay?

But to me, in my experience, there would be no dominant urges if there wasn\u2019t a submissive telling me what would be valuable for them."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"This brings us to another point. Kinksters and researchers say that if done with care, BDSM can be not only pleasurable but also healing for those involved."},{"author":"Chase: ","text":"I know plenty of people who would say, \u201cI never want someone to spank me because it brings up experiences from my past that I would rather forget....\u201d Other people will say that they want to be spanked consensually so that they\u2019re the ones controlling that experience. Though they have recollections of it in a nonconsensual instance from their past, they now control it, and therefore, they\u2019re regaining that control over a memory or an experience that their body once had."},{"author":"McDonough: ","text":"Here\u2019s Debby again."},{"author":"Herbenick","text":"Especially for people who have had some traumatic backgrounds, some people may find some real potential for healing in sexual exploration and rough sex, BDSM. Because if you\u2019re really, like, paying attention to that consent and communication, and you can be in control, and you can feel respected and cared for, and that, you can be vulnerable with what you\u2019re interested in, and somebody responds to you and respects, you know, your boundaries around that, what a healing experience that can be, whether it\u2019s just kissing and cuddling or whether it involves, like, a whole range of diverse sexual behaviors. So communication is a really important part for people who are thinking about getting into this space."},{"author":"Chase ","text":"[CLIP: demonstrates whipping in Intro to Whips: \u201cI go hard.
