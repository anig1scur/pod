In vitro fertilization offers a path to pregnancy for people fortunate enough to be able to access it. But predicting the success of an implanted embryo is hard. Now researchers are developing a test that could make it easier. [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"For many people, deciding to have a child, getting pregnant, and giving birth is straightforward\u2014if not easy. But for others, it can be a real struggle, sometimes involving years of treatment and no guarantee of success."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"In vitro fertilization, or IVF, is the process of stimulating eggs to develop, fertilizing those eggs outside the body in a lab dish, and implanting them into the womb. There, an embryo hopefully develops into a healthy baby."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right. But for many couples, it\u2019s not that simple. IVF can require multiple rounds of grueling egg stimulation cycles, during which the female partner must undergo daily injections of hormones that make the ovaries grow dozens of eggs at a time. These hormones can produce nausea and other unpleasant effects."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Then, the patient must undergo what\u2019s called a retrieval. That\u2019s outpatient surgery, when a doctor retrieves the eggs, which are then fertilized in the lab. The lab tries to grow them for five or six days, but some don\u2019t grow."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Some people will get the embryos\u2014if there are any\u2014tested for chromosomal or genetic abnormalities. Finally, one or more embryos are transferred into the uterus. It\u2019s like a Hunger Games tournament. You start out with a bunch of eggs. Only a fraction of those get fertilized. Only a subset will survive to day five or six. An even smaller number will be genetically normal. And only some of those normal embryos will implant in the uterus and develop into a healthy baby."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"The whole process is very expensive and time-consuming. For a want-to-be parent, it\u2019s\u00a0 a lot to go through."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It is!And for many people, there is the added stress of not knowing if it will ever be successful."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah. I\u2019ve heard that only about 20 to 40 percent of IVF cycles in people under 40 will result in a live birth."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s right."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Is there a more straightforward method? A better way to choose embryos that have a high chance of developing into healthy babies?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Well actually, researchers at the University of California, San Diego have developed a test for genetic material in the leftover media\u2014the soup of nutrients used to grow the embryos. This genetic material could possibly be used to predict the quality of an embryo\u2014which in turn tells you something about its likelihood of developing successfully."},{"author":"Irene Su","text":"One of the biggest barriers to IVF success is that not every egg, not every sperm, not every embryo will lead to a healthy baby. Individuals and couples go through a lot when they go through IVF, and we are on the hunt for the best way to identify embryos that will lead us to healthy live births."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s Irene Su, a reproductive endocrinologist and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego."},{"author":"Su","text":"So, currently, the way that we evaluate embryos is by how pretty they look, or specifically, morphology\u2014their characteristics of how an embryo looks at every stage. Or by taking five to 10 cells from the blastocyst embryo. And that's an embryo that's usually between 50 to 100 cells to look at the number of chromosomes."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The embryo\u2019s \u201cprettiness\u201d or morphology gives you some idea of how likely it is to develop normally. But many embryos\u2014sometimes as many as half or more\u2014have the wrong number of chromosomes, a condition known as aneuploidy. And many of those will fail to implant in the uterus or develop normally."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So right now, the only way to know if an embryo is healthy is to look at its structure or to do genetic testing, which is an invasive and expensive technique that can take weeks or months."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Exactly. Normally, when an embryo created using IVF is grown in the lab before it is ready to be transferred to the uterus, the culture media is discarded. But Su and her colleague Sheng Zhong wondered if they could use that discarded media to detect genetic material that is released from embryos, called exRNA."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"What is exRNA, and how does it end up in the embryo culture media?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It\u2019s a form of genetic material, or RNA, that cells excrete. Scientists aren\u2019t sure what it\u2019s for but suspect it is involved in cell-to-cell communication and regulation."},{"author":"Zhong","text":"My name is Sheng Zhong. I'm a professor of bioengineering at the University of California San Diego. The understanding of how a single cell zygote becomes a multicelled organism with different cells carrying out vastly different functions is a central question in modern biology."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"You can study embryo development in lab animals, but those findings don\u2019t always translate to humans. And you can\u2019t just dissect a developing human embryo to see what\u2019s going on, which genes are being turned on, etc."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right. So Su and Zhang have come up with a technology called \u201cSILVERseq\u201d to detect these exRNAs from a very small volume of liquid."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So basically, you can get all this genetic information about the developing embryo without even touching it?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s completely noninvasive. The researchers detected about 4,000 different exRNA molecules for each of five different stages of embryo development. They used the data to train an AI model that could predict the embryo\u2019s quality. And it actually worked as well as assessments by human embryologists."},{"author":"Zhang","text":"It turned out that using approximately on the order of 50 to 100 genes, the AI model that was trained on those embryos could very well predict the morphology based quality."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The hope is that you could look at the exRNA profile of an embryo and determine whether it will turn into a healthy baby."},{"author":"Su","text":"And we are not there yet. But we do know that the embryos that continue to grow, they on average will have more exRNA than the embryos that stop growing. We know that the exRNA profiles of embryos that ultimately morphologically look better\u2014meaning hopefully they're more competent to become healthy babies\u2014they have a different profile than the RNA profiles of embryos that look morphologically less good."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Of course, this is still an experimental technique. There are a number of steps required before this could be adapted for widespread use in IVF clinics."},{"author":"Su","text":"I think it's really important that technology is evaluated in evidence space before we push it out into clinical care. \u2026 if this exRNA profile turns out to be something that is so promising, then you\u2019ve got to trial it out to see if patients who have embryos picked by using this versus patients who have used conventional methods, whether this performs better."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Su also made the point that reproductive health and women\u2019s health are often underfunded."},{"author":"Su","text":"And so a lot of whether this type of exciting novel research technology can translate and be applied to human health, early human development, reproductive health depends on how much we as a country value this type of science and value its impact on health and are willing to invest in it.
