This is part one of a four-part Fascination on the science of pleasure. In this series, we\u2019re asking what we can learn from those with marginalized experiences to get to the bottom of BDSM, find the female orgasm and illuminate asexuality. In this episode, we\u2019ll discuss new ways to question your sexuality, according to science that draws from feminism and queer theory. But first, let\u2019s get real basic."},{"author":"Stacy Watnick","text":"Tell me, when I say the word sex or sexuality to you, what comes up?"},{"author":"McDonough","text":"That\u2019s Stacy Watnick, a clinical psychologist based in San Diego, California. She specializes in relationship issues and sexuality. She\u2019s noticed certain patterns in her clients when she asks this question."},{"author":"Watnick","text":"First, surprise\u2014that there\u2019s such a range of experiences in their body and in their mind about it.... Frequently, I get some shame and discomfort. They\u2019re not sure what words they\u2019re supposed to use: \u201cAre those bad words?\u201d A little lean forward\u2026. they\u2019re sort of excited and there\u2019s some tension in wanting to tell me\u2014or a little lean back because they\u2019re not sure it\u2019s safe."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Stacy asks her clients if they\u2019ve heard of gender and orientation. They talk about the words they know. And then she brings up the zine. Zine is short for \u201cmagazine.\u201d But zines are different from traditional magazines. They tend to be self-published and not typically what you\u2019d find in an academic setting. This particular zine invites readers on a \u201cjourney through the landscape of your sexuality.\u201d The front cover features a drawing of five people on a path leading into the horizon."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Each is holding a map labeled \u201cSCT.\u201d SCT stands for sexual configurations theory, a term coined by Sari van Anders, a gender, sex and sexuality researcher at Queen\u2019s University in Ontario."},{"author":"Sari van Anders: ","text":"I was doing some work about multipartnering and things like polyamory..., I was at a conference where there was ... a session about asexuality.... And I started thinking about the way these two ... identities claimed by different people might come together."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Here\u2019s Sari, the creator of this theory. She and her team created the zine as a more accessible offshoot of her 2015 academic paper on the topic."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"It was the most exciting piece of work I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve never really done work where it just felt like it had to come out, and it was sort of bubbling out of me. I think we can maximize our pleasure when we understand what it is that we\u2019re wanting, what the options are, who we are. We can think through some things that we might never have had prompts to do before."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Oxford Languages defines sexual orientation as \u201ca person\u2019s identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are typically attracted.\u201d Sexual configurations theory asks: What if this sort of definition is incomplete? Sari\u2019s theory basically complicates the idea that sexual orientation is only based on gender. She built it on the existing academic literature and on what people shared about their sexualities."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"And it was really important to me to include not just diverse sexualities and genders and people with diverse sexualities and genders but people with marginalized experiences, and so on ..."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Such as people who are LGBTQ+, disabled, into kink or BDSM, asexual or non-monogamous."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"Our science, in some ways, is, if anything, sort of, like, catching up with people's existences.... I think many women know that, like, not all women who are attracted to men, maybe including themselves, that means they\u2019re attracted to, like, penises or that\u2019s the thing only that turns them on."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"And, and so there\u2019s sort of an assumption that gender/sex sexuality, or what people typically call sexual orientation, is about, like, genital match-ups, like, \u201cI have these genitals, and I\u2019m attracted to people who have those genitals.\u201d But really, like, we rarely see people\u2019s genitals until we\u2019ve already decided we\u2019re attracted to them, right.... Usually there\u2019s so much else going on."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Sari uses the term \u201cgender/sex\u201d to mean features that are both socialized and biological and considers it to be just one aspect of sexual orientation."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"You know, it\u2019s not always bodies; there\u2019s also ways of being in the world or clothes, appearance, presentation, the way people talk, how someone treats you. And research on attraction is pretty clear that a lot of other things are rated pretty high up, like kindness or sense of humor or things like that."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Sari refers to this as \u201csexual parameter n\u201d\u2014all the other things that make us attracted to a person. The way she visualizes these aspects is through cone-shaped diagrams where people can pinpoint their preferences."},{"author":"Aki Gormezano","text":"As an example, you could think about the tornado for gender/sex sexuality\u2026. So there\u2019s a space on top where there\u2019s a ring going around the outside that SCT calls the binary ring."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"This is Aki Gormezano, a sexuality researcher who did his Ph.D. with Sari at Queen\u2019s. The ring he\u2019s describing represents what most people know as the sexuality spectrum."},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"And then there\u2019s a whole space beyond that, falling inside of the binary ring, completing that circle, where you\u2019re not just thinking about women and men, you\u2019re thinking about gender/sex-diverse folks who are occupying spaces outside of that binary ring."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"This is called the \u201cchallenge area.\u201d"},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"That circle I described is on the top, but then it moves all the way down to a point forming what kind of looks like a cone. And there\u2019s a little meter ranging from zero to 100 on the far left of that, and that\u2019s to indicate the strength of your attractions."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"In lay terms, if gender/sex was an important part of your attraction to people, you\u2019d mark a place higher up on the tornado. If it wasn\u2019t, you\u2019d mark a place farther down. There are also tornadoes for partner number\u2014one, multiple or none\u2014as well as for sexual parametern, representing the other factors Sari mentioned, such as kindness and sense of humor."},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"Growing up, I was, like, pretty uncritical of my sexuality for the most part\u2026 Like I identified as straight by default. And a lot of my attractions, you know, as a cis boy at the time, or, like, now a cis man, were to cis women."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"In case you don\u2019t know, \u201ccis\u201d here refers to cisgender, when a person\u2019s gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth."},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"I had a point in high school where I realized ... I did have attractions to people who were not cis girls or cis women.... I think I was just, like, confused and upset and didn\u2019t really feel like it was something I could talk about. You know, especially as someone who played sports and was known as an athlete, where that was a big piece of my identity\u2014like, I played soccer all the way through and still do...."},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"I think, for me, the hardest part about realizing that I had interests and attractions that didn\u2019t fit with being straight was that it challenged a lot of my identity around being a man or, like, wanting to be."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Aki says that studying sexuality as an adult has helped him see that this isn\u2019t a problem and that sexual orientation, identity and status don\u2019t necessarily line up perfectly. Sexual configurations theory calls this \u201cbranched.\u201d"},{"author":"Van Anders","text":"Orientations have to do with, like, attractions, interests, arousals, desire [and] pleasure, and those might be different, or they might be the same. Like, you might really enjoy the thoughts or have fantasies about being with a man. And then when it comes to the actual sex you do, you find people of any gender are really enjoyable.... And status refers to, like, what you\u2019re kind of actually doing, have done or will do..., who you\u2019re actually with, for example."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"In a 27-country survey conducted by the market research company Ipsos in 2021, for example, 80 percent of self-identified heterosexual people reported that they were only attracted to the opposite sex, and 12 percent of them said they mostly were. Meanwhile 60 percent of self-identified lesbian and gay people said they were only attracted to the same sex, and 24 percent of them said they mostly were. These \u201cbranches\u201d of sexuality can all be mapped on separate \u201ctornado\u201d diagrams. If you\u2019re still struggling to picture them, you\u2019re not alone."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Between gender/sex, partner number, and other factors\u2014plus identity, orientation and status\u2014it\u2019s a lot. But portraying sexuality as complex is also kind of the point."},{"author":"McDonough ","text":"(tape): To what extent do you think sexuality labels are limiting or expanding? If you could imagine your ideal world of how people conceive of sexuality, would everyone have a label?"},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"I think when you just have identities and you just have labels, especially when identities and labels are really narrow..., you might not have the language to articulate the ways in which you don\u2019t perfectly fit with that identity or label.... And I think the more people ..."},{"author":"Gormezano","text":"who are able to understand the ways in which they might branch from their label or, like, perfectly coincide with it, the more open everyone will be around, you know, just like understanding that, like, around each identity is, like, a collection of people who might vary from that in different kinds of ways."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Stacy, the therapist we heard from earlier, commonly meets clients who are working through their sexualities."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"(tape): How do you help them kind of figure that out?"},{"author":"Watnick","text":"We kind of try labels on like clothes.... I\u2019m gonna try this sort of sweater on and see: Does that feel snuggly? Do I feel comfortable? Is there, like, a resonance in my body and in my mind and my heart and my genitals, all over me, that this feels true...? And much like the sweater I put on, I don\u2019t have to wear it all the time.... There\u2019s a very flexible return policy on this kind of content: if they decide they don\u2019t want it; they don\u2019t have to keep it. But we\u2019re trying it on."},{"author":"Watnick","text":"Let\u2019s see how it feels."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Stacy first saw Sari speak at a virtual conference during the pandemic."},{"author":"Watnick","text":"And my whole brain lit up."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"The two of them have since formed a working group to bring sexual configurations theory into more clinical settings."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"Those of us with marginalized or minoritized or oppressed genders, sexes or sexualities are often not given the tools from science or scholarship to make sense of ourselves. And so this can be helpful in that way. But also people who are majorities..., our culture tells everyone..., you\u2019re just a cisgender man; that\u2019s that; there\u2019s nothing more complex; the complexity is for, you know, the other \u201ccomplicated,\u201d quote, unquote, people. But our research finds that the majorities actually have a lot of complexity and often have had even less prompt to think about it."},{"author":"McDonough ","text":"(tape): I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve had any pushback from the scientific community or otherwise?"},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"We get a fair bit of skepticism from academics that what people might call laypeople, just you, people on the street, could actually do SCT diagrams because they are a bit more complex than \u201cWhat is your attraction...?\u201d.... So we sometimes get people who say, \u201cThis is pretty hard\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m kind of confused.\u201d And then we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, can you describe yourself?\u201d And then we look at the dot, and it matches. So people are actually able to do it anyway."},{"author":"Van Anders: ","text":"And we sometimes get pushback, too, from majorities who get, like, a little bit angry, who are like, \u201cOkay, well, here, I can locate myself, but, like, I don\u2019t believe in all these other locations....\u201d You know, they\u2019re usually seeing questions that have heterosexual first if there\u2019s a checklist. And here it\u2019s, like, you know, if you\u2019re interested in women, that\u2019s just one little dot in this whole diagram, and that can be a bit disorienting for people who are used to being with the center."},{"author":"McDonough","text":"Sari thinks that accounting for this complexity is not only helpful for individuals but also for future scientific research."},{"author":"Van Anders","text":"People sometimes forget that every measure we use is sort of telling a story about what the world is.... They\u2019re kind of almost like a sieve that you sieve the world through. And depending on what that sieve looks like\u2014whether it\u2019s SCT, whether it\u2019s a one-word question with a checkbox or answer or something\u2014is going to let kind of different kinds of things through.... What is empirical in science is to try to measure the world as it is.
