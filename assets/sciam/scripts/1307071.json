Jungle plots will be flooded with extra carbon dioxide, and researchers will monitor what happens. Baseline data will be essential for interpreting the results. I\u2019m Daniel Grossman, and this is Science, Quickly. [CLIP: Theme music] This is the last of three episodes about a radical, decades-in-the-making experiment to understand whether the greenhouse gas protection detail the Amazon gives humankind might retire soon. In the first two episodes I explained why it\u2019s so important to conduct this fanciful experiment and how the specialized gear needed to pull it off was assembled in the middle of the rain forest. If you haven\u2019t listened to the earlier episodes, here\u2019s a quick recap. The main goal of the AmazonFACE experiment is really very simple, says Beto Quesada, one of the project\u2019s leaders."

      "text": "Every year the forest absorbs more than a billion tons of CO2, slowing global warming. Beto, who is an ecologist at Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Amazonian Research, adds that if more CO2 gives the Amazon an edge, the forest of the future could thrive rather than wilting away from too much heat and too little water. Whether it thrives or wilts could make a big difference in how much the planet warms in the coming decades. And that gets us to this episode. Many scientists fear the experiment will show that extra CO2 in the atmosphere is unlikely to give the forest the hoped-for advantage. Richard Betts, one of the experiment\u2019s scientific advisers, worries that the computer models used to forecast future warming might be based on overly optimistic assumptions about the forest\u2019s resilience."

      "text": "Richard worries that the models might be programmed with unrealistic assumptions about how much of an advantage more CO2 might give the forest. Richard Norby, another scientific adviser, says the question of how the Amazon will respond to more CO2 has been studied in carbon fertilization experiments in labs, greenhouses and small chambers that look like roofless greenhouses. Seedlings and small trees have been fed extra CO2 in these experiments, but such conditions might fail to produce the response of an actual tropical forest. To know for sure how a forest will behave with extra CO2, researchers need to run fertilization experiments, such as AmazonFACE, that are believed to give the best results. Carbon fertilization experiments have never been done among towering tropical trees like those in the Amazon."

      "text": "One part of an ecosystem that it definitely makes more sense to study in a real forest is the soil. Richard, a leading expert on carbon fertilization, says that although greenhouse plants grow better with more CO2, Amazon jungle might not because of the lack of phosphorus in much of its soil. He says that experiments in the lab to test this are too artificial to get good results even if you bring in a load of jungle soil. To really understand how this works, you need field experiments in actual forests. [CLIP: Faint forest sounds and bird noises]"

      "text": "Scientists have long known that much of the Amazon\u2019s soil is naturally low in phosphorus. But until recently no one had run an experiment in a jungle plot there to see if this gets in the way of plant growth. At a jungle site roughly 40 miles north of Manaus, Beto and a bevy of collaborators are conducting the first experiment to find out. The research is considered an important complement to AmazonFACE. Raffaello Di Ponzio, a Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, tramps through a thicket of vines and slender trees. He casts handfuls of phosphorus-rich fertilizer pellets onto the ground. [CLIP: Sound of rustling bags and hand spreading of fertilizer]"

I keep an eye on the boundaries, toss, and then when I see the leaves moving, I know the fertilizer\u2019s been distributed there."

      "author": "Grossman",
      "text": "Since 2017 Raffaello, who manages this experiment, and several of his colleagues have spread fertilizer in 32 plots, each about half the size of a football field. The experiment relies on a concept pioneered in the 19th century for improving crop productivity. Plants need many inputs, such as sun, water, carbon dioxide and various nutrients. Researchers believe that for any given combination of inputs available to a forest, at least one of them hinders growth\u2014that\u2019s called a limiting factor. To test if an input\u2014say, for instance, the phosphorus content of a forest\u2019s soil\u2014is a limiting factor, you simply provide more of it and watch if plants grow better. Recently Beto\u2019s international team published two years of results. Compared with control plots, phosphorus-fertilized jungle grew substantially better. Beto is one of six principal investigators for the experiment and oversees its operations. He says the results are clear."

      "text": "The jungle has been contending with phosphorus issues for millennia. [CLIP: \u201cLet There Be Rain,\u201d by Silver Maple] Most of the phosphorus in the Amazon originated in the bedrock of surrounding regions. For millions of years mountains and other elevated areas there rose up and then were eroded by rain and wind. Elements such as phosphorus were then blown and washed down to their current locations. Most of the phosphorus subsequently became bound up in chemically inaccessible forms or got rinsed out of the soil in countless rainstorms, and very little is being added anymore. Plant researchers have known all this for decades. But this experiment is the best scientific evidence yet that phosphorus could be the forest\u2019s limiting factor. And that means that in the future, the forest would likely be influenced by two diametrically opposing forces. On the one hand, higher temperatures combined with more carbon dioxide would accelerate the process of photosynthesis that powers plant growth. On the other hand, phosphorus limitation would apply the brakes. And Richard Norby\u2019s hunch is that the brakes would win out. Richard is the CO2 fertilization expert we met earlier."

      "text": "If he\u2019s right, phosphorus limitation will prevent carbon dioxide from helping the forest grow better, meaning increased CO2 in the atmosphere will not save the Amazon from global warming. But he also says his hunch could be wrong\u2014the jungle might have a trick up its sleeve."
    },
    {
      "author": "Norby",
      "text": "On the other hand, there are mechanisms that we can easily propose whereby elevated CO2 would alleviate some of that phosphorus limitation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Grossman",
      "text": "What are those mechanisms? Scientists have proposed that trees exposed to more CO2 could somehow acquire untapped phosphorus in the soil and overcome current phosphorus limitations. Perhaps some trees would produce roots that could mine phosphorus from deeper soil or stimulate microbial activity that could make the otherwise chemically inaccessible phosphorus compounds available. The AmazonFACE researchers will watch for these and other possible responses to additional CO2. In that way, they\u2019ll learn how the forest works and make predictions about how it will behave in the future, Beto says."

But that would be a fool\u2019s errand, Beto says, because they can\u2019t be sure what the conditions will be in 2050. It\u2019s actually what we all want to know."
