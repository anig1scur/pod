The work appears in the journal Behavioral Processes."},{"author":"Hitomi Chijiiwa","text":"Our aim was to test whether dogs are sensitive to humans\u2019 competence levels. And whether they evaluate humans on this trait."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Hitomi Chijiiwa is an assistant professor at Osaka University. If critiquing people\u2019s proficiency seems an odd job for a pup, it may not be all that far fetched.

Particularly if those skills might come in handy for our four-footed little friends. So they set up a simple experiment."},{"author":"Chijiiwa","text":"We showed 60 dogs two persons manipulating transparent containers.

The actors repeated the performance on a second container, with the same results: the competent person succeeded, the other, not so much. Then the researchers handed both actors a third container. In some trials, this container was empty. In others, it contained a treat. And what they found was that female dogs spent more time gazing expectantly at the person who had previously demonstrated container-opening know-how."},{"author":"Chijiiwa","text":"And they were more likely to approach the competent person."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"But only when they thought they might get free food."},{"author":"Chijiiwa","text":"Dogs in the empty condition showed no preferences."},{"author":"Hopkin: ","text":"(Although one little cutie with a bow on her head did bark at all the containers, regardless of their contents.)
