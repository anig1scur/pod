We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research and help you understand what it really means."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And we\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors. On the docket today, a court imperils Biden\u2019s big workplace vaccination mandate...,"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"... booster shot eligibility expands, as does evidence the shots help ..."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"... and zoo tigers and leopards get COVID and their own vaccine. In early November\u00a0the Biden administration laid out a rule to get most American workers vaccinated\u00a0because unvaccinated people were filling up hospitals. You\u2019ve been tracking the backlash, so what\u2019s the latest?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"This hasn\u2019t been a good seven days for the White House plan to get millions more Americans vaccinated by January. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, at President Biden\u2019s direction, had announced an emergency rule: companies with more than 100 employees need those workers either to be vaccinated by January 4\u00a0or get weekly COVID tests. That prompted a number of states and companies to sue the administration in the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative courts in the country. Conservative courts generally do not favor government interventions."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And the Fifth Circuit held true to that philosophy last Friday, ordering OSHA to stop the rule, pending resolution of these cases in a full court hearing. The court gave a lot of weight to economic issues, noting mandates could cause disruptions if workers quit instead of getting vaccinated. And it scolded the administration for infringing on the rights of individuals to make personal medical decisions."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"It also noted that while OSHA has authority to issue emergency rules based on the physical safety of the workplace, such as demanding the removal of asbestos, an airborne virus is not confined to the workplace and therefore may not fall under OSHA authority.\u00a0\u00a0 Mostly absent from the court decision was a consideration of health concerns, which is what prompted the emergency rule in the first place. The administration had argued the virus is spread in group settings such as workplaces. Data show the spreaders have almost all been unvaccinated people."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And vaccinations in the workforce would save thousands of lives. This is not an idle notion. Remember the COVID outbreaks at meat-processing plants? An analysis published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences at the end of 2020 found that, in the first six months of that year, meat plant outbreaks caused between 4,300 and 5,200 deaths, and the fatalities started in the plants and spread through\u00a0surrounding communities. As for economic consequences and quitting workers, United Airlines and Tyson Foods, which started vaccine mandates for employees months ago, report that fewer than 5 percent have quit."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Major business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce endorsed mandates because they keep businesses open. Three big labor unions brought suits against the administration asking for stronger mandates. And Gartner, a business consulting firm, did a survey of 300 companies this week and reported that 60 percent plan to keep moving forward with vaccine mandates. That\u2019s because the Fifth Circuit decision was just a temporary stay. The federal courts have consolidated all the lawsuits and, after a random lottery, sent the whole bunch to the Sixth appellate circuit, another court that has a lot of conservative judges."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That ideology could spell trouble for the OSHA rule again. The Sixth Circuit will hear a full case and issue a ruling. But that won\u2019t be the end of things, either. Whichever side loses will appeal. And the case will end up in the Supreme Court, perhaps in three or four months. The high court has supported several vaccine mandates recently. Several legal scholars have argued that a vaccine mandate in the workplace is within OSHA\u2019s statutory authority."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But the court does have a conservative majority, so we really won\u2019t know what happens until they actually get a case and make a decision. We talk a lot about boosters on this podcast, but it seems there\u2019s always more to say. What\u2019s the latest on who\u2019s eligible for a booster? And should you get one?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The science of booster shots is a moving target. President Biden announced plans in August for all Americans to be eligible for boosters. But at first, many experts pushed back and said they weren\u2019t needed for most people. Then\u00a0they said they were needed for older adults and people with underlying health conditions or work exposures that could put them at greater risk of getting severe COVID. And now\u00a0the FDA just authorized Pfizer and Moderna boosters for anyone 18 and over who is at least six months out from their second shot."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Anyone who had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is already eligible for a booster at least two months after their shot. The CDC\u2019s advisory panel is set to meet Friday to discuss whether to recommend boosters for all adults. But some states and cities have not waited. California, Colorado, New Mexico\u00a0and New York City have already opened up boosters to any adult who wants one. Evidence has been building that the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness wanes over time\u00a0and not just in older people."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Data from Israel showed the Pfizer vaccine was just 41 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease as of July. A study in England found the Pfizer vaccine was 70 percent effective after five months. And a study of veterans in the U.S. found that from February to October, vaccine effectiveness declined to 58 percent for Moderna, 43 percent for Pfizer, and Johnson and Johnson was the lowest, at just 13 percent. The vaccines still protect well against hospitalization and death, but that protection is starting to decline among the elderly."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The good news is: boosters appear to be very effective at increasing immunity. A study in the U.K. of people over 50 and those with underlying health conditions found that those who got the Pfizer vaccine saw their protection increase from about 63 percent to 94percent.\u00a0And people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine saw theirs increase from 44 percent to 93 percent. Even though the original vaccine series provides good protection against disease, boosters can extend that\u2014and keep you from getting\u00a0long COVID."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So\u00a0even if you\u2019re not older or high-risk, getting a booster is probably a good idea, especially ahead of the winter holidays as more people gather indoors."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Does it matter which booster you get?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s a good question. The FDA has said you can get a booster of any vaccine, regardless of what you originally got. While all of the vaccines have been shown to boost antibody levels after vaccination, there are some differences. The NIH did a study in which they mixed and matched different vaccines and boosters\u00a0and found that people who got the Moderna vaccine and Moderna booster had the highest levels of antibodies, followed by people who had Pfizer and a Moderna booster or Moderna and a Pfizer booster."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"In all cases, having an mRNA booster was better than a Johnson & Johnson one. Other studies have also shown a slight edge for the Moderna shot over Pfizer. One possible explanation is that Moderna contains more than twice the amount of mRNA as the Pfizer vaccine. But there\u2019s a catch: the NIH study looked at a full-dose Moderna booster, whereas the currently approved Moderna booster is a half dose. So\u00a0while it\u2019s possible a Moderna booster may be slightly better than a Pfizer one, either vaccine will likely give you strong protection against COVID."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The best booster may simply be whichever one you can get.\u00a0 Finally, the pandemic isn\u2019t limited to human beings. It\u2019s impacted a few animals in zoos as well."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Cats\u2014the big ones at zoos\u2014aren\u2019t immune from COVID. Sadly last week a children\u2019s zoo in Lincoln, Neb., reported that three snow leopards died from the disease\u00a0about a month after they showed symptoms.\u00a0Their names were Ranney, Everest and Makalu. Two tigers that also got infected are recovering. There have been outbreaks at other zoos, too. Two lions and other big cats at the Saint\u00a0Louis Zoo tested positive early this month. All are getting better. It\u2019s a puzzle how the cats got sick\u00a0since the Lincoln zoo says keepers were masked."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"People can pass the virus to animals, the CDC says. But if you have pets, relax. Pets don\u2019t give the virus back to people, two veterinary studies done this summer showed. And pets themselves usually have very mild symptoms. At zoos, animals may get their own vaccine. Zoetis, a veterinary health care company, has developed a shot using a modified coronavirus spike protein. Company data show it stimulates a good antibody response. So Zoetis has donated 11,000 doses to zoos all across the U.S."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Now you\u2019re up to speed.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, at President Biden\u2019s direction, had announced an emergency rule: companies with more than 100 employees need those workers either to be vaccinated by January 4\u00a0or get weekly COVID tests.

The NIH did a study in which they mixed and matched different vaccines and boosters\u00a0and found that people who got the Moderna vaccine and Moderna booster had the highest levels of antibodies, followed by people who had Pfizer and a Moderna booster or Moderna and a Pfizer booster."]},{"begin":"476.720","end":"508.600","lines":["In all cases, having an mRNA booster was better than a Johnson & Johnson one. Other studies have also shown a slight edge for the Moderna shot over Pfizer. One possible explanation is that Moderna contains more than twice the amount of mRNA as the Pfizer vaccine. But there\u2019s a catch: the NIH study looked at a full-dose Moderna booster, whereas the currently approved Moderna booster is a half dose. So\u00a0while it\u2019s possible a Moderna booster may be slightly better than a Pfizer one, either vaccine will likely give you strong protection against COVID."]},{"begin":"508.600","end":"520.760","lines":["The best booster may simply be whichever one you can get.\u00a0 Finally, the pandemic isn\u2019t limited to human beings.

Sadly last week a children\u2019s zoo in Lincoln, Neb., reported that three snow leopards died from the disease\u00a0about a month after they showed symptoms.\u00a0Their names were Ranney, Everest and Makalu. Two tigers that also got infected are recovering. There have been outbreaks at other zoos, too. Two lions and other big cats at the Saint\u00a0Louis Zoo tested positive early this month.

But if you have pets, relax. Pets don\u2019t give the virus back to people, two veterinary studies done this summer showed. And pets themselves usually have very mild symptoms. At zoos, animals may get their own vaccine. Zoetis, a veterinary health care company, has developed a shot using a modified coronavirus spike protein. Company data show it stimulates a good antibody response. So Zoetis has donated 11,000 doses to zoos all across the U.S."]},{"begin":"591.560","end":"594.280","lines":["Now you\u2019re up to speed.
