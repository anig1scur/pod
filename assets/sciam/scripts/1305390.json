On today\u2019s show, we\u2019re talking about how the stuff that goes on in your brain is connected to symptoms in your gut. Scientists have found molecular pathways that trigger inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups. And those paths start in the brain, triggered by stress. This raises the possibility of a new type of treatment.

I was feeling a bit off, but drinking ginger ale really helped settle my stomach. Did your antacid tablets end up helping?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah they did. But neither of us was really sick. I mean, we both showed up at work, after all."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, I mean, speak for yourself\u2014I wasn\u2019t feeling great. But I definitely wasn\u2019t extremely ill."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"There is another kind of gastrointestinal illness, though, that\u2019s in a whole different league. It\u2019s inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. That\u2019s bouts of disabling pain, bleeding, weight loss, diarrhea and hospitalizations that sometimes require surgery."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That really doesn\u2019t sound like fun. I actually know some people with IBD. Is it a super common illness?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Unfortunately, it is. About 3 million adults in the U.S. have it."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019ve heard of Crohn\u2019s disease, which can be pretty disabling. Isn\u2019t that a type of IBD?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, it is. The other type is called ulcerative colitiis."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Oh, I\u2019ve heard of that one too. I think it mainly affects the large intestine."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And Crohn\u2019s often damages the small intestine, although it can hurt other parts of the GI tract as well. What makes them both IBD is inflammation. IBD is often linked to an overactive immune system, where the body\u2019s own immune cells attack the digestive tract. And it may have a genetic component.\u00a0"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that Crohn\u2019s is more common among people with a family history of it. But are there any effective treatments?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s usually some variety of immune suppressant such as a steroid drug or a medication that soothes inflammation. But even these controlled cases have periodic flare-ups. The causes of these flares have been a real mystery. But I\u2019ve been reading that the reason\u2014or at least one of the main reasons\u2014can be psychological stress."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That does make sense. But it seems a little bit obvious that stress triggers a lot of diseases. So what\u2019s the new thing here?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"It\u2019s the precise connections. Starting in the brain, researchers traced two different pathways, made up of molecules and cells that kind of bang into one another. And the paths led all the way down to the intestines."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So is that kind of like a series of falling dominoes, each one knocking the next one over?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah that\u2019s a good way of thinking of it."},{"author":"Lewis: ","text":"But I just want to be clear: you\u2019re not saying that IBD is all in your head, right?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"No, no. Really no. It\u2019s a biological disease tied to those hyperactive immune cells. But..."},{"author":"Christoph Thaiss","text":"Psychological stress will greatly exacerbate the severity of the disease. So stress by itself is not causing the disease, but it's greatly increasing the magnitude of the disease."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s Christoph Thaiss."},{"author":"Thaiss","text":"I'm an assistant professor of microbiology here at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Thaiss was one of the scientists who traced out the rows of dominoes, as you put it. And his team found that the first domino to fall with IBD patients was some kind of stressful experience."},{"author":"Thaiss","text":"If they had broken up with their partner or lost their jobs or lost someone in the family or any other major event in the lives of these patients ... if someone goes through a very stressful period in their lives, it feels like their disease flaring up, but the physician doesn't see microscopic signs of inflammation yet. But then very often what will happen is a few weeks down the road, then there will be a flare. So there is definitely a very strong component of how the brain or the psychological state of the patient can control inflammatory diseases."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That is really validating, and I can say from personal experience that that intense stress can affect the body. But it sounds kind of anecdotal. I\u2019m guessing Thaiss did some more scientific studies?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Hey, I don\u2019t blame you for a little skepticism. There\u2019s a lot of loose talk about how stress affects the body, and you\u2019re right: Thaiss and his team did go after this more scientifically. First they looked at mice with IBD-like conditions in order to identify the rows of molecular dominoes. Then they verified that these same dominoes fell down in people. The pattern held true in three different groups of IBD patients. They even went so far as to do colonoscopy exams on some of these people, and saw these molecular signs of inflammation after stressful events."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So what\u2019s the next domino after someone has a fight with their spouse, for example?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s the release of glucocorticoids, those are hormones that the brain triggers when you feel threatened. And these hormones reach two different kinds of cells in the gut, with two different effects."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"You mean hormones like cortisol? How does that affect cells in the gut?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Well, first, did you know the gut had its own nervous system?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, I think I did. Isn\u2019t it called the enteric nervous system? I think it has neurons and supporting cells."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So those supporting cells are called glial cells. They do a bunch of different things and one is to signal those hyperactive immune cells, the ones I mentioned earlier, when the body is stressed. Those cells arrive, kind of like an attacking army, and they hit the lining of the intestines. And bingo, you get inflammation and a flare-up of IBD."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And what about the second cell type you mentioned?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Those are the enteric neurons. They control the muscles of the intestines and therefore how quickly or slowly food moves through them. Long exposure to glucocorticoids blocks these neurons from developing fully. They kind of stay in an immature state. And immature neurons aren\u2019t able to make muscles squeeze very hard. So food moves very slowly. And IBD patients feel badly bloated or constipated or crampy. It just makes everything worse.\u00a0"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That sounds really horrible. But if stress leads to IBD flare-ups, could treating the stress help patients?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Thaiss thinks so, although he cautions these are early days. Nobody has rigorously tested interventions like psychotherapy on IBD. But he believes that stress might affect how well other treatments, like drugs, actually work."},{"author":"Thaiss","text":"The treatment response of a patient might very strongly depend on psychological factors, which would mean that we should assess the psychological factors and tailor the treatment accordingly."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So that\u2019s not something doctors already do?"},{"author":"Thaiss","text":"No, it's not a routine practice to basically quantify a patient's level of psychological stress when they're first seen by a physician or when the decision about the treatment is being made. So that's something that we're now following up on."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Thaiss also thinks that psychotherapy itself, including stress management techniques, might help."},{"author":"Thaiss","text":"Stress mitigation strategy, which I think would be potentially even more beneficial than the molecular interventions at the downstream end of the pathway ... it may suggest that we can block this inflammatory pathway altogether by improving a patient's mental state or emotional state."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I guess I finally need to do that mindfulness meditation that I\u2019ve been putting off. But it totally makes sense that treating stress itself could help with physical symptoms. And it seems like a promising place to start. Do you think it\u2019ll work?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Well, I hope it does. Like Thaiss said, they really need to test it. But I do have a gut feeling there may be something to this.
