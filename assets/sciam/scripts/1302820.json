As it happens, tiger sharks have something in common with certain East Coasters."},{"author":"Neil Hammerschlag","text":":\u00a0During the winter, when it\u2019s cold, they snowbird down near the Bahamas and off of Florida. And then, during the summer, they migrate north."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":":\u00a0Neil Hammerschlag\u00a0is director of the Shark Research & Conservation Program at the University of Miami. He and his colleagues analyzed 40 years of fishing catch data\u00a0and found that as ocean waters warm, the sharks\u2019\u00a0range has shifted some 250 miles to the north. The sharks, it seems, are chasing their preferred water temperatures to the north. They also tracked dozens of tiger sharks with satellite tags for nine years\u00a0and found similar results."},{"author":"Hammerschlag","text":":\u00a0So taken together, we have several lines of evidence that tiger shark distributions and migrations are changing from ocean warming, causing their distributions and migrations to expand further north. And in these areas, they occur earlier in the year\u00a0from ocean warming."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":":\u00a0Their findings appear in the journal Global Change Biology. [Neil Hammerschlag et al., Ocean warming alters the distributional range, migratory timing, and spatial protections of an apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)] This shift matters, Hammerschlag says, because tiger sharks are apex predators, and where they go influences the food web beneath them. The sharks are also moving outside marine protected areas\u00a0and into places where they\u2019re more vulnerable to commercial fishing."},{"author":"Hammerschlag","text":":\u00a0What this points to is: these marine protected areas need to consider current but also future changes in species distribution due to ocean warming. And they have to be adaptive and work with not only having marine protected areas\u00a0but also other protections, such as catch limits and other types of more traditional species conservation and management tools, in addition to protecting places."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":":\u00a0Now, if you don\u2019t find the ecological argument convincing, Hammerschlag pointed out one more implication. Although shark bites are relatively rare, he says, if tiger sharks shift their range\u2014and warmer waters draw more bathers to the ocean\u2014that could up the odds of an unfortunate encounter beneath the waves.
