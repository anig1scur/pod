Unfortunately that\u2019s probably a pretty common feeling and not because doctors are trying to be jerks. Like all humans, doctors have unconscious biases that can lead them to make unfair judgment calls. But those biases can pose a serious risk to people\u2019s health."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman, and"},{"author":"","text":"I\u2019m joined today by Dr. Cristina Gonzalez. She\u2019s a professor of medicine and population health and associate director at the Institute for Excellence in Health Equity at NYU Grossman School of Medicine."},{"author":"","text":"Cristina\u2014can I call you Cristina?"},{"author":"Cristina Gonzalez","text":"Yes. Thank you for asking."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thank you so much for joining us today."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Let\u2019s start with a basic question: What is implicit bias?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So implicit bias refers to the unconscious and unintentional mental associations that we make about others, often along lines of personal identity factors like race or religion or gender. But they\u2019re unconscious and unintentional."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"How much does that tend to come up in a clinical setting, and why does it matter?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"It\u2019s more likely to come up when we\u2019re pressed for time; when we\u2019re fatigued; probably when we\u2019re hungry, although that doesn\u2019t exist in the literature, to my knowledge, anyway; when we\u2019re not really knowing the person in front of us very well and we may have incomplete data\u2014honestly kind of every day at work, right, at different times of the day, different time pressures, etcetera."},{"author":"","text":"And the reason why it matters is because it can actually influence our communication behaviors with patients. And so I wanna be clear that implicit bias isn\u2019t, like, a moral indictment. It\u2019s a coincidence of our lived experiences, how our unconscious mental associations go, but because it can influence our behaviors, we wanna\u2014we work on that in, in our lab."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What do we know about how implicit bias in a clinical setting can impact patients?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"How do you know when implicit bias has impacted the encounter, right? I know it\u2019s because the vibe\u2014I and others\u2014that the vibe has changed, the nonverbals have changed, the patient may get a little more curt in their answers or shorter, you know?"},{"author":"","text":"And we do this in real life. And I keep getting people who say, \u201cHow do we, how do we teach that?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"And, and I keep consulting other people. I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do you teach it? Like, I don\u2019t know.\u201d [Laughs] And so I think we could talk about that as a challenge in case anybody writes in and gives us the answer [laughs]. I would love it so much."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, maybe, maybe there\u2019s, like, a, a body language coach out there ..."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Yes!"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"An acting or movement coach who thinks about micro facial expressions. Like, somebody\u2019s, somebody\u2019s gotta be able to help with that."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Yes\u2014yes, yes, yes and yes."},{"author":"","text":"If we stay focused on communication behaviors and communication skills, there\u2019s the concept that\u2019s called verbal dominance, meaning that if we have a 15-minute encounter, and if we are gonna center the conversation on racial bias, then if you have higher unconscious\u2014implicit racial bias, more pro-white as a coincidence of your lived experience, then you\u2019re likely to talk more in those 15 minutes when you\u2019re seeing a Black patient compared to a white patient."},{"author":"","text":"When you\u2019re talking more, that means they\u2019re talking less."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"That means we\u2019re likely to be asking their opinion less; we\u2019re likely to be doing less shared decision-making, meaning getting their input on what the, what the treatment plan is, is it acceptable to them; asking if they have questions. Patients perceive less patient-centeredness. They perceive, in essence, a colder affect or vibe, if you will, in the encounter. And, and we also end up using more words that relay anxiety."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s the way we\u2019re socialized and our unconscious ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Mental associations. So it\u2019s just humans."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. So let\u2019s talk about what you\u2019re doing at your lab. What interventions have you been working on, and what\u2019s been working?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So we\u2019re interventionalists, right? But instead of needles or devices or pills, we use education. So we recognize when implicit bias may have impacted the patient encounter, right? And then we teach people skills to be able to manage that negative influence, negative impact\u2014partner with the patient and then restore rapport, you know, discuss ways of moving forward, etcetera\u2014to be able to have the positive outcomes we wanted in the first place. And so a lot of what we talk about is basic \u201chumaning,\u201d to be quite honest. And so\u2014but people get nervous when it\u2019s something about race or religion or gender or sexual orientation, and people worry."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So if I can take a step back and explain that the\u2014we were the first to study\u2014we weren\u2019t the first to study patient perceptions of bias and discrimination in their encounters, but to our knowledge in the literature, our lab was actually the first to study it and then stop and say, \u201cOkay, great. Not great that it\u2019s happening, but great that we\u2019re talking about it, that you\u2019re talking about it.\u201d And then, \u201cWhat should I teach myself and the medical students?\u201d \u2019Cause at the time it was just\u2014medical students was my audience. And they, they said, \u201cJust apologize.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d [Laughs] They were like, \u201cJust apologize.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh\u2014I can teach that! I can do that,\u201d right?"},{"author":"","text":"And so it, it, of course, evolved from there, but we did a, a focus group study with Black and Hispanic patients in English and Spanish across New York City, across the socioeconomic spectrum, and over and over again they were so generous with us. They said, \u201cWe know you\u2019re human; we don\u2019t need the encounter to be perfect and no bias, etcetera, but once it happens we can\u2019t have it ignored,\u201d \u2019cause that second insult was a real attack on their, like, their, their core, their dignity."},{"author":"","text":"And sometimes we may also\u2014they may also perceive bias\u2014we, too, when we\u2019re patients\u2014we also may perceive bias when actually it\u2019s a routine question ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"But based on our lived experiences, right\u2014being followed around in stores, being accused of wrongdoing, being questioned about our identity, etcetera\u2014we may take it as bias. And that can be hard as a physician or a medical student, being like, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to ask you this.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so we teach skills to step back and depersonalize it so that you can, again, partner, apologize if necessary or explain why and be able to move forward together. But it\u2019s the ignoring part that was really, really hard for patients."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure. Well, and I think a, a lot of folks who are familiar with implicit bias, you know, thanks to a great surge in research over the last few years, they might think that most of the battle is just becoming aware that we all have implicit bias because that\u2019s really revelatory and difficult for a lot of people ..."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But it sounds like that is very much just the first step in actually mitigating it. Would you say that\u2019s right?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Absolutely. And so there\u2019s been a lot of talk in the literature, and in the lay press as well, about awareness being enough, right? Because if we become aware, then our good intentions will prevail. If it were that easy, I would happily be studying something else, right?"},{"author":"","text":"And so I think that, for us, it\u2019s becoming aware, and then\u2014but it\u2019s not fair to have people be aware and then say, \u201cGo be better,\u201d you know, because, of course, they were trying to be their best at the very beginning. And so that\u2019s where the skill comes in."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But what happens when someone is resistant to the idea that this is something they need training for?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"For implicit bias, I think that you have to have safe places to fail. And in the educational literature that\u2019s called a critical incident, and in a critical incident you may practice something and then have that internal aha! moment, and internal aha! moments happen in private\u2013that you get this reaction that you don\u2019t like when your actions don\u2019t match your values. If you could have that privately, right\u2014maybe with a interactive computer case, for example\u2014then you\u2019re more likely to change your actions to match your values. If you have it publicly, you\u2019re actually at risk of changing your values to match your actions \u2019cause you feel the need to save face."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"How do you go about measuring implicit bias in, in a clinical setting? Is there a way for you to see how much work there is to do?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"There are tests, like the Implicit Association Test; it\u2019s a free and publicly available test. There are other tests, and they\u2019re what\u2019s\u2014what are called latency response tests, meaning they see how quickly you react to two opposite concepts\u2014joy, evil; male, female; just thinking about possibilities\u2014down to the millisecond. So see how quickly you react to different concepts. And that is supposed to measure your implicit bias."},{"author":"","text":"They\u2019re interesting, and I don\u2019t use \u2019em diagnostically. They tend to mirror what we would expect in terms of the way we\u2019re socialized. So in the clinical setting, as you were saying, how would you measure it? We made high-fidelity, meaning very realistic, simulations that have the types of stressors you would have in the clinic, so interruptions, a very pleasant but somewhat meandering patient\u2014because they\u2019re not a professional historian, okay ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"They\u2019re telling the story the way it happened to them\u2014and various things in, in the clinic that you would see, in a simulated encounter."},{"author":"","text":"Physicians didn\u2019t know why they were going into it. Standardized patients, I hope, are not watching because they were blinded to [laughs] the purpose of our study and were phenomenal. And so nobody knew what was going on. And so we actually were able to measure the physicians\u2019 racial implicit bias on that Race Implicit Association Test at the end so that they\u2014all the behaviors had already happened and correlate it with communication behaviors."},{"author":"","text":"And so you\u2019ll see it, again, in patient education, establishing rapport, eliciting all a patient\u2019s concerns, active listening\u2014like, \u201cHow\u2019re you doing right now?\u201d\u2014it actually makes a difference in those types of behaviors. And also things like interpersonal distance."},{"author":"","text":"And so that\u2019s something that we can actually monitor. I always tell people, like, you know, \u201cTake\u2014put a, put a coffee mug, and make sure you don\u2019t go behind it.\u201d The patient\u2019s not gonna know why there\u2019s a coffee mug. They were always drinking coffee, right [laughs]?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"But, but that\u2019s a nice little cue for yourself of, like, \u201cOh, let me lean in a little bit and make sure that I\u2019m looking at the person, connecting, making that eye contact, etcetera.\u201d And so it\u2019s in\u2014honestly general communication skills, but it\u2019s different with different patients."},{"author":"","text":"And so we video-record them and then are able to analyze and find the inflection points of where to teach to be our best selves."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What does that teaching and learning process look like for medical professionals?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Some people like to call communication skills \u201csoft skills,\u201d but they\u2019re not\u2014I mean, I love warm and fuzzy, and so\u2014but they\u2019re not, right, \u2019cause that implies that other skills are harder, whereas it\u2019s, it\u2019s very difficult to communicate effectively. And so we call them critical humanism skills."},{"author":"","text":"Last week, actually, with some first-year medical students\u2014they were so good\u2014we practiced role-plays ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Where a student had the role of the physician, the\u2014another student had the role of the patient, and when you had the role of the patient, of course, you\u2019re not gonna be a 19-year-old Black man or a 22-year-old, you know, young woman who identifies as a lesbian if you\u2019re not, but it\u2014we practice perspective-believing, so they don\u2019t see what each other has and the instructions each other has. And I ask them to act very well, [as] if you\u2019re trying to win a Tony Award."},{"author":"","text":"And so they act out the role-plays. And in the\u2014in one of the scenarios, the, the physician asks a routine question, but the\u2014based on the patient\u2019s lived experience, they perceive it as bias. It\u2019s, you know, \u201cDo you smoke cigarettes?\u201d kind of a question to the 19-year-old-young man who hurt his arm playing tennis, right? And they practice what we call verbal procedures, which are verbatim statements of actually apologizing, or acknowledging if you\u2019re not comfortable apologizing, and restoring that rapport."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"They say it to the other student word for word, the other student gives feedback, and then they practice it again. And then they, they articulate it verbatim again, and then the student\u2014and then they decide on a final. But that do-over has been called a \u201cgift.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"The other one, if I may, is a case where it\u2019s a young woman\u2014this actually happened; it\u2019s de-identified, but it actually happened to a young woman\u2014she is on oral contraceptives for endometriosis, which is a painful condition in your uterus. Long story short: low-dose, in essence, birth control pills will help the symptoms."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"And we\u2019re helping her, and she went to a new doctor and asked for this, and they said, \u201cWell, this is better at preventing pregnancy.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t really need it for preventing pregnancy.\u201d And [they\u2019re] like, \u201cWell, no, this is really better.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I only have sex with women.\u201d And the physician\u2019s like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s New York; you never know.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Inhales deeply]"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"And, and I\u2019m sure the physician wasn\u2019t a terrible person. I\u2019m sure she was flustered or who knows, right ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"But, but that\u2014it\u2019s not to vilify the physician at all ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"No, no ..."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"But, but it gives\u2014and I understand your reaction \u2019cause that\u2019s how the patient felt."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Right?She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, no, I actually, I actually do know.\u201d [Laughs] And so, so I\u2014so we don\u2019t make, make the students make the actual biased statement, right, the assumption, but when they role-play it, you can always tell when they get to that part \u2019cause someone\u2019s always like, \u201c[Gasps] I am so sorry I made the assumption.\u201d And, and they are able to practice in a safe space."},{"author":"","text":"But I was talking to a surgeon, and she was making the analogy of building muscle memory. So if you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat would you say?\u201d You\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, I\u2019d, I\u2019d apologize.\u201d \u201cNo, no\u2014what would you actually say?\u201d And people are always like, \u201cHmm.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so you build the muscle memory so that you\u2019ve got those in your clinical skills toolbox, and you\u2019ve already practiced restoring rapport or apologizing when you actually make an assumption, right\u2014either way. And then you\u2019re ready for when\u2014you\u2019re more ready than you would have been when it happens in real life."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"In what ways does our medical system or, you know, the current establishment fuel implicit bias? What needs to change there?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Huh."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I know that\u2019s kind of a big question [laughs]."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"I, I was gonna say, \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d No, but, but\u2014well, so, again, it\u2019s not intentional, right? No one\u2019s in a back room being like, \u201cHeh, heh, heh, we hurt 10 patients today,\u201d right? So I get that. But it\u2014there\u2019s a couple of things. There\u2019s education."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So we end up pathologizing race or pathologizing sexual orientation, meaning, meaning that, like, we\u2019ll say, you know, \u201cRace is\u2014Black race is a risk factor for high blood pressure.\u201d Actually, no, it\u2019s not. Racism is, but race is not. Or we\u2019ll do things like whenever there\u2019s a sexually transmitted infection type of case, it\u2019ll be, you know, a, a gay man. And, and we make these stereotyping cases, which I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s doing intentionally, but you have to intentionally not do it and make sure that, you know, we put different humans in, in all kinds of different cases when people are learning."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So that we don\u2019t reinforce stereotypes. And\u2014because that\u2019ll actually limit our diagnostic abilities later."},{"author":"","text":"The time pressures\u2013appointments are, like, 15 minutes long, sometimes 10 minutes long. The way that people are forced to churn, for lack of a better\u2014terrible word, sorry\u2014through patients because of systemic pressures, right\u2014and it\u2019s not even like your hospital that\u2019s saying that; it\u2019s really just the way the whole system is\u2014makes you have to have these snap judgments."},{"author":"","text":"You know, we were just at a National Academy of Medicine diagnostic equity meeting, and we were talking about, \u201cHow can we make it\u2014a change so that we have more time?\u201d And that way\u2014I think that\u2019d be more cost-effective, right, because you\u2019d be able to actually have time with your patient."},{"author":"","text":"And the last thing I\u2019ll say is that the burnout is, is real, and so it sets us up to make snap judgments because efficiency and what\u2019s called throughput, right, getting patients through, is the pressures that we\u2019re\u2014under which we\u2019re working."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. You know, beyond the obvious individual risks to a patient, how is this impacting health care?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"Think about how implicit bias influences communication skills. And then we think about how\u2014the patient experience, right, patient satisfaction, the patient experience scores, for example, have an influence on reimbursement rates. And really what we want is to help patients have a better experience, right? But if we can get that system-wide driver to say, \u201cOoh, and it\u2019ll help your reimbursement,\u201d maybe we could get some buy-in."},{"author":"","text":"On the missed\u2014misdiagnosis and thinking about making assumptions about patients, not believing patients, there\u2019s a concept of testimonial injustice, meaning that you\u2019re less likely to be believed for what you\u2019re actually saying if you\u2019re, you know, a woman, if you\u2019re of a minoritized race or, or ethnic background. So if you don\u2019t believe the patient or you kind of dismiss them\u2014there\u2019s lots of literature in them for women, right\u2014and then you end up having delayed diagnosis, all those costs to the person and to the system could be avoided."},{"author":"","text":"Addressing implicit bias isn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not trying to make it a\u2014paint it as a cure-all, right ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"It\u2019s a\u2014health equity and health disparities is a very what\u2019s called a wicked problem, right?

I\u2019m ready."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"How do you want medical schools and hospitals to be thinking about implicit bias?"},{"author":"Gonzalez","text":"So I want this to be just like anything else. When students and, and residents get the wrong diagnosis, we help them get the right diagnosis. Even when we get the wrong diagnosis, we work on getting the right diagnosis. I want this to be just like any other clinical skills \u2026that we could have what we have now, which\u2014analogous to what I call, I should make it more gender-inclusive, but it\u2019s\u2014we call it the \u201cI got a guy\u201d consult.
