    "The scientists found several previously hidden galaxies\u00a0that date back to 13 billion years ago\u2014and many more might be missing from our current census of the early universe."

But there is one way around that: Astronomers can observe the sky with longer wavelengths\u2014using telescopes like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile, or ALMA.\u00a0 With ALMA, astronomers can see even the dust bunnies hiding up in the sky\u2014because as the dust absorbs photons from the stars behind it, it heats up."

Fudamoto et al., Normal, dust-obscured galaxies in the epoch of reionization] Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is set to sail off the planet later this month. And\u00a0with its more powerful ability to probe long wavelengths, Oesch\u00a0is hoping it might bring our galactic census a little closer to completion.\u00a0 [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]"
