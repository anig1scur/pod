Ask anyone what an elephant sounds like,\u00a0and they\u2019ll come up with something like this: [CLIP: Elephant trumpeting sounds] But some elephants can also do this: [CLIP: Elephant squeaking sounds] And researchers using an acoustic camera that converts sounds into colors have figured out how. The findings appear in the journal BMC Biology. [Veronika C. Beeck et al.,\u00a0A novel theory of Asian elephant high-frequency squeak production.] Elephants actually have a few ways they can get their message across. In addition to the traditional trumpet..., [CLIP: Elephant trumpeting sounds] ... they also communicate using a rumble whose pitch is often too low for humans to hear.\u00a0"
