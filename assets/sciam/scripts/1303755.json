I\u2019m Karen Hopkin. They say that lions are the king of the jungle. But a recent study shows that a single spritz of oxytocin\u2026a hormone known to promote social bonding\u2026renders even the most ornery alpha a total pussycat. The findings appear in the journal iScience."},{"author":"Craig Packer","text":": The greatest thing about watching lions is\u2026 lions are so openly and extravagantly affectionate with each other."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Craig Packer, director of the Lion Center at the University of Minnesota. He\u2019s been traveling to the Serengeti since the 1970s to study the social behavior of these big cats."},{"author":"Packer","text":": They just rub each other with their foreheads, their chins are in each other\u2019s faces. I mean they\u2019re just really into each other. And then when they calm down and it\u2019s time to go back to sleep\u2026one will flop down and the other will flop on top of it. So it\u2019s very endearing."},{"author":"Jessica Burkhart","text":": I\u2019ve always loved lions."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Jessica Burkhart is a grad student in Packer\u2019s pack."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": But what is it about lions that is so different than their closest relative the leopard, and then their next closest the tiger, who are completely solitary?"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": And the first thing that came to mind was: oxytocin."},{"author":"Packer","text":": They call oxytocin the love hormone. But that sounds like Love Potion Number Nine. I prefer to think of it as the affection hormone. if you have a nice warm hug, that burst of feeling you get, that\u2019s oxytocin. And so the lions would be like a perfect example of a species where you want to see what you can do with the oxytocin."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": They conducted the study at a wildlife sanctuary in South Africa\u2026.where their first challenge was figuring out how to get the hormone into the lions."},{"author":"Packer","text":": Jessica\u2026 surprised me with this perfume sprayer, which I just thought was so ingenious and it worked out really really well."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": It\u2019s like a little glass bottle with a long tip and then there\u2019s a bulb. So I have to pump the bulb and then the tip is about six inches long."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Burkhart would lure a lion over to the enclosure fence by waving a tasty hunk of meat."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": Once I hold that meat and the animal\u2019s grabbing it I can just stick it in the fence and into their nostril and spray away. [giggles]"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": The cats put up with the nasal invasion\u2026as long as they got their grub. But if Burkhart spritzed a lion after the meat was gone\u2026."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": You should see their faces. They go, huh? Like, how dare you take a cheap shot on me. They take it personally! [laughs\u2026] Ah, it\u2019s so funny."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": The researchers then assessed oxytocin\u2019s effects in several different behavioral situations. The first was seeing whether the hormone would make a lion less territorial when it comes to a desirable toy or a snack. Normally, lions are pretty protective of their possessions, particularly those that can be eaten."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": They\u2019ll growl and they\u2019ll snarl and \u2026 they smack and they scratch and they snap. So a lot of times you will just get this sort of reactive behavior where they\u2019re gonna lash out, to be like: Get off!"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": When it came to the toys, oxytocin did help to curb that reactive behavior, allowing other lions to come much closer. But it didn\u2019t do much for their monopolistic attitude toward meals, which Burkhart says was not entirely unexpected."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": With the toy, you know you\u2019re playful, you might be more inclined to having your partners play with you. When you have a food object, it\u2019s a much more primal instinct, so with the food trial, it\u2019s that innate desire to survive that causes this very reactive aggression."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Seeing that oxytocin suppressed aggression in one situation, but not the other, actually reassured the researchers that the hormone wasn\u2019t just making the lions totally dopey."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": It doesn\u2019t make your brain completely different, but it\u2019s like drinking your coffee in the morning."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": But if you\u2019re a testosterone-fueled grumpy Gus, it could render you almost delightfully demure."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": Oh my gosh, within minutes of the oxytocin that guy was completely chilled out. And I mean when we were giving him his oxytocin, he was growling, smacking the fence, totally insane, testosterone brain. And then he just completely mellowed out."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": But even more dramatic was the third test\u2026in which the researchers played an audio recording of an unfamiliar lion\u2019s roar. [Unfamiliar lion roar recording]"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Which can be as unnerving as it sounds. [Unfamiliar lion roar recording]"},{"author":"Packer","text":": It\u2019s like having a stranger in your bedroom saying I own this place, right?"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Now, in the control conditions\u2026in which lions got spritzed with a simple saline solution\u2026about half of them roared in return, maybe 50 or 60 times. [Lions roaring]"},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": That\u2019s about right. So half of the lions are gonna actually roar and the other half are gonna be looking, probably standing behind the guy that\u2019s roaring, and just looking and watching."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": But when the lions were dosed with oxytocin\u2026"},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": There were zero. I mean, zero. They completely did not roar. That was astounding. You could just see this difference in demeanor. They just laid there and they looked, they turned their heads, they were curious and they watched. But they\u2019re not getting up, puffing up, scent marking, and roaring, roaring, roaring."},{"author":"Packer","text":": With the oxytocin it was like, huh, strangers. No big deal. And in some cases it seemed they were more interested in head rubbing with each other rather than worrying about the stranger."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": The results give the team hope that oxytocin could provide a more effective way to introduce new lions into sanctuaries or reserves."},{"author":"Packer","text":": Because getting animals to become used to and accept strangers in their midst is an enormous challenge."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": That would be a big boost for conservation efforts."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": And \u2026 very key to using oxytocin to actually make a difference in the world."},{"author":"Hopkin: ","text":"A world with more tolerance and less roaring. It sounds darn near purr-fect."},{"author":"Hopkin: ","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science, I\u2019m Karen Hopkin."},{"author":"Burkhart","text":": So lions will do these sequences where they\u2019re like, roar, roar, uhh, uhh, uhh, and then they do grunts.
