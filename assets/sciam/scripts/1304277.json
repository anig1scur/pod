      "text": "Ever notice that some music just really makes you want to dance? Well, a new study shows that it is, indeed, all about the bass. Because researchers have found that, during a concert, boosting the bass bumps up the boogying. The results appear in the journal Current Biology."

      "text": "So, people who enjoy electronic dance music, or EDM, report that the thrumming bass produces a sensation that makes them want to move. And some studies have shown that our movements are more fine-tuned when we\u2019re locked onto bass notes."

      "text": "These are specialized speakers. Kind of like sub-subwoofers. People might have subwoofers as part of their stereo system. And these are speakers that play even lower frequencies than most systems are able to do. Even lower frequencies than we think are typically able to be heard."

Leave them off for two and a half minutes. Back on for two and a half minutes. Off for two and a half minutes. On off on off. Throughout the concert."

      "text": "What we found was, by looking at the motion capture data, people just moved more\u2014they covered more ground, they moved faster\u2014when the low frequency speakers were on. So this tells us that\u2026the extra bass, these very very low frequencies, caused more moving."

      "author": "Cameron",
      "text": "So people are more likely to feel good about one another and help one another if they\u2019ve had some experience synchronizing their movements together. And dance is a great, fun way to do this. This might be related to why we find dance in all cultures and throughout history for the human species. It\u2019s a fundamental part of being human."
