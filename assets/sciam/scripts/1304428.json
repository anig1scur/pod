I\u2019m Joseph Polidoro. As ecosystems go, seagrasses are right up there with rain forests and coral reefs."},{"author":"Austin Gallagher","text":"It's actually one of the most important hubs or magnets for biodiversity."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Austin Gallagher\u00a0is a marine biologist and CEO of Beneath the Waves, an ocean conservation nonprofit. Seagrasses are nurseries to a fifth of the world\u2019s largest fisheries and are shelters for thousands of species. They protect other habitats and coastlines. And they store enormous amounts of carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"It\u2019s sort of this incredible unsung hero of ocean conservation."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"But as much as half the world\u2019s seagrass is yet to be found. We\u2019re protecting these critical ecosystems with surveys that are as accurate as an early Renaissance map of the New World. That\u2019s because, unlike mangroves and warm-water coral reefs, seagrass meadows aren\u2019t always picked up by satellite or airplane observation. Cloud cover and glare from the seafloor also help keep the Bahamas seagrass hidden."},{"author":"Carlos Duarte","text":"There\u2019s a lot of false negatives and a lot of false positives."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Carlos Duarte\u00a0is a marine ecologist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"If I had tried to do it myself...,\u00a0 probably I would never have tried."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"For decades, Carlos had suspected that the Bahama Banks might host an enormous seagrass habitat. But he couldn\u2019t prove it."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"Remote sensing will never produce a reliable record. And then ground-truthing the Bahamas Banks, because of the sheer size, proved impossible."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Bu the way \u2014 ground-truthing is establishing the on-the-ground truth by direct observation. For seagrass, that\u2019s usually done by divers or by researchers on a boat."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"I really believe that if we had not come together like we did, this discovery might not have happened."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Then, by chance, Carlos met Austin\u2013and saw footage from Austin\u2019s\u00a0shark-mounted cameras."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"We saw these vast underwater seagrass meadows."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Carlos had found his ground-truthers."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"Tiger sharks were the total game changer of this whole process. Tiger sharks love seagrass habitat. So tiger sharks are this incredible ally."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"But how do you collaborate with a large carnivorous shark?"},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"These tiger sharks have teeth that are capable of doing some serious damage. And that\u2019s not demonizing them, that\u2019s just a fact."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"For the study, Gallagher\u2019s team caught eight tiger sharks and outfitted them with satellite tags. The researchers also attached cameras to seven more sharks. At first ..."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"Waves crashing, it\u2019s just hectic, everybody\u2019s shouting. We\u2019re reeling this animal in, trying to restrain it, put rope around its tail, fasten it to the side of the boat."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Once the shark is secured ..."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"Well it\u2019s actually kind of amazing. It just kind of chills out and is quite peaceful."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"In 12 minutes on average for each shark, the team took measurements, collected blood samples and installed the recording equipment. The sharks were then released to roam the Banks\u2019 seagrass meadows. The tiger sharks were much better observers than humans."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"They do about 70 kilometers per day, 24/7."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"They\u2019re also one fifth the cost of humans or drones. By combining the shark footage and location data with thousands of boat and diver surveys, the team could correctly interpret satellite images ..."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"Ultimately revealing the world\u2019s largest seagrass meadow, up to 93,000 square kilometers."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"That\u2019s about the size of Portugal and nearly 40 times the size of original estimates. The find increases known seagrasses globally by one third. The world\u2019s remaining undiscovered seagrass meadows will be smaller,\u00a0 Carlos says. To map them, Carlos will use another\u00a0\u00a0charismatic\u00a0denizen of sea grass ecosystems: sea turtles."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"We are doing that now in the Red Sea and getting a very reliable mapping. Not only where the seagrass meadows are but in the visual area that they cover."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"Carlos and his colleagues will soon be exploring near the Maldives and other archipelagos and island nations in Southeast Asia. Mapping seagrasses not only helps us protect them; it may also benefit the people who live near them."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"When you look at the carbon assets in the seagrass meadow and the avoided emissions that can be achieved through conservation and then apportion them to 300,000 people ..."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"He\u2019s referring to the population of the Bahamas\u2013now over 350,000 people ..."},{"author":"Duarte","text":"Basically every Bahamian owns a million bucks in carbon credits."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"The team\u2019s work also puts sharks in a new, more flattering light."},{"author":"Gallagher","text":"These tiger sharks led us to the seagrass meadows, and we now know that this is going to be a huge benefit for the people of the Bahamas moving forward. It really demonstrates that if you protect the sharks, which the Bahamas has done, then you could potentially protect the people. No small accomplishment for 15 tiger sharks and their human colleagues."},{"author":"Polidoro","text":"For\u00a0Scientific American\u2019s\u00a0Science, Quickly,\u00a0I\u2019m Joseph Polidoro.
