What was it about her story that was so compelling to you?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Well, actually, to be super honest about this, I was not that excited about doing a whole multi-episode season on Katharine because it takes so much time and it\u2019s really like researching a book\u2014it has taken us months. We\u2019ve been at this for almost a year on this season, I kid you not."},{"author":"","text":"However, my co-executive producer, Amy Scharf, for years, ever since we started [nearly] five years ago, has been, like, lobbying for Katharine Burr Blodgett. [Laughs.] I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. All right already. Okay, all right. I surrender.\u201d And one of the reasons she wanted to do a season on Katharine is that Katharine worked at the General Electric Research Laboratory, and so in looking at her we were gonna be looking at the whole history of industrial research labs, which is really interesting because there was a time in this country when big corporations put a lot of money and resources into pure research."},{"author":"","text":"So that\u2019s something that, especially in today\u2019s climate, it bears kind of reminding the public that that\u2019s what a lot of companies in this country did and no longer do."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So for people who maybe don\u2019t know what pure science is can you explain what that is?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Yeah, pure science is just thinking about a problem, a puzzle in the universe, and pursuing it, theorizing; it\u2019s theoretical science, versus experimental science. Often the two go hand in hand because someone cooks up a theory and then the experimenters come in and do the experiments to prove or disprove the theory. But it\u2019s really, like, fundamental questions\u2014like: \u201cWhat are the stars made of?\u201d \u201cWhat causes cancer?\u201d\u2014very pure questions that people should be free to wonder about."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And what was Katharine\u2019s expertise?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Oh, Katharine, don\u2019t get me started\u2014actually, do. So Katharine, she was a physicist and a chemist, and she was gifted in mathematics when she was super, super young. She went to Bryn Mawr [College], one of the Seven Sisters, and these colleges, several of them, started in the 1800s to really encourage women not only to get a higher education but to study science."},{"author":"","text":"So Katharine went to Bryn Mawr with an interest in mathematics. She got a big scholarship. She was 15\u2014I repeat ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Fifteen: one, five."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"She was so young."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"I know, so smart. And some physics professor noticed how smart she was and really nudged her toward physics. And then she picked up a bunch of physics in college and then went to graduate school at the University of Chicago."},{"author":"","text":"But the only place she ever wanted to work was the General Electric Company, for very mysterious reasons, which we get into, that had to do with her family and a terrible murder that happened."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"So we do a lot of probing of, you know, what motivated this brilliant young woman to want to go to only one place to work."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Well, she was doing this at a time, kind of at\u2014what you hinted at, when there were very few women in science."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Yeah, not only were there very few women in science, and even fewer in physics, but if you were a woman in science back then and you went and got a job at a university, at a corporation, you couldn\u2019t get married because if you got married, you had to quit. And we\u2019ve done episodes on women who\u2019ve kept their marriages secret, who\u2019ve kept pregnancies secret ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Who\u2019ve been fired when it was found out that they were married. So Katharine, she never married, which isn\u2019t to say she didn\u2019t want a life partner, because she did. And so it was tough."},{"author":"","text":"So she went on to get her Ph.D. She was the very first woman to get a Ph.D in physics from Cambridge University. And [Laughs] there\u2019s this great photograph. This was in 1926\u2014oh ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"A hundred years ago, right, and happy anniversary, Katharine\u2019s Ph.D. And she\u2019s sitting there [Laughs] flanked by all these white men. And one of them is [J. Robert] Oppenheimer, and one of them is Ernest Rutherford\u2014you know, several who went on to win the Nobel Prize. And there\u2019s Katharine in the front row, just sitting there kind of smiling, looking a little like, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d And can you imagine what it took to be the one woman surrounded by all these men?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I imagine it was rough."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"But, you know, she never ever said, \u201cI had it rough,\u201d ever. She never whined. She had it very rough, for many reasons that we get into later in the season, really deeply disturbing reasons. At least she didn\u2019t complain as far as we know\u2014she might have, like, complained privately to somebody."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"It does seem, in addition to, like, the work that she did in science, you\u2019re really making an effort to showcase her as a fully realized human. Why did you decide to take that task?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Yes, Kendra, thank you. Thank you so much. I was just thinking that last night. I was thinking, \u201cWhy am I killing myself here to tell the full, full story of this woman?\u201d I mean, we all got so attached to her on the production team. I\u2019m gonna\u2014this is ridiculous, but I\u2019m gonna start to cry."},{"author":"","text":"The reason this mattered is that these are not cartoon characters. These are not kind of one-off people. These are not freaks. She was, in fact, as you said, a fully realized human in so many ways. She was deeply religious. There were many other aspects to her. She was an amateur actor and poet. And the science she did was unbelievably difficult to pull off. And so you\u2019d think, \u201cOh, okay, that\u2019s what she did. She was this sort of conehead.\u201d But she was not; she was real. She loved to ski. She just had so much to her."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can you talk a little bit about the science that she was doing, or that she did?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Yes, you know, one thing that we do at Lost Women of Science a lot is get angry. In fact, our mantra is, \u201cWe\u2019re not mad; we\u2019re curious\u2014okay, we\u2019re a little mad,\u201d and we are. And then we tell the story of the woman and not of the man who either took credit when the credit should have gone to her or the men who surrounded her or the man who went on to get the Nobel Prize when she didn\u2019t. And I thought, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s do something different this season. Let\u2019s tell his story, too.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"So we tell the story of Irving Langmuir, who did go on and win the Nobel Prize, who was absolutely brilliant, who was the theorist. He was the guy\u2014getting back to your question earlier about pure research\u2014Langmuir was the guy who was pursuing all of these really big theoretical questions."},{"author":"","text":"And\u2014like, for instance, this is what got him the Nobel Prize, and it\u2019s what Katharine got involved in, was: You know when you pour oil on water how it stays there and then distributes itself in these colors? What he invented was this whole field of what\u2019s called surface chemistry, where he studied these layers of an oily substance on top of water, and he realized that they were a molecule thick."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"And then he and Katharine went on to build these multiple layers, all of them a single molecule thick, and then they realized that they could stack them. And then what do you do?"},{"author":"","text":"Well, what she then figured out and invented was she realized that when you stack them X number of layers, you get nonreflecting glass. Now, I\u2019m looking at you right now, and you\u2019ve got glasses on, and the light is not reflecting. Like, museum glass ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"All of this, that was\u2014Katharine had this eureka moment where she figured out that there are these surface coatings that she was putting on these layers, and once she got to 40 she held this glass up to a window, and the side that had the coating, kind of paradoxically, counterintuitively, the side that had the coating was not reflecting the light. And that was huge, huge. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s funny \u2019cause I live in New York City, and one of the big things that happens in New York City is bird strikes, and so there\u2019s a big push when you\u2019re making, you know, a tall office building to make sure that the glass has a nonreflective coating in it so that birds don\u2019t strike the building."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Oh, I had no idea. Yeah ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"That makes a ton of sense, doesn\u2019t it? Yeah ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Yeah, yeah, of course ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So a century later, almost, we\u2019re still using some of the ideas that she created, even if the coatings themselves are somewhere different."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Well, not just that\u2014I mean, everywhere: like, electronics and lenses and museum glass and you name it. But also what Katharine was doing, long before anyone came up with the term, was nanotechnology; she was engineering molecules."},{"author":"","text":"Not with fancy equipment: she was using [a version of] this thing that was actually invented by another woman in the 1800s who was in her kitchen in Germany, Agnes\u2014we\u2019re gonna do a bonus episode on Agnes Pockels\u2014was in her kitchen in Germany looking at the soap suds and looking at the interaction between the soap and the water. I mean, who does that? I don\u2019t know about you, but I stand in the kitchen, and it\u2019s like, \u201cAm I done yet?\u201d"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Right? [Laughs.]"},{"author":"","text":"So Katharine was using Agnes\u2019s trough to dip these slides in and out and in and out, and, and it wasn\u2019t just like, \u201cDip, raise. Dip, raise.\u201d You had to be really, really, really patient, very delicate."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That\u2019s really cool. Why do you think it\u2019s important to center and highlight the stories of forgotten women in science?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"You mean aside from the fact that we\u2019re just so pissed off?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yes. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Well, think about it: I mean, 50 percent [Laughs] of the population, they did amazing things and/or had potential to do incredible things in science and really, really got shafted by history. And if you go back and look at all the women we\u2019ve done, they are across nationalities, races, ethnicities, religions."},{"author":"","text":"And this kind of discrimination was absolutely rampant, and women were not thought fit to be scholars, not fit to be scientists, and were actively discouraged, and think about those who just did it anyway. So what we could do is we go back and we revisit the historical record one woman at a time, and we have a database of about 400 women at this point, all of whom deserve better."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah. Circling back to Katharine Burr Blodgett for a second, you know, you said you\u2019ve done almost a year\u2019s worth of research on her, and I don\u2019t wanna give any spoilers away [Laughs] to our listeners, but was there any story or information that you stumbled across that you found really surprising or compelling that you\u2019d wanna share?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"I can\u2019t because it\u2019s a big reveal. But what I can say is that we stumbled on it over the summer, and the way we stumbled on it\u2014and this is kind of a lesson in kind of perseverance in journalism, and, you know, like, just go around that next corner \u2019cause you never know what you\u2019re gonna find\u2014we found this in a family\u2019s storage locker in New Hampshire. And otherwise, we would\u2014never would\u2019ve found the things we found."},{"author":"","text":"And what I can say is that Katharine, what makes her so remarkable as a fully realized human being is how hard she worked to understand herself. And she was a scientist in her garden, she was a scientist at work, and she was a scientist of herself."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That sounds really lovely, and I\u2019m excited to listen to the season. Can you tell our listeners where they can find the season?"},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Well, anywhere that you get your podcasts, of course, but also, we have a very full, rich website, where you can see the transcript, and that\u2019s LostWomenofScience.org, LostWomenofScience.org."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Thank you so much for your time."},{"author":"Hafner","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That\u2019s all for today. See you on Monday for our weekly science news roundup."},{"author":"","text":"But I have a favor to ask before you go. I need your help for a future episode\u2014it\u2019s about kissing.

I\u2019m gonna\u2014this is ridiculous, but I\u2019m gonna start to cry."]},{"begin":"416.480","end":"453.320","lines":["The reason this mattered is that these are not cartoon characters. These are not kind of one-off people. These are not freaks. She was, in fact, as you said, a fully realized human in so many ways. She was deeply religious. There were many other aspects to her. She was an amateur actor and poet. And the science she did was unbelievably difficult to pull off. And so you\u2019d think, \u201cOh, okay, that\u2019s what she did. She was this sort of conehead.\u201d But she was not; she was real. She loved to ski.

And then we tell the story of the woman and not of the man who either took credit when the credit should have gone to her or the men who surrounded her or the man who went on to get the Nobel Prize when she didn\u2019t.

What he invented was this whole field of what\u2019s called surface chemistry, where he studied these layers of an oily substance on top of water, and he realized that they were a molecule thick."]},{"begin":"528.680","end":"529.360","lines":["Oh, wow."]},{"begin":"529.360","end":"541.720","lines":["And then he and Katharine went on to build these multiple layers, all of them a single molecule thick, and then they realized that they could stack them. And then what do you do?"]},{"begin":"541.720","end":"556.560","lines":["Well, what she then figured out and invented was she realized that when you stack them X number of layers, you get nonreflecting glass.

Like, museum glass ..."]},{"begin":"556.560","end":"556.680","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"556.680","end":"581.520","lines":["All of this, that was\u2014Katharine had this eureka moment where she figured out that there are these surface coatings that she was putting on these layers, and once she got to 40 she held this glass up to a window, and the side that had the coating, kind of paradoxically, counterintuitively, the side that had the coating was not reflecting the light. And that was huge, huge. [Laughs.]"]},{"begin":"581.520","end":"595.960","lines":["Yeah, it\u2019s funny \u2019cause I live in New York City, and one of the big things that happens in New York City is bird strikes, and so there\u2019s a big push when you\u2019re making, you know, a tall office building to make sure that the glass has a nonreflective coating in it so that birds don\u2019t strike the building."]},{"begin":"595.960","end":"598.280","lines":["Oh, I had no idea.
