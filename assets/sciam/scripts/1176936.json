I\u2019m Shahla Farzan. Many plants and animals use temperature and other environmental cues like a calendar\u2014letting them know when it\u2019s time to bloom or find a mate. But climate change is disrupting these natural rhythms worldwide, from songbird migration across North America to plankton growth cycles in Norway\u00a0to a hillside of wildflowers in Missouri.\u00a0"},{"author":"Matthew Austin","text":"If we head on out, you can notice a number of different species that have popped up: dwarf crested iris, blue phlox, Canadian wood betony."},{"author":"Farzan","text":"Matthew Austin is a postdoctoral researcher with the Living Earth Collaborative at Washington University [in St. Louis]. This patch of forest\u2014about 40 miles west of St. Louis\u2014is covered with native wildflowers throughout the spring and summer. But the timing of when they bloom has changed in recent decades, Austin says."},{"author":"Austin","text":"A warming climate is not only causing flowers to bloom earlier, but in many species, it\u2019s also causing them to end flowering later."},{"author":"Farzan","text":"Missouri wildflowers are blooming up to a week longer than they used to, compared to data collected in the 1930s and 1940s. And that\u2019s created a late summer pileup of species flowering all at once. Meanwhile\u00a0bumblebees and other pollinators are flitting from species to species, says Nicole Miller-Struttmann, a biologist at Webster University.\u00a0"},{"author":"Nicole Miller-Struttmann","text":"\u00a0When a pollinator makes a decision about who it\u2019s going to visit, that influences the pollen that they\u2019re carrying on their body. And flowers, not too surprisingly, don\u2019t really want pollen from another plant species."},{"author":"Farzan","text":"A flower that gets pollen from the wrong species might not be able to reproduce\u2014or it could push some to self-pollinate\u2014an extreme form of inbreeding. To understand how this might affect reproduction, Matthew Austin has been pollinating hundreds of Missouri wildflowers by hand this year. Some experimental flowers get pollen from their own species. Others get pollen from different plant species to simulate what\u2019s happening now, as climate change causes that pileup of species blooming at the same time. To keep pollinators from visiting his flowers, he slips sheer mesh bags over the buds before they open. But just as he removes the bag to tap pollen onto the flower\u2019s sticky stigma, a tiny bee lands on it."},{"author":"Austin","text":"Oh no, it just stuck right in there. A pollinator got in there when I had it unbagged. They\u2019re sneaky. So this one will not be included, but thankfully, there\u2019s another one."},{"author":"Farzan","text":"He moves on to the next flower, a human meticulously doing the work of a bee. It\u2019s a slow process\u2014but Austin hopes the results will help us understand how climate change is reshaping this complicated ecosystem.
