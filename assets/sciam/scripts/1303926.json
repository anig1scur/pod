We\u2019re still losing 400 to 500 Americans every day to COVID. But I think I can get back to work, at least from home, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve infected anyone around me, and if I stop testing positive I can get out of the house."

Barry, author of a comprehensive history of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Barry told me then that the decision about when a pandemic ends is as much a human one as a scientific one."

For influenza pandemics, they\u2019re usually considered to be in a post-pandemic phase when flu cases return to seasonal levels. But it\u2019s not clear what those will be for COVID, or if we\u2019ve even gotten there yet."
