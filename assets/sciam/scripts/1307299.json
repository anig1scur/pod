As a result, towns on the cape are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to install sewers and upgrade septic systems. But what if there was a cheaper solution? Some say there is: it\u2019s called urine diversion, or \u201cpee-cycling.\u201d For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to the final episode of our three-part Fascination series on Cape Cod\u2019s water pollution. We\u2019re calling this episode \u201cLiquid Gold.\u201d This week, WBUR\u2019s Barbara Moran is taking us to Falmouth, Massachusetts.

Nice to meet you."},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"Hi, thank you."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"This is amazing!"},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"Oh, thank you."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Earle Barnhart lives in a beautiful house in Falmouth with his wife, Hilda Maingay. There\u2019s a huge vegetable garden and fruit trees."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Oh, there\u2019s chickens!"},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"Oh, it\u2019s like a country club for the chickens [laughs]."},{"author":"Moran","text":"But I\u2019m not here to see the chickens. I\u2019m here to see the bathroom\u2014because Earle and Hilda are known on Cape Cod as the \u201cpower couple of pee-cycling.\u201d [CLIP: \u201cWe Are Giants,\u201d by Silver Maple] Yes, they recycle their urine. All those luscious vegetables are grown on what Earle calls liquid gold."},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"In nature you have plants and animals, and the animals eat the plants, and the waste from the animals go back to the plants, and the nutrients go round and round. Humans don\u2019t do that at all."},{"author":"Moran","text":"What most humans on Cape Cod do is use septic tanks. So all those nutrients leach into local bays and ponds, where they feed algae and invasive plants. The algae and plants grow out of control, sucking up oxygen in the water, killing fish and turning the bottom to muck. To solve that problem Falmouth had a plan."},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"Falmouth, our town, was gonna spend $600 million over 40 years and build as many sewers as they could in that time. And that\u2019s a huge amount of money for a town of 30,000 people. So we started studying alternatives to sewers."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Earle and Hilda\u2019s research led them to the Rich Earth Institute, a Vermont nonprofit that studies urine diversion. They learned that about 80 percent of the nitrogen in wastewater comes from urine ..."},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"And that if you could divert the urine only, you could divert 80 percent of the nitrogen that\u2019s causing the trouble."},{"author":"Moran","text":"So they did: they bought urine-diverting toilets for their home. And Hilda is gonna show me one."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Okay, okay, so here we are in the bathroom. It looks like a normal toilet."},{"author":"Hilda Maingay","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"So then you sit on it, and sort of the chute opens in the back, and that\u2019s where the poo goes\u2014I see. And then there\u2019s, like, a little chute ..."},{"author":"Maingay","text":"For the urine in the front. It never fails."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Never fails? I went back to find out."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Gonna shut the door here. Okay, I am actually going to use this toilet. Spoiler: I am not going to tape this. But I will give a report back after. Stand by for the report. [CLIP: \u201cSorvete de Lim\u00e3o,\u201d by Martin Landstr\u00f6m]"},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Okay, well, overall that was pretty anticlimactic. So I just peed. The pee went down where it was supposed to go, and that was that."},{"author":"Moran","text":"The pee goes into a tank in the basement, and Hilda and Earle use it in their garden as fertilizer. And they\u2019re not the only ones who consider urine to be precious liquid gold."},{"author":"Brian Baumgaertel","text":"I would argue that wastewater is a resource. You know, here in the United States we\u2019re not very good at reusing this resource, but in other parts of the world it\u2019s something that they wouldn\u2019t waste."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Remember Brian Baumgaertel? He\u2019s the director of the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center. And his group is doing a whole research project on pee-cycling. He says we\u2019re thinking about wastewater all wrong."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"Yes, it\u2019s got stuff in it that we don\u2019t necessarily like because it might make us sick. But nitrogen is one of the things that we utilize for fertilizer."},{"author":"Moran","text":"And that matters because fertilizer production is a climate problem. [CLIP: \u201cWorking It Out,\u201d by Jan Bj\u00f6rk]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Making synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires so much fossil fuel that its carbon dioxide footprint is comparable to that of the U.K. Using recycled urine for fertilizer instead could help curb the demand for the synthetic stuff."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"So we\u2019ve got a material that we\u2019re sending down into the ground every day that\u2019s a resource, and we\u2019re wasting [it]. And in the past they would have been like, \u201cWhat are you doing? What are you doing with that?\u201d [Laughs] You know?"},{"author":"Moran","text":"And there are other pros to pee-cycling. It\u2019s relatively cheap compared with sewers or advanced septic: it costs about $6,000 to install a fancy system like the one Earle and Hilda have. And if you don\u2019t want to sprinkle your tinkle on your flower beds, getting your urine hauled away is pretty cheap. Or for less than $100 you can get a portable urinal called a Cubie. And people could start pee-cycling quickly, without having to wait decades for sewers."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"You know, I think there\u2019s a lot of advantages. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the sort of end solution for the wastewater problem. Maybe it is for some folks."},{"author":"Moran","text":"There are, of course, challenges. Cape Cod doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure to recycle everyone\u2019s urine yet\u2014and there\u2019s the \u201cick\u201d factor to overcome. But still, folks are interested. Earle and Hilda host regular open houses to teach people about pee-cycling. One day last fall more than a dozen people showed up."},{"author":"Barnhart","text":"Yeah, we\u2019re gonna show you how our house is set up in two groups, and then we\u2019ll come back out and talk some more."},{"author":"Moran","text":"A group follows Hilda into the bathroom and then downstairs to see the storage tanks. One guy on the tour, Rob Pacheco of Falmouth, thought it was interesting."},{"author":"Rob Pacheco","text":"I think that it\u2019s something that we need to adopt the idea of, you know, in general. Just not sure of how to install everything [laughs]."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Toby and Rich Stomberg were more enthusiastic. They have a house in Eastham, Massachusetts, a town that has the same water problems as the rest of the cape."},{"author":"Toby Stomberg: ","text":"And it\u2019s such an amazing solution. So for us it\u2019s just taking the time to get it going in our own home. And then if that sort of spreads to our neighbors, well, that would be really nice."},{"author":"Rich Stomberg","text":"I point out, too, that we have solar panels on our roof, and we got lots of money back from the state and government that really made it easy for us to do that.... And the government is not supporting this. [CLIP: Theme music]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"That might change\u2014at least in Falmouth. The town is considering a urine-diversion pilot project for at least 50 homes. If the town decides to move forward with the project, it may be the first program of its kind in the country."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s a wrap on our Fascination miniseries about Cape Cod\u2019s yellow tide.
