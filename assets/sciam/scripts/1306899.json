The other voice you just heard was my friend, poet Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer. Over the next five episodes, I\u2019ll be talking with people like her: explorers who work in the realm of uncertainty. Through them, we\u2019ll discover the ways that uncertainty can spark curiosity and scientific breakthroughs. But we\u2019ll also find out how uncertainty can bite us in the butt and make science really hard. We\u2019ll see how neglecting uncertainty can lead to overconfidence and how embracing uncertainty can allow for a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the world. We\u2019ll finish by examining how it\u2019s possible to have confidence in scientific findings, even with their uncertainties. But I wanted to start by following Rosemerry\u2019s advice, so I consulted some poets\u2014starting with her, of course. Rosemerry, can you read one of your uncertainty poems?"

What are the cons?\u201d And you could not reach a clear decision. You gave up, and you said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see; I am unable to make a decision.

      "author": "Aschwanden",
      "text": "I know what Helga means. But I also understand why people look to science for certainty. When I was growing up, I thought of science as a fountain of facts. In high school I loved how science could name all the muscles in my body and give me formulas for calculating how much energy it would take to climb up a mountain or achieve liftoff in an airplane. The science that most of us first encounter in school is a world of facts and settled science. There\u2019s a lot of this kind of science. These are the things that we know with enough certainty and confidence that we can use them to cure diseases and build spaceships. But most working scientists don\u2019t operate in the realm of the known. They may be aiming to get there, trying to answer questions and understand things, but the nitty-gritty work of most researchers takes place in the realm of uncertainty. I didn\u2019t really understand that as a recently minted college graduate in biology in the 1990s. Back then I didn\u2019t fully understand how fundamental uncertainty is to science. It was a lesson I learned gradually over several years as a researcher, followed by two decades as a science journalist. But I can point to a place where the essential nature of uncertainty and science really congealed for me, and that\u2019s the Santa Fe Institute, or SFI, where I was a journalism fellow in 2015. Here is how the late novelist Cormac McCarthy described this research hub in New Mexico\u2019s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. [CLIP: Cormac McCarthy speaks: \u201cI\u2019m Cormac McCarthy, and this has to do with the Santa Fe Institute. This is a place where I\u2019ve been for a number of years. Recently I was asked to look at a paper that they had drawn up, and I think they called it a mission statement, but it had to do with what we do here. And they asked me if I could spruce it up a bit. And I said, \u201cWell, I could probably spruce it up a bit.\u201d So I wadded it up and pitched it in the trash, and this is what I came up with. Scientific work at SFI is always pushing creativity to its practical limits. We always court a high risk of failure. Above all, we have more fun than should be legal.\u201d]"
    },
    {
      "author": "Aschwanden",
      "text": "He went on further, but the thing to know is that SFI brings people from different scientific disciplines together to expose them to ideas outside their siloed fields. Most researchers there share an office, and there\u2019s an unwritten rule that your office-mate is from a different discipline. SFI is a place where visitors are constantly coming through to share new ideas. Uncertainty is an ongoing theme. And there\u2019s a person there who really exemplifies the excitement that uncertainty brings to science.\u00a0"

      "text": "Spend some time doing scientific experiments, and you\u2019ll also discover that uncertainty can be a giant pain in the rear. It turns out that some kinds of uncertainty are hard to see, and that can make the work of scientists really challenging. That\u2019s next time on Uncertain. Our show is produced by me, Christie Aschwanden, and Jeff DelViscio. Our series art is by Annaissa Ruiz Tejada. Our music is from Epidemic Sound.\u00a0 Funding for this series was provided by UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center\u2013it\u2019s part of the Expanding Awareness of the Science of Intellectual Humility Initiative, which is supported by the John Templeton Foundation.\u00a0 This is Uncertain, a podcast from Scientific American. Thanks for listening. Listen to episode 2 of Uncertain"
