[CLIP: Chris Farley on Saturday Night Live: \u201cI am El Ni\u00f1o. All other tropical storms must bow before El Ni\u00f1o.\u201d]"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Okay, so just in case you didn\u2019t catch the reference, that was comic Chris Farley..."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"\u2026in 1997 on Saturday Night Live. Farley did the bit because that year was one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o on record."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"So it was definitely on the public\u2019s mind in a big way. Though he got the science wrong."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"It was hilarious, but yep. El Ni\u00f1o isn\u2019t a tropical storm, like he said."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"What it actually is \u2026 a natural climate pattern."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"It\u2019s a cycle, really \u2026 a push and pull between wind and water over the Pacific Ocean."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Right. The whole cycle is actually called ENSO\u2013the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. The oscillation part is because it seesaws\u00a0 between warm and cold states about every two to seven years."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Okay, so, Andrea, let\u2019s help everyone sorta mentally picture this."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Right, sure, well, imagine we\u2019re out in the tropical Pacific, kinda hovering above the Earth, looking down."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"And we\u2019d need to be able to see the temperature of the ocean below us, right?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s important because when El Ni\u00f1o really gets going what we\u2019d see is this tremendously large lobe of warm water that starts to stretch across the equatorial pacific from east moving west."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"And that\u2019s not how it normally looks in that part of the Pacific, right?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Right. Normally, during the \u201cneutral\u201d setting the western tropical Pacific is much warmer than the eastern."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"So that\u2019s just one way to tell if an El Ni\u00f1o is in effect. But how warm is that lobe of water? And how long does it last?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Ithas to be 0.5 C above normal. And it has to stay that way for at least three months. And, by the way, it has a counterpart, La Ni\u00f1a, with cold waters, 0.5 C below average. But that\u2019s a podcast for another day."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Got it. So we\u2019ve got this big anomalous water feature. But the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o don\u2019t stop at the ocean, do they?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Nope. The whole climate system is interconnected. And the ocean affects the atmosphere. And the Ni\u00f1o on what happens with weather elsewhere. It\u2019s like a weather domino effect when it gets going."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Okay, let\u2019s do a rundown of some of those dominos. What are they and where do they happen?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Okay, here are some major examples of effects: Instead of usual rising air and rainy conditions in southeast Asia, that area sees subsiding air, which means dry weather and can cause drought. In 2016 there was a major drought in Indonesia that caused food shortages and helped fuel huge wildfires. Meanwhile other places, such as part of eastern Africa and parts of South America, often see higher rainfall, which can cause major flooding. Changes in looping air patterns also alter things like the jet stream across the U.S."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"and tends to bring cooler weather to the south and warmer to the north. Also, because it\u2019s not all bad news, we do tend to see less hurricane activity in the Atlantic. That\u2019s because the atmosphere is more stable\u2014hurricanes need unstable air to get going. (But this year there are also super warm ocean waters\u2014that\u2019s like hurricane fuel\u2014and it\u2019s hard to know which influence will win out. So TBD on that one.)"},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Wow. That\u2019s a global weather monkey wrench. But, you know, the reason we\u2019re talking about this today on the podcast is because the Ni\u00f1o is here. So, \u201cnews we can use\u201d time. Do you know what we might expect from this one?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Well, very tricky to forecast, but right now, there are slightly better-than-even odds that this event will develop into a strong one. It should build in strength in the coming months. And El Ni\u00f1os typically peak in the Northern Hemisphere winter. And strength is important because we have more confidence will see certain effects when it\u2019s stronger. Though nothing is a guarantee\u2014a strong event in 2016 didn\u2019t bring needed rains to SoCal as the one in 1998 did."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"So that\u2019s weather, but how is it going to affect global temps? Things are already getting warmer with climate change. Does an El Ni\u00f1o add to that?"},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Unfortunately, an El Ni\u00f1o would add to the heat for sure. They always bump up the global average temperature and can frequently set yearly heat records. 2016 is still the hottest year on record, thanks, in part, to the major El Ni\u00f1o that year. But really it\u2019s adding on to the background global warming signal\u20142016 was half a degree C warmer than 1998 (at the time, 1998 was far and away the hottest year). Given El Ni\u00f1o and a good chance it will be strong, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see a global heat record this year or next."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Ugh. Great. Well, more heat on top of our hotter world ain\u2019t great. But honestly, knowing how El Ni\u00f1o works shows, in a pretty profound way, that everything in Earth\u2019s climate is connected."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"Yep, that\u2019s right. This change in the ocean and air thousands of miles away from where you live will affect your weather in the coming months. And once you know it, you can prepare for it."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"And to help you do that, here are some sites you can go to track how Ni\u00f1oish this one is getting. We\u2019ll leave links in the show transcript."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"The Climate Prediction Center at NOAA\u2014that\u2019s the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2014puts out weekly and seasonal forecasts."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Columbia University has this group called the International Research Institute for Climate and Society. They have a El Ni\u00f1o forecast, so you can know if it\u2019s coming before it gets going. But they track it as it goes, too."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"And if you live in the Southern Hemisphere, Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology is a great one to hit up."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"And, of course, Andrea is on this. So, you can always check sciam.com for El Ni\u00f1o news as it develops."},{"author":"Thompson","text":"This is my life."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Good thing, it\u2019s news we can all use.

In 2016 there was a major drought in Indonesia that caused food shortages and helped fuel huge wildfires. Meanwhile other places, such as part of eastern Africa and parts of South America, often see higher rainfall, which can cause major flooding. Changes in looping air patterns also alter things like the jet stream across the U.S."]},{"begin":"182.240","end":"204.200","lines":["and tends to bring cooler weather to the south and warmer to the north. Also, because it\u2019s not all bad news, we do tend to see less hurricane activity in the Atlantic. That\u2019s because the atmosphere is more stable\u2014hurricanes need unstable air to get going.

And strength is important because we have more confidence will see certain effects when it\u2019s stronger.

They always bump up the global average temperature and can frequently set yearly heat records. 2016 is still the hottest year on record, thanks, in part, to the major El Ni\u00f1o that year. But really it\u2019s adding on to the background global warming signal\u20142016 was half a degree C warmer than 1998 (at the time, 1998 was far and away the hottest year).
