      "text": ": One of my New Year\u2019s resolutions was to be less burned-out. Maybe you can relate; you think, 'I\u2019m going to better manage my stress this year. I\u2019m going to make time for activities that I find nourishing and finally nail that work/life balance.'\u00a0But just a few weeks into January, I found myself hitting a wall. The sense of renewal of a new year didn\u2019t manifest. The burnout I felt from 2023 had followed me\u2014all the way into February. Burnout feels like something that descends upon you and then is impossible to shake off. A 2021 study found that around three in five employees felt symptoms of burnout, and COVID didn\u2019t make it easier. More people found their work lives getting more unmanageable during the pandemic, not less. When my resolution to fix my burnout with effort didn\u2019t work, I wanted to go back to the beginning of burnout\u2019s story and understand what it is. I\u2019m Shayla Love, and you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly. [CLIP: Music] Today we\u2019re revisiting the concept of burnout: a word people use to describe how they feel exhausted, psychically tired with their jobs\u2014that they may love!\u2014or drained by the other obligations in their never ending to-do lists."

People were starting \u201cto fail, wear out, or become exhausted by making excessive demands on energy, strength, or resources,\u201d he wrote, and it was happening to the most dedicated and committed people he knew.

Hearing these older stories reminded me of the overwhelming response to writer Anne Helen Petersen\u2019s 2019 article on millennial burnout in BuzzFeed News.

And that\u2019s because burnout, as it was originally conceived, is a social problem. It\u2019s not that you are tired of parenting or volunteering for no reason. It\u2019s probably because you\u2019re not getting enough help, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re making an impact and you\u2019re not in control of your schedule or what you\u2019re doing.You can\u2019t take on the job of feeling better all by yourself.
