I mean, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve thought about your hair\u2014in terms of which way to get it cut and how to get that one really wonky piece to behave itself\u2014but have you ever considered why it is the way it is?"},{"author":"","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. My guest today is biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan. She leads a lab that studies the \u201cevolution and genetic basis of human phenotypic variation, with a focus on pigmentation and hair.\u201d In other words she\u2019s figuring out why human skin and hair comes in so many gorgeous varieties."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for joining us to chat today."},{"author":"Tina Lasisi","text":"Great to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So I\u2019ve been a fan of your research for a few years now \u2019cause, among other things, you\u2019re really asking and answering questions about hair that I don\u2019t think anyone else is tackling. How did you get interested in your field of study, and would you tell our listeners a little bit about it?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Absolutely. So I got interested in this when I was an undergrad. I did my undergrad at the University of Cambridge, where I was studying archaeology and anthropology, which there consists of studying archaeology, biological anthropology and social anthropology."},{"author":"","text":"And I was always someone who really liked culture and traveling, so I thought I was gonna be a cultural anthropologist, but I got this lecture in the evolution of human skin color that really had me intrigued, and it was a lecture where they showed, you know, those really famous map pairings where you see the distribution of skin color around the world and the distribution of UV radiation, and it was just like this [makes explosion noise], you know, brain-exploding moment of like, \u201cWow, like I never thought about that,\u201d and learning more about evolution and how there\u2019s all these processes that can shape the way that humans are\u2014the way that a lot of different species are, right\u2014that really got me intrigued, and I felt like, \u201cOkay, now I understand why my skin is the color that it is,\u201d but my immediate next question was: \u201cWell, why is my hair curly?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"And there wasn\u2019t a great answer at the time, and I was lucky enough to be in a really supportive environment, and I had a mentor who said, \u201cYou know, why don\u2019t you just go into the science side of anthropology and study this?\u201d And so, what year are we in\u20142025? Okay, 14 years later, here I am [laughs] still working on that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and, you know, it sounds like the nature of your work is pretty interdisciplinary. You know, how would you summarize everything you\u2019re looking at to someone who\u2019s not familiar with your work?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"That\u2019s such a great question. I\u2019m actually teaching an introduction to anthropology class right now, and I\u2019m trying to explain to the students, like, \u201cAnything can be anthropology, and everything can be anthropology.\u201d You can use so many different methods. So right now, I would say I am definitely an evolutionary biologist. I work on human biology. I also work on\u2014thermoregulation is work that I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019ve worked with thermal engineers. I also have worked on genetics; that\u2019s a big part of what I do. I\u2019m also in a Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. So all of those little bits and pieces, they give a different insight into the question that you can ask, and so everything that I do involves sitting [laughs] behind a computer, mostly, but also collecting samples from people and measuring things with various instruments and a lot of computer imaging, basically [basically]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. And so, broadly speaking, why is it that people have so much variation in their hair and skin?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Mm-hmm. So the reason is simultaneously because of natural selection and because of the absence of natural selection. So the story that we\u2019ve been able to piece together for skin color is that very long ago\u2014somewhere between, you know, two to one million years ago\u2014as the genus Homo was emerging, we were completely bipedal and at some point would have started losing our body hair, so really reducing those hair follicles so that we have like, this, tiny peach fuzz all over our body. And by doing that we have lost a really important barrier, right? So a lot of people can associate hair with keeping you warm, but it can also protect you from UV radiation. And so those ancestors probably would have been under selective pressure to evolve darker skin because by having more melanin in your skin, that\u2019s another way that you can protect yourself from that UV radiation."},{"author":"","text":"The story afterwards is one of adaptation to different environments. So it turns out that having all of that wonderful melanin to protect you is great when there\u2019s a lot of solar radiation, but if you\u2019re in an environment with not a lot of radiation, you end up running into issues with being able to produce enough vitamin D ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Which is something you can only do in your body with the power of solar radiation that helps you convert it into an active form. Now, there are, of course, exceptions to that because there are places in the world where people have diets that are rich in naturally occurring vitamin D, like in the Arctic."},{"author":"","text":"And since all those times we\u2019ve moved to so many different places, and you have all of this variation that\u2019s evolved because of that. And in the last, let\u2019s call it 200 years what\u2019s really nice is that we have developed all of these cultural ways of adapting to different places. So instead of being someone who maybe doesn\u2019t have a lot of melanin and going to a place that is very, very sunny and being like, \u201cWell, geez, I\u2019m gonna have to wait a couple of generations for evolution to fix it for my ancestors,\u201d we now have sunscreen and all of these other things that we can do. We have vitamin D supplementation."},{"author":"","text":"Now the story with hair, it\u2019s much more complicated to tell because we really don\u2019t know. The thing about hair and skin is that in both cases, they don\u2019t fossilize, and so we\u2019re having to infer a lot from the past. And we do that by putting together hypotheses and saying, \u201cWell, if this is the reason that natural selection would have selected for this kind of hair or that kind of skin, what\u2019s the distribution that we expect to see?\u201d And with hair we don\u2019t have a lot of thoroughly tested hypotheses, but some of the work that I did in my Ph.D. that got published a few years ago was asking the question: \u201cWell, does tightly curled hair reduce how much heat we might gain from solar radiation?\u201d And I found in my experiments that, yes, it really does have this role. And so now the question is: \u201cCan we also use genetics to ask, \u2018Well, how did this happen? What\u2019s the history of this? And what\u2019s the story for every group of people around the world?\u2019\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s so cool. I loved that study. It\u2019s not apparent \u2019cause it\u2019s pulled back and bleached within an inch of its life, but I have very curly hair [laughs]. And I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why when I get a blowout, I feel [laughs], I feel like my head is gonna sweat right off.\u201d Meanwhile, when people are like,\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t know how you live through the summer with that long hair,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about [laughs]. It\u2019s fine.\u201d So I love when the science answers questions I didn\u2019t even know I had."},{"author":"","text":"So a lot of the ways that we\u2019ve historically categorized different variations in hair and skin are, of course, really lacking and sometimes quite racist. What factors are actually at play that lead to differences in the makeup of our skin and hair, and how has your work changed the way you think about how we might describe or categorize those variations?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Mm-hmm, that\u2019s really an interesting question. So there\u2019s a number of factors that we can tease apart there, right? We can ask the question of: \u201cWhat are the mechanisms and the biological processes that contribute to this variation?\u201d When it comes to skin color, we\u2019ve known for a long time that it\u2019s melanin, but measuring how much melanin is in someone\u2019s skin is actually [laughs] really invasive. It\u2019s really invasive\u2014like you\u2019d have to have a skin punch, you\u2019d have to do various chemical analyses to measure exactly how much melanin and what kind of melanin is in there. So that\u2019s really difficult, and people need a shorthand, especially if you\u2019re doing population-wide studies. So people have tried to come up with really good descriptions, but descriptions can only go so far, and measuring something is so much better."},{"author":"","text":"So with the rise of reflectance spectrophotometers, we finally had a tool that could really easily and noninvasively measure the color of skin. So this can be done at various levels of detail."},{"author":"","text":"You can have one that is specifically trying to estimate the visible range of melanin, and it can give you something called melanin index, which is something that\u2019s been developed to say, \u201cOkay, well, how much melanin is in someone\u2019s skin?\u201d And so that really helped us collect a lot of accurate data, and in 2017, 2018 there were a lot of papers that came out saying, \u201cOh, wow, look at all of this variation in skin color that we didn\u2019t realize existed in Africa.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so that\u2019s where you have this really interesting insight of, \u201cOh, sometimes the words that we use and the variation that we think we\u2019re seeing doesn\u2019t align with what it is that we\u2019re measuring,\u201d which is why it\u2019s so important to have tools that measure things. With hair we suffer from a similar problem, where, okay, well, we have all these descriptions of straight, wavy, curly, but is that really what the range of the variation is?"},{"author":"","text":"However, there isn\u2019t a single thing that you can measure to define hair shape. There\u2019s a lot of things that you can measure\u2014if you are narrowing down to the level of a single hair fiber, in a single hair fiber you can get a cross section. You can slice that in half, look at that cross section and say, \u201cWell, how thick is that hair fiber? What shape is it?\u201d And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been doing for over 100 years, and we\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s a variation there. But when it comes to thecurl it\u2019s really difficult because hair curves in three dimensions."},{"author":"","text":"So that is the thing that I actually worked on the longest\u2014it took me 10 years to develop a method that I\u2019m, you know, remotely happy with. And it involves getting a little strand of hair, chopping it up into little pieces so that it only curves in two dimensions and then measuring the curvature by trying to, basically, fit a circle to it. So you can imagine: you have different types of curls, different sizes of curls, and the smaller the circle is that fits to that curl, the more curly that hair is, you could say. And so that is one method that you can have of really precisely, accurately measuring hair curvature."},{"author":"","text":"To answer the question of, \u201cWhy does hair curl?\u201d: well, we don\u2019t really know yet, and that\u2019s really interesting because when it comes to sheep\u2019s wool, so that doesn\u2019t curl, but it crimps; it has this wave. We know that it has to do with two different types of cells that are deposited in different ways. But when it comes to human hair curl we don\u2019t know what the mechanism is that makes hair curl, and it might be that there are many mechanisms that contribute to the shape. Some people have said that it\u2019s the shape of the hair follicle, but we still have a lot of work to do to be sure about that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and, you know, for folks who don\u2019t think about hair texture or curl at all, why is it important to answer these questions?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Mm-hmm, so it\u2019s important on a number of levels. First, from the perspective of someone who is really interested in human evolution, human origins, my desire to answer this comes from, you know, being, I don\u2019t want to say a natural historian, but that\u2019s really what you are when you\u2019re studying evolution and asking, like, \u201cWow, what is the story of our people as a whole?\u201d I would love to know: What is it that makes our hair the way that it is, and why are we the only mammals that have naked bodies and hair on their heads? That\u2019s weird. Not trying to judge here, but it\u2019s a little odd compared to all the other mammals. But there\u2019s a lot of other reasons that it might be useful to understand."},{"author":"","text":"So something that I\u2019m incredibly fascinated with is the potential to understand the variation within your ownbody through the hair follicle, right? You have hair follicles all over your body. Your eyebrows are hair, you know, your eyelashes are hair, and they are very different than the hair on your head. You might have body hair in various places. And yet you have the same DNA across your body; it\u2019s just how that DNA is used. And because you have this incredible structure, this hair follicle, which is the same thing all over your body, we have this unique opportunity to ask, \u201cOkay, well, how can we use the same DNA and a similar structure around the body and create different things?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And that\u2019s the kind of knowledge that you can apply to a lot of different ends. You could be asking questions about, \u201cWell, why do things go wrong when they go wrong? And what are various processes that affect how our DNA\u2019s able to express itself?\u201d Something that\u2019s incredibly interesting is a lot of people have reported to me, for themselves or someone they know, when they went through chemotherapy their hair texture changed."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Your DNA didn\u2019t change, right? But something about how your DNA is being used in those hair follicles has changed, and if we\u2019re able to make those associations, see what those links are, we can break down what the biological processes are that are going on, and that might lead to\u2014who knows what; you never know what you\u2019re gonna find in the type of science that I\u2019m doing [laughs], and that\u2019s what I love about it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah, awesome. What are some other big questions that you\u2019re still hoping to answer?"},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"So there are a number of adventures that I still want to go on when it comes to hair science, and one of them is, you know, understanding how various physiological processes can affect our hair. So thinking of even our own trajectories [laughs] through to adulthood, there was a time when we were probably marginally less hairy, and then puberty happened, and all of a sudden there was hair in places where it wasn\u2019t before, and maybe our hair was a little bit different [laughs] in places where we already had hair. And that\u2019s really interesting because we know that there\u2019s something going on endocrinologically that is, is changing our body and we have this external marker that is telling us, \u201cOkay, well, here are some changes,\u201d and so it\u2019s really interesting to ask that question."},{"author":"","text":"And then on the other end of that, once we\u2019re talking about aging, we have people who maybe start losing hair in certain places. It gets thinner or maybe it gets coarser, is something I\u2019ve heard people say. And so we can ask questions, again, about what\u2019s going on in your body and can we learn something from this external marker that is very noninvasive to say, \u201cOkay, this is giving me a window into your body about what could be going on\u201d?"},{"author":"","text":"And then the second part of hair science that I\u2019m really interested in right now is what we can learn from the hair fibers that are coming out of your body in terms of biomarkers."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"So there\u2019s a lot you can measure from hair. For example, right now in my lab one of my students is working on extracting cortisol from hair, and the way that your hair works it ends up being, like, this ice core of your body\u2019s physiology; it\u2019s constantly capturing bits of what\u2019s going on in your bloodstream. And so there\u2019s this incredible potential to get this slice-of-time view, if we can get our methods to be precise enough, of: \u201cThis is what was going on in your body a month ago, two months ago, three months ago.\u201d And it would be an incredible, noninvasive way to be able to keep track of cortisol, other hormones, and there\u2019s also a lot of toxicology that you can do with hair."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. Thank you so much for coming on to talk about this. I hope we can have you back soon to talk about more of your research."},{"author":"Lasisi","text":"Absolutely, this was so much fun."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

So the reason is simultaneously because of natural selection and because of the absence of natural selection. So the story that we\u2019ve been able to piece together for skin color is that very long ago\u2014somewhere between, you know, two to one million years ago\u2014as the genus Homo was emerging, we were completely bipedal and at some point would have started losing our body hair, so really reducing those hair follicles so that we have like, this, tiny peach fuzz all over our body. And by doing that we have lost a really important barrier, right? So a lot of people can associate hair with keeping you warm, but it can also protect you from UV radiation. And so those ancestors probably would have been under selective pressure to evolve darker skin because by having more melanin in your skin, that\u2019s another way that you can protect yourself from that UV radiation."]},{"begin":"313.720","end":"333.760","lines":["The story afterwards is one of adaptation to different environments.

The thing about hair and skin is that in both cases, they don\u2019t fossilize, and so we\u2019re having to infer a lot from the past. And we do that by putting together hypotheses and saying, \u201cWell, if this is the reason that natural selection would have selected for this kind of hair or that kind of skin, what\u2019s the distribution that we expect to see?\u201d And with hair we don\u2019t have a lot of thoroughly tested hypotheses, but some of the work that I did in my Ph.D. that got published a few years ago was asking the question: \u201cWell, does tightly curled hair reduce how much heat we might gain from solar radiation?\u201d And I found in my experiments that, yes, it really does have this role. And so now the question is: \u201cCan we also use genetics to ask, \u2018Well, how did this happen? What\u2019s the history of this?

So there\u2019s a number of factors that we can tease apart there, right? We can ask the question of: \u201cWhat are the mechanisms and the biological processes that contribute to this variation?\u201d When it comes to skin color, we\u2019ve known for a long time that it\u2019s melanin, but measuring how much melanin is in someone\u2019s skin is actually [laughs] really invasive. It\u2019s really invasive\u2014like you\u2019d have to have a skin punch, you\u2019d have to do various chemical analyses to measure exactly how much melanin and what kind of melanin is in there. So that\u2019s really difficult, and people need a shorthand, especially if you\u2019re doing population-wide studies. So people have tried to come up with really good descriptions, but descriptions can only go so far, and measuring something is so much better."]},{"begin":"559.400","end":"573.400","lines":["So with the rise of reflectance spectrophotometers, we finally had a tool that could really easily and noninvasively measure the color of skin.

There\u2019s a lot of things that you can measure\u2014if you are narrowing down to the level of a single hair fiber, in a single hair fiber you can get a cross section. You can slice that in half, look at that cross section and say, \u201cWell, how thick is that hair fiber? What shape is it?\u201d And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been doing for over 100 years, and we\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s a variation there.

And it involves getting a little strand of hair, chopping it up into little pieces so that it only curves in two dimensions and then measuring the curvature by trying to, basically, fit a circle to it. So you can imagine: you have different types of curls, different sizes of curls, and the smaller the circle is that fits to that curl, the more curly that hair is, you could say. And so that is one method that you can have of really precisely, accurately measuring hair curvature."]},{"begin":"707.200","end":"741.480","lines":["To answer the question of, \u201cWhy does hair curl?\u201d: well, we don\u2019t really know yet, and that\u2019s really interesting because when it comes to sheep\u2019s wool, so that doesn\u2019t curl, but it crimps; it has this wave. We know that it has to do with two different types of cells that are deposited in different ways. But when it comes to human hair curl we don\u2019t know what the mechanism is that makes hair curl, and it might be that there are many mechanisms that contribute to the shape. Some people have said that it\u2019s the shape of the hair follicle, but we still have a lot of work to do to be sure about that."]},{"begin":"741.480","end":"752.760","lines":["Yeah, well, and, you know, for folks who don\u2019t think about hair texture or curl at all, why is it important to answer these questions?"]},{"begin":"752.760","end":"793.320","lines":["Mm-hmm, so it\u2019s important on a number of levels. First, from the perspective of someone who is really interested in human evolution, human origins, my desire to answer this comes from, you know, being, I don\u2019t want to say a natural historian, but that\u2019s really what you are when you\u2019re studying evolution and asking, like, \u201cWow, what is the story of our people as a whole?\u201d I would love to know: What is it that makes our hair the way that it is, and why are we the only mammals that have naked bodies and hair on their heads? That\u2019s weird. Not trying to judge here, but it\u2019s a little odd compared to all the other mammals. But there\u2019s a lot of other reasons that it might be useful to understand."]},{"begin":"793.320","end":"840.080","lines":["So something that I\u2019m incredibly fascinated with is the potential to understand the variation within your ownbody through the hair follicle, right? You have hair follicles all over your body. Your eyebrows are hair, you know, your eyelashes are hair, and they are very different than the hair on your head. You might have body hair in various places. And yet you have the same DNA across your body; it\u2019s just how that DNA is used. And because you have this incredible structure, this hair follicle, which is the same thing all over your body, we have this unique opportunity to ask, \u201cOkay, well, how can we use the same DNA and a similar structure around the body and create different things?\u201d"]},{"begin":"840.080","end":"867.560","lines":["And that\u2019s the kind of knowledge that you can apply to a lot of different ends.

What are some other big questions that you\u2019re still hoping to answer?"]},{"begin":"898.920","end":"952.360","lines":["So there are a number of adventures that I still want to go on when it comes to hair science, and one of them is, you know, understanding how various physiological processes can affect our hair. So thinking of even our own trajectories [laughs] through to adulthood, there was a time when we were probably marginally less hairy, and then puberty happened, and all of a sudden there was hair in places where it wasn\u2019t before, and maybe our hair was a little bit different [laughs] in places where we already had hair. And that\u2019s really interesting because we know that there\u2019s something going on endocrinologically that is, is changing our body and we have this external marker that is telling us, \u201cOkay, well, here are some changes,\u201d and so it\u2019s really interesting to ask that question."]},{"begin":"952.360","end":"981.840","lines":["And then on the other end of that, once we\u2019re talking about aging, we have people who maybe start losing hair in certain places.

And so there\u2019s this incredible potential to get this slice-of-time view, if we can get our methods to be precise enough, of: \u201cThis is what was going on in your body a month ago, two months ago, three months ago.\u201d And it would be an incredible, noninvasive way to be able to keep track of cortisol, other hormones, and there\u2019s also a lot of toxicology that you can do with hair."]},{"begin":"1038.920","end":"1046.440","lines":["Very cool.
