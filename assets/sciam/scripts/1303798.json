      "text": "Every year, the Cancer Community Awards, sponsored by AstraZeneca, presents an individual or organization with the President\u2019s Award. This award recognizes those who are making a meaningful impact in the lives of cancer patients. In 2021, Margaret Stauffer received the President\u2019s Award for her work as the Chief Mission Officer of the Cancer Support Community in the San Francisco Bay Area. As we prepared for this year\u2019s awards, we reconnected with Margaret to hear more about what\u2019s happened since she received the award. Well, Margaret Stauffer, it\u2019s such a joy to get a chance to talk to you. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you\u2019ve been up to the past year."

    },
    {
      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "I say it\u2019s a place where people can come together and connect with others who understand what it\u2019s like to be dealing with a cancer diagnosis, and it\u2019s a place where they can become informed and empowered as they\u2019re going through cancer treatment and beyond. It\u2019s also a place for loved ones to get support for what they are going through, as well as the patient."

    {
      "author": "Hall",
      "text": "I understand that your mother went through a pretty brutal experience when she was diagnosed with cancer. Do you mind telling me a little bit about that experience and how it informed your work?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "Sure. First of all, I want to say it was a long time ago, so things have changed dramatically, both in terms of treatment and in terms of psychosocial support. But when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she had a radical mastectomy, and there were no support services for her. She just had the surgery, and she was expected to go on with her life. But her life was impacted tremendously by that. She was a pianist. She had to deal with lymphedema in her arm that made that difficult. She didn\u2019t know anybody else that had gone through something similar to what she had gone through. So it was very isolating and lonely and challenging for her, even though we, as her family, tried to do what we could. But we didn\u2019t really understand either at the time what the impacts were. What really drew me to the work at Cancer Support Community was being able to create a place where people could get that support, where they could learn about treatment options, where they could feel a sense of connection with other people who know what it\u2019s like to be dealing with this."

      "text": "If your mother could have benefited from the Cancer Support Community, what do you think she would\u2019ve done there? How would you have set her up with emotional and social support?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "Well, my mother didn\u2019t like to talk about things that were private or emotional. But I would really try to get her set up in a support group, because I think she would really have enjoyed being with other people and talking about their experiences. And I would\u2019ve also wanted her to access some of our healthy lifestyle classes, to try out a yoga class or a Qigong session, and to enjoy some of the social connections that we have. For example, we have a no-talent talent show every year, and I think she would\u2019ve loved the silliness and the fun and the creativity related to that."

      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "That\u2019s certainly a part of it, but as a marriage and family therapist working in the health arena, I\u2019ve seen over and over again the toll that physical illness takes on families and really want to have an impact on that, and find better ways of helping people get through that experience."
    },
    {
      "author": "Hall",
      "text": "You\u2019ve said that not addressing the emotional and social aspects of cancer care is like paying for an expensive car and not putting any gas in it. Do you mind explaining that a little bit?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "Well, medical treatment is incredibly important, of course. But we also know that there are so many other factors that contribute to whether or not somebody does well going through cancer treatment. The psychosocial aspect is critical. If you\u2019re getting great medical treatment, but you\u2019re really depressed, and you don\u2019t get to your doctor\u2019s appointment because you don\u2019t feel like getting out of bed, that\u2019s not going to help."

      "text": "Well, I think it\u2019s helped to increase the visibility of our organization. And one of the things we want to be able to do is help anybody impacted by cancer, who\u2019s in our geographic area, who wants our services. That additional exposure has been very important. And there\u2019s also the reality that there was a financial piece to the award, and that makes a significant difference in our ability to provide the services free of charge."

It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to see all the different work that\u2019s being done, both in terms of treatment advances, but also in terms of reaching people who\u2019ve traditionally been underserved, helping people who are in more remote areas get hooked up to cancer support and services. It\u2019s just very gratifying to see all the wonderful things that are being done to support people while they\u2019re going through treatment."

      "author": "Hall",

    {
      "author": "Stauffer",
      "text": "Well, I think there\u2019s a synergy that happens when you\u2019re connecting with other people, who are doing either similar work or new and different work to help people who are dealing with cancer. Being able to connect with other organizations, other hospital groups, other educational institutions, other non-profits that provide such critical support, it\u2019s a great way of learning from each other and supporting each other."

      "text": "I\u2019m looking forward to being in the same room with the person that I\u2019m speaking to. Part of the community that we create at Cancer Support Community is that connection with each other and being able to hug somebody, being able to offer them a box of tissues if they\u2019re having a difficult time, of being able to laugh together in the same room and feel that camaraderie and connection even more deeply than we can feel it when we\u2019re on a platform like Zoom."
