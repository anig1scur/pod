The scientists\u2019 paper in Current Biology points out that Indonesia is far from the only country suppressing scientific work. They cite examples from Turkey, Sweden, the U.S. and Australia, too. But in a nation such as Indonesia, with so much biodiversity on the brink, the stakes for endangered species are especially high."
