After all, a firmly monogamous relationship between two people\u2014ideally married\u2014is often portrayed in popular culture as #goals. And to some degree that is reflected in American attitudes. A 2023 YouGov survey, for example, found that 55 percent of Americans preferred some form of fully monogamous relationship."},{"author":"","text":"And yet that same poll found that roughly a third of Americans were interested in relationships that were something other than full monogamy. In fact, one in eight Americans said that, with their primary partner\u2019s permission, they had engaged in sexual acts with someone other than that partner. But for many of us, our understanding of nonmonogamous relationships\u2014especially polyamorous relationships, where people have multiple romantic relationships at the same time\u2014remains murky."},{"author":"","text":"I talked with Rebecca Lester, a professor of anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis and a licensed clinical social worker who recently wrote about polyamory in the March issue of Scientific American, to shed some light on the topic."},{"author":"","text":"Hi, Rebecca. Thanks for taking the time to join us today."},{"author":"Rebecca Lester","text":"I\u2019m happy to be here."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"How did you get interested in the subject of polyamory?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"I got interested in it many years ago through the process of my personal experiences in the dating world, actually. I had gone through a divorce, and I was back on the dating scene, and like most people these days I was on the apps, and it was something that I just kept seeing again and again on different profiles, people talking about nonmonogamy in all sorts of different ways. And so I got very intrigued by how just up front people were, how widespread it seemed to be, and as an anthropologist I got curious about what was going on."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can you give us a basic description of what polyamory is?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"Yeah, so polyamory is a form of what is called consensual or ethical nonmonogamy, and it is a situation where people have more than one romantic partner\u2014not just a sexual partner but an actual relationship, romantic partner\u2014and everybody in the situation is on board and consents to what\u2019s going on."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So the U.S. is, by and large, at least socialized to be a monogamous society ..."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And we often think that there\u2019s only one true love for us out there."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Right."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"How do polyamorists see love and intimacy sort of differ from how we\u2019ve been socially conditioned?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"So in polyamory the idea is that we have many people that we can love and who can love us; there\u2019s not just one true love out there that you seek, and you find, and then you live in married bliss forever\u2014or monogamous, doesn\u2019t have to be married. But in polyamory the concept is that, as humans, we\u2019re wired to connect, we\u2019re wired to love, we\u2019re wired to receive love and that that can take all sorts of different forms with different people."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can we talk a little bit about how polyamory is perceived in popular culture and then talk about sort of, how you highlight in the piece, the lived reality kind of contrasts with that?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"In popular culture the perceptions of polyamory generally are fairly negative, especially, you know, as it\u2019s grown in popularity and had portrayals on different media and things like that. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit well with our common understandings of what relationships, quote, unquote, should be, right? This idea that you\u2019re not just monogamous with one partner, but you have many partners is usually seen as something unethical in our society, right?"},{"author":"","text":"And so that kind of framework is placed on polyamory as well, whereas in reality it\u2019s very different than the way that most people think about it. The people that I spoke with and that I, that I know in this world, ethics is really at the heart of what they\u2019re doing, and so they take it very, very seriously that everybody be thoroughly informed and thoroughly consent to any arrangements that are happening."},{"author":"","text":"And so that\u2019s really different than the perception that it\u2019s just an excuse to cheat or it\u2019s a way to sneak around or whatever the case may be\u2014just get sex with different people. Like, it\u2019s very different than that, and unfortunately, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s often portrayed."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"People often assume that you can\u2019t cheat if you\u2019re in a polyamorous relationship, but in the piece you really lay out that cheating does exist. Can you talk about what it means to cheat in a relationship where you have multiple partners?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"Absolutely, and I think this really illustrates the core of the focus on ethics and polyamory that yes, you can absolutely cheat. Just because you have multiple partners does not mean that anything goes and you can just do whatever you want all the time. Like I said, the focus is really on informed consent of all parties involved, so that means a really intense labor going into keeping open communication and making sure everybody is informed, right? That\u2019s the heart of it."},{"author":"","text":"So if somebody is not keeping their partner informed about what they\u2019re doing or they do something that\u2019s contrary to what they agreed upon, then that would classify as cheating, and within polyamory that\u2019s seen as absolutely unethical, just like it would be in monogamy."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I thought it was interesting, I think it was a woman in the piece, her [partner], I believe, had other partners outside of their marriage, but he was also meeting with the neighbor, and she didn\u2019t know about the neighbor, and that\u2019s cheating."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Exactly, that she knew about his other partners, and he knew about her other partners but then found out that he had had something going on with the neighbor, and that had not been disclosed, so that was cheating, yes."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"It\u2019s interesting that even in the context of a relationship where you\u2019re allowed to have partners outside of that relationship someone would choose to hide it."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s a really curious thing, right? And it suggests the act of cheating or dishonesty is certainly about something other than just freedom to have sex with someone because they have that opportunity, so there\u2019s something else going on there that has led to the secrecy and the lying, and so that\u2019s really where the issue lies."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I think one of the things that I thought was really interesting in the piece, one of the things that was discussed is that some people who are attracted to polyamory, it\u2019s coming from a place of wanting kind of full autonomy. And I thought that was interesting because so much of how we discuss relationships is often about having to give up some of that autonomy, and I was wondering about that tension."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Yeah, that is a tension, I think, that we all experience in any kind of relationship that we might be in, right? Like, how are we in connection with someone else but retaining our own sense of autonomy or individuality? And I think, you know, in polyamory it\u2019s a little bit of a different set of issues involved, that on the one hand a person has autonomy\u2014all people, ideally, in a polyamorous situation have autonomy to choose to engage or not engage in any relationship or any activity at any time."},{"author":"","text":"And I think what\u2019s\u2014partially what\u2019s different about that in the monogamy is there\u2019s this kind of presumption in our culture and in our history that once you are partnered with someone, especially if you are legally married to that person, there\u2019s an expectation that you are giving up some of that autonomy, anyway, to be part of this relationship."},{"author":"","text":"And in polyamory it\u2019s just very different. Everybody retains their sense of autonomy, but any connection or relationship they build, it\u2019s something that\u2019s negotiated within each situation, as opposed to, you know, \u201cNow we\u2019re married and so we both expect each other to be, you know, sexually exclusive.\u201d It\u2019s something that, that in each situation is, is negotiated anew, as opposed to having like a priori expectation based on, you know, whatever your status is."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I mean, that\u2019s a good point because I feel like one of the, the jokes that I think people often make about polyamory is sort of like, \u201cWhere do they get the energy?,\u201d that it just seems exhausting. And the piece notes that the mental and logistical work needed to keep polyamorous relationships functioning is often more significant than you would find in a monogamous relationship. And that feels like, to me anyway, for the people who are polyamorous, that for them, even though there\u2019s this kind of up-front or this extra energy in negotiating the relationships the benefits outweigh the cost."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Absolutely, and yes, there is more labor and energy that\u2019s involved because of the importance placed on open communication and, like, constantly checking in and making sure everybody\u2019s okay in a situation."},{"author":"","text":"But the way people talk about it is that that is a small price to pay for having relationships that feel mutually fulfilling, that feel expansive, that feel fresh because you\u2019re continually revisiting it and making adjustments if needed and really attending to that core foundation of the connection in a way that often in monogamous relationships kind of gets assumed that that\u2019s already been done and taken care of, and people then move on. So it is extra work, but the benefits seem to far outweigh that for people who experience themselves as polyamorous."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"One thing that I think comes up when people hear polyamory is they hear polyamory, but what they\u2019re envisioning is polygamy."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] You said that, like, so enthusiastically."},{"author":"Lester","text":"[Laughs.]Yes."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Especially if we\u2019re talking about male-female relationships, right, because there\u2014we live in a patriarchal society, so there\u2019s inherently a power dynamic there. How does polyamory differ from polygamy?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"It is radically different. So polygamy is [primarily] a religious practice that is centered on the model of one man with multiple female partners. And that is very different than polyamory, where all partners have total autonomy to date or be with whomever they choose, depending on how you negotiated and your particular constellation. But women have multiple partners, men have multiple partners, may or may not be heterosexual\u2014there\u2019s a whole range of things that happen. But it\u2019s very different than this idea that there is, you know, one man at the center around whom a group of women kind of orbit. It\u2019s a totally different power structure."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can you talk about the difference between polyamory and swinging?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"So swinging is a term that\u2019s used for a couple who has outside sexual relationships with other people, consensual\u2014it\u2019s still a form of consensual nonmonogamy, but it\u2019s purely based around sex. It\u2019s about the sex; it\u2019s about the sexual experience. And so many couples engage in that sort of thing."},{"author":"","text":"But polyamory is different than that. They do have multiple sexual partners, usually, but it\u2019s not focused around the novelty of the sexual experience. It\u2019s really about building these deeper connections."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"And you\u2019ve been digging into polyamory as an anthropologist for quite some time. Was there anything sort of really surprising to you?"},{"author":"Lester","text":"The thing that really surprised me as I started to learn about it\u2014you know, I had the same kind of misconceptions, I think, as most people do when I first started looking into this about, you know, what people were up to, why they were motivated to do it. And really what surprised me and caught my interest and motivated me to do this research was realizing how much ethics is at the center of what people are doing and this really, really careful attention to the power dynamics, to the nature of relationships and really trying to do it in a way that is respectful all around."},{"author":"","text":"And so that just surprised me. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms until I encountered it, and I realized how different that is than what the kind of notions are for people who don\u2019t have exposure to it. So that\u2019s what really motivated the research."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"If I can be so bold as to potentially be putting words in your mouth, it does seem like in some ways what you\u2019re saying, or the takeaway from the piece can be, is that even if you have no interest in polyamory that there are things that people in monogamous relationships could draw from polyamory that could potentially enrich their own relationships."},{"author":"Lester","text":"Absolutely, yes, as an anthropologist and also as a therapist one does not need to be polyamorous or have any interest or intent toward polyamory to really be able to take some powerful lessons about relationship dynamics and relationship behavior and practices from the polyamory community. I think, you know, that the kinds of skills that people build when they\u2019re really serious about doing this [in] an ethical way are skills that all of us need\u2014in any relationship we\u2019re in."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I thought that the part of the article where you were talking about how when couples or partners were experiencing discomfort that polyamorous partners would often make an effort of sort of leaning into it and having that clear and open communication and that monogamous couples often withdraw."},{"author":"Lester","text":"That\u2019s right. Because when you\u2019re in a, a situation where there are multiple partners at play you ignore problems at your own risk, you know? Like, it\u2019s dicey. It is dicey. I mean, there\u2019s emotion involved. There\u2019s all sorts of heightened feelings going on, and people are fully aware of that. And that\u2019s part of the reason why it is so crucial to talk and communicate and not let things slide and, like, really try to attend to problems that might be going on. Because if you don\u2019t, I mean, not only one relationship might get blown up, but it, it would affect a lot of people. And so it\u2019s everybody\u2019s responsibility to make sure that you\u2019re really dealing with stuff as it comes up."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today."},{"author":"Lester","text":"It\u2019s my pleasure.

And so I got very intrigued by how just up front people were, how widespread it seemed to be, and as an anthropologist I got curious about what was going on."]},{"begin":"150.960","end":"154.480","lines":["Can you give us a basic description of what polyamory is?"]},{"begin":"154.480","end":"175.040","lines":["Yeah, so polyamory is a form of what is called consensual or ethical nonmonogamy, and it is a situation where people have more than one romantic partner\u2014not just a sexual partner but an actual relationship, romantic partner\u2014and everybody in the situation is on board and consents to what\u2019s going on."]},{"begin":"175.040","end":"181.320","lines":["So the U.S. is, by and large, at least socialized to be a monogamous society ..."]},{"begin":"181.320","end":"182.760","lines":["Absolutely."]},{"begin":"182.760","end":"185.960","lines":["And we often think that there\u2019s only one true love for us out there."]},{"begin":"185.960","end":"186.320","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"186.320","end":"190.800","lines":["How do polyamorists see love and intimacy sort of differ from how we\u2019ve been socially conditioned?"]},{"begin":"190.800","end":"215.280","lines":["So in polyamory the idea is that we have many people that we can love and who can love us; there\u2019s not just one true love out there that you seek, and you find, and then you live in married bliss forever\u2014or monogamous, doesn\u2019t have to be married. But in polyamory the concept is that, as humans, we\u2019re wired to connect, we\u2019re wired to love, we\u2019re wired to receive love and that that can take all sorts of different forms with different people."]},{"begin":"215.280","end":"225.240","lines":["Can we talk a little bit about how polyamory is perceived in popular culture and then talk about sort of, how you highlight in the piece, the lived reality kind of contrasts with that?"]},{"begin":"225.240","end":"251.680","lines":["In popular culture the perceptions of polyamory generally are fairly negative, especially, you know, as it\u2019s grown in popularity and had portrayals on different media and things like that. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit well with our common understandings of what relationships, quote, unquote, should be, right? This idea that you\u2019re not just monogamous with one partner, but you have many partners is usually seen as something unethical in our society, right?"]},{"begin":"251.680","end":"276.600","lines":["And so that kind of framework is placed on polyamory as well, whereas in reality it\u2019s very different than the way that most people think about it. The people that I spoke with and that I, that I know in this world, ethics is really at the heart of what they\u2019re doing, and so they take it very, very seriously that everybody be thoroughly informed and thoroughly consent to any arrangements that are happening."]},{"begin":"276.600","end":"291.000","lines":["And so that\u2019s really different than the perception that it\u2019s just an excuse to cheat or it\u2019s a way to sneak around or whatever the case may be\u2014just get sex with different people. Like, it\u2019s very different than that, and unfortunately, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s often portrayed."]},{"begin":"291.000","end":"303.760","lines":["People often assume that you can\u2019t cheat if you\u2019re in a polyamorous relationship, but in the piece you really lay out that cheating does exist. Can you talk about what it means to cheat in a relationship where you have multiple partners?"]},{"begin":"303.760","end":"332.920","lines":["Absolutely, and I think this really illustrates the core of the focus on ethics and polyamory that yes, you can absolutely cheat. Just because you have multiple partners does not mean that anything goes and you can just do whatever you want all the time. Like I said, the focus is really on informed consent of all parties involved, so that means a really intense labor going into keeping open communication and making sure everybody is informed, right? That\u2019s the heart of it."]},{"begin":"332.920","end":"349.240","lines":["So if somebody is not keeping their partner informed about what they\u2019re doing or they do something that\u2019s contrary to what they agreed upon, then that would classify as cheating, and within polyamory that\u2019s seen as absolutely unethical, just like it would be in monogamy."]},{"begin":"349.240","end":"362.320","lines":["I thought it was interesting, I think it was a woman in the piece, her [partner], I believe, had other partners outside of their marriage, but he was also meeting with the neighbor, and she didn\u2019t know about the neighbor, and that\u2019s cheating."]},{"begin":"362.320","end":"372.880","lines":["Exactly, that she knew about his other partners, and he knew about her other partners but then found out that he had had something going on with the neighbor, and that had not been disclosed, so that was cheating, yes."]},{"begin":"372.880","end":"380.640","lines":["It\u2019s interesting that even in the context of a relationship where you\u2019re allowed to have partners outside of that relationship someone would choose to hide it."]},{"begin":"380.640","end":"397.400","lines":["Yeah, that\u2019s a really curious thing, right? And it suggests the act of cheating or dishonesty is certainly about something other than just freedom to have sex with someone because they have that opportunity, so there\u2019s something else going on there that has led to the secrecy and the lying, and so that\u2019s really where the issue lies."]},{"begin":"397.400","end":"419.880","lines":["I think one of the things that I thought was really interesting in the piece, one of the things that was discussed is that some people who are attracted to polyamory, it\u2019s coming from a place of wanting kind of full autonomy. And I thought that was interesting because so much of how we discuss relationships is often about having to give up some of that autonomy, and I was wondering about that tension."]},{"begin":"419.880","end":"447.040","lines":["Yeah, that is a tension, I think, that we all experience in any kind of relationship that we might be in, right? Like, how are we in connection with someone else but retaining our own sense of autonomy or individuality? And I think, you know, in polyamory it\u2019s a little bit of a different set of issues involved, that on the one hand a person has autonomy\u2014all people, ideally, in a polyamorous situation have autonomy to choose to engage or not engage in any relationship or any activity at any time."]},{"begin":"447.040","end":"464.520","lines":["And I think what\u2019s\u2014partially what\u2019s different about that in the monogamy is there\u2019s this kind of presumption in our culture and in our history that once you are partnered with someone, especially if you are legally married to that person, there\u2019s an expectation that you are giving up some of that autonomy, anyway, to be part of this relationship."]},{"begin":"464.520","end":"491.360","lines":["And in polyamory it\u2019s just very different. Everybody retains their sense of autonomy, but any connection or relationship they build, it\u2019s something that\u2019s negotiated within each situation, as opposed to, you know, \u201cNow we\u2019re married and so we both expect each other to be, you know, sexually exclusive.\u201d It\u2019s something that, that in each situation is, is negotiated anew, as opposed to having like a priori expectation based on, you know, whatever your status is."]},{"begin":"491.360","end":"523.280","lines":["I mean, that\u2019s a good point because I feel like one of the, the jokes that I think people often make about polyamory is sort of like, \u201cWhere do they get the energy?,\u201d that it just seems exhausting. And the piece notes that the mental and logistical work needed to keep polyamorous relationships functioning is often more significant than you would find in a monogamous relationship. And that feels like, to me anyway, for the people who are polyamorous, that for them, even though there\u2019s this kind of up-front or this extra energy in negotiating the relationships the benefits outweigh the cost."]},{"begin":"523.280","end":"534.960","lines":["Absolutely, and yes, there is more labor and energy that\u2019s involved because of the importance placed on open communication and, like, constantly checking in and making sure everybody\u2019s okay in a situation."]},{"begin":"534.960","end":"568.920","lines":["But the way people talk about it is that that is a small price to pay for having relationships that feel mutually fulfilling, that feel expansive, that feel fresh because you\u2019re continually revisiting it and making adjustments if needed and really attending to that core foundation of the connection in a way that often in monogamous relationships kind of gets assumed that that\u2019s already been done and taken care of, and people then move on. So it is extra work, but the benefits seem to far outweigh that for people who experience themselves as polyamorous."]},{"begin":"568.920","end":"576.800","lines":["One thing that I think comes up when people hear polyamory is they hear polyamory, but what they\u2019re envisioning is polygamy."]},{"begin":"576.800","end":"576.840","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"576.840","end":"579.720","lines":["[Laughs.] You said that, like, so enthusiastically."]},{"begin":"579.720","end":"580.960","lines":["[Laughs.]Yes."]},{"begin":"580.960","end":"592.920","lines":["Especially if we\u2019re talking about male-female relationships, right, because there\u2014we live in a patriarchal society, so there\u2019s inherently a power dynamic there. How does polyamory differ from polygamy?"]},{"begin":"592.920","end":"631.040","lines":["It is radically different. So polygamy is [primarily] a religious practice that is centered on the model of one man with multiple female partners. And that is very different than polyamory, where all partners have total autonomy to date or be with whomever they choose, depending on how you negotiated and your particular constellation. But women have multiple partners, men have multiple partners, may or may not be heterosexual\u2014there\u2019s a whole range of things that happen. But it\u2019s very different than this idea that there is, you know, one man at the center around whom a group of women kind of orbit. It\u2019s a totally different power structure."]},{"begin":"631.040","end":"634.320","lines":["Can you talk about the difference between polyamory and swinging?"]},{"begin":"634.320","end":"653.320","lines":["So swinging is a term that\u2019s used for a couple who has outside sexual relationships with other people, consensual\u2014it\u2019s still a form of consensual nonmonogamy, but it\u2019s purely based around sex. It\u2019s about the sex; it\u2019s about the sexual experience. And so many couples engage in that sort of thing."]},{"begin":"653.320","end":"663.600","lines":["But polyamory is different than that. They do have multiple sexual partners, usually, but it\u2019s not focused around the novelty of the sexual experience. It\u2019s really about building these deeper connections."]},{"begin":"663.600","end":"671.720","lines":["And you\u2019ve been digging into polyamory as an anthropologist for quite some time. Was there anything sort of really surprising to you?"]},{"begin":"671.720","end":"702.800","lines":["The thing that really surprised me as I started to learn about it\u2014you know, I had the same kind of misconceptions, I think, as most people do when I first started looking into this about, you know, what people were up to, why they were motivated to do it. And really what surprised me and caught my interest and motivated me to do this research was realizing how much ethics is at the center of what people are doing and this really, really careful attention to the power dynamics, to the nature of relationships and really trying to do it in a way that is respectful all around."]},{"begin":"702.800","end":"715.400","lines":["And so that just surprised me. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms until I encountered it, and I realized how different that is than what the kind of notions are for people who don\u2019t have exposure to it. So that\u2019s what really motivated the research."]},{"begin":"715.400","end":"735.520","lines":["If I can be so bold as to potentially be putting words in your mouth, it does seem like in some ways what you\u2019re saying, or the takeaway from the piece can be, is that even if you have no interest in polyamory that there are things that people in monogamous relationships could draw from polyamory that could potentially enrich their own relationships."]},{"begin":"735.520","end":"763.760","lines":["Absolutely, yes, as an anthropologist and also as a therapist one does not need to be polyamorous or have any interest or intent toward polyamory to really be able to take some powerful lessons about relationship dynamics and relationship behavior and practices from the polyamory community. I think, you know, that the kinds of skills that people build when they\u2019re really serious about doing this [in] an ethical way are skills that all of us need\u2014in any relationship we\u2019re in."]},{"begin":"763.760","end":"780.400","lines":["I thought that the part of the article where you were talking about how when couples or partners were experiencing discomfort that polyamorous partners would often make an effort of sort of leaning into it and having that clear and open communication and that monogamous couples often withdraw."]},{"begin":"780.400","end":"819.840","lines":["That\u2019s right. Because when you\u2019re in a, a situation where there are multiple partners at play you ignore problems at your own risk, you know? Like, it\u2019s dicey. It is dicey. I mean, there\u2019s emotion involved. There\u2019s all sorts of heightened feelings going on, and people are fully aware of that. And that\u2019s part of the reason why it is so crucial to talk and communicate and not let things slide and, like, really try to attend to problems that might be going on. Because if you don\u2019t, I mean, not only one relationship might get blown up, but it, it would affect a lot of people. And so it\u2019s everybody\u2019s responsibility to make sure that you\u2019re really dealing with stuff as it comes up."]},{"begin":"819.840","end":"823.280","lines":["Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today."]},{"begin":"823.280","end":"825.720","lines":["It\u2019s my pleasure.
