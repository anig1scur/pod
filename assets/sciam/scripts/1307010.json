      "text": " Back in 2011 I gave a short talk at a journalism conference about what I had learned from hate mail. The bottom line, I said, was that if you tell people that they\u2019re wrong about something they hold dear, they will immediately get defensive. And if you\u2019re a journalist like me, they will send you nasty letters like the ones you heard at the top of the show. I based my argument on my own personal experience having written about things like climate change and cancer screening and, most controversially, the uselessness of multivitamins. But I also backed it up with science\u2014specifically, some research by Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. Here\u2019s how I explained it in the talk: Here\u2019s Brendan Nyhan."

And, well..., there really wasn\u2019t better evidence, right? This was the study I\u2019d conducted. And I reported what I found. And I described my best interpretation of it from a scientific perspective."

The human brain doesn\u2019t think in data; we think in stories. So he and his colleagues did what all scientists do\u2014they created a story to explain their data. To do that, they had to do some interpretation and bring human judgment to bear. Let\u2019s listen again to what Brendan said a moment ago:"

      "text": "Notice that? He said \u201cpeople might be thinking about reasons they held the belief.\u201d Because he\u2019s a careful scientist, Brendan was cautious here to say that this is a possible explanation. But it\u2019s really just a guess, and he\u2019s pretty careful not to overstate it. Whether or not the result itself holds up, this explanation of it is a hypothesis. We can think of it as a \u201cjust-so story.\u201d Rudyard Kipling\u2019s classic collection of Just So Stories For Little Children provides fanciful explanations for things like how leopards got their spots and how camels got their humps. Just-so stories are tales invented to explain observed phenomena, just like the explanations scientists present for their scientific results are invented to explain the data. Until they\u2019re tested, these stories are just best guesses. But because these explanations are created to perfectly fit the data, it\u2019s easy to jump on the story and forget about all the uncertainty that surrounds it. As it turns out, the backfire effect is a classic case of a very exciting first finding that we all jump on, and then, poof, it disappears in later studies. Of course, it\u2019s important to note that only two of the five original experiments found any evidence of the backfire effect. So there was a lot of uncertainty about it from the very first study."

You were presented with evidence that your original finding on the backfire effect might not hold up, and instead of doubling down, you\u2019ve actually opened up and said, \u201cWait a second; let\u2019s revisit this.

One thing that\u2019s become clear to me is that it\u2019s really easy to get a result. You did a study, and you found this thing. It\u2019s a lot harder to get an answer to the underlying question. When I was giving that talk about the backfire effect, I was trying to explain why people resist changing their beliefs when they are offered a correction. I really wanted a universal answer. But that\u2019s asking for a lot. Were we expecting too much from the backfire effect?"

The notion that I have to be right means that I need to take a defensive tact when you find a flaw. The prioritization of getting it right means that if you say: \u201cI think I see something wrong with your research,\u201d I should say: \u201cReally? What is it? Tell me because my goal is to make sure it is right.\u201d On the next episode of Uncertain, we\u2019ll talk to scientists who are working on being less wrong. Uncertain is produced by me, Christie Aschwanden, and Jeff DelViscio. Our series art is by Annaissa Ruiz Tejada. Our music is from Epidemic Sound. Funding for this series was provided by UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center\u2013it\u2019s part of the Expanding Awareness of the Science of Intellectual Humility Initiative, which is supported by the John Templeton Foundation. This is Uncertain, a podcast from Scientific American. Thanks for listening. Listen to the second episode of Uncertain. Listen to the fourth episode of Uncertain. "
