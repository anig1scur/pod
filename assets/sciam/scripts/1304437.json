We\u2019ve been digging into different aspects of love, and today we\u2019re going to leave people behind to ponder if animals feel love\u2014and if how we answer that question tells us anything about the way we see nonhuman animals and what love is at all.

There could be a reluctance to say animals experience love just like humans, but there could be a similar reluctance to noticing how human love can be animalistic, too."
