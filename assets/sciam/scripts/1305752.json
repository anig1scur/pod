It was this sense of possibility at that very moment. Then, at some point, he had to say, \u201cWanda, you have to go to your house.

There\u2019s no textbooks available for us. A textbook in astrophysics is like gold dust. It\u2019s like a diamond. It\u2019s like platinum, a yellow diamond this size of my fist. The scientific revolution developed in a way that just assumed that we wouldn\u2019t participate. It just developed in a way until it got to the point that we had no ways.
