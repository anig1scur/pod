She works at the most famous particle accelerators in the world. But for all that she\u2019s accomplished, she\u2019s quite humble.

But to me, the only scientists in the universe were medicine doctors. Studying science meant that you would become a doctor."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Wanda was diagnosed with diabetes pretty early in childhood and then later with diabetic retinopathy. This can cause blindness in people with diabetes. So when she was in her early 20s in college, her vision started to go."},{"author":"D\u00edaz-Merced","text":"The condition continued deteriorating until the point when I couldn\u2019t orientate anymore. I needed help. I used to, like, stay in one place all day and not move from there.

And then he said, \u201cNo, no, no, Wandita. That is waiting to see if there is any solar emissions.\u201d And then he says that my eyes got big! Like, my, my face changed. And I, yes\u2014I heard it! Yes, yes! It was this sense of possibility at that very moment. Then, at some point, he had to say, \u201cWanda, you have to go to your house."},{"author":"D\u00edaz-Merced","text":"You cannot stay here until tomorrow just sitting by that thing, listening to it.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to detach from it.

She worked with the Radio JOVE project, made her way to NASA and completed a Ph.D. Using sonifications, she has even made discoveries that sighted astronomers have missed. [CLIP: Wanda's sonification of supernova explosions] Wanda found that star formation can affect supernovae, which suggests that these explosions are not only dependent on the mass of their host star. Converting the data into sound helped uncover the drop in volume that led to the discovery."},{"author":"D\u00edaz-Merced","text":"How do I say, I discovered my ability to listen to the data, to listen to, as you call it\u2014I love the way you call it\u2014to listen to the universe, to the phenomena that have been seen in the interstellar medium. There\u2019s no textbooks available for us. A textbook in astrophysics is like gold dust. It\u2019s like a diamond. It\u2019s like platinum, a yellow diamond this size of my fist. The scientific revolution developed in a way that just assumed that we wouldn\u2019t participate."},{"author":"D\u00edaz-Merced","text":"It just developed in a way until it got to the point that we had no ways.

He was not born blind, but a disease called retinitis pigmentosa has made his vision progressively cloudier.

Other astronomers are ..."},{"author":"P\u00e9rez-Montero","text":"Distracted by the beauty of the images. They can get wrong conclusions, maybe because they are just seeing an image. And they are not objectively analyzing what\u2019s the content of the information. And this is one thing I can do because I\u2019m just simply listening: What is the trend of the data, of the very simple cold data, read by my computer?"},{"author":"Broderick","text":"How we choose to represent data can have far-reaching consequences. Astronomy has been associated with sight for centuries, but that does not mean the sense is necessary or even the most useful tool to do the job. It\u2019s ultimately arbitrary, Enrique says."},{"author":"P\u00e9rez-Montero","text":"Ninety-nine percent of the energy and the matter of the universe cannot be seen at all. We can see them because people working with simulations [are] putting out this stuff about dark matter and dark energy. But, of course, this cannot be seen at all, and we can translate it to other ways than images. Images are not the main source to get information about what is the true nature of our universe.
