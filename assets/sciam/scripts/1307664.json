But this isn\u2019t actually the first time debates over biological sex have caused controversy and exclusion in the sports world. Even athletes who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, meaning people with XX chromosomes who were assigned female at birth and identify as women today, can find themselves banned from elite competition on the basis of their biology. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today I\u2019m talking to award-winning reporter and writer Rose Eveleth. They\u2019re the creator and host of a new series called Tested, co-produced by CBC Podcasts and NPR\u2019s Embedded. Tested follows the surprising 100-year history of sex testing in elite sports, which has culminated in some shocking modern policies. So, Rose, for listeners who aren\u2019t familiar with your work, I would love to hear a little bit more about how you came to this story."},{"author":"Rose Eveleth","text":"I was an intern in the ye olde days of Scientific American."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"As was I! What a time."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Yeah, in the blog minds of early science Internet. But so I was an intern at Scientific American, and I was looking for something to write about, and I had been writing a lot about prosthetics because, you know, when you\u2019re an intern you say yes to literally anything anyone gives you to write. And as I was looking for something to write about, I came across the story of Oscar Pistorius, who is a South African man who is a double amputee and who, at the time, was actually trying to race against able-bodied runners, and this was a big controversy because, you know, there was this question of, \u201cDoes he have an unfair advantage because his legs are so light and he might actually be able to run faster than someone who has full legs?\u201d And I found that super interesting \u2019cause I was like, okay, what do we mean when we say an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in sports? And it seems a little bit counterintuitive, perhaps, to think that, like, a double amputee has an unfair advantage in running."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Like, that\u2019s sort of an interesting, like, you know, thing to think about. And also, how would you even test that? And so I was reading about that, and I came across some other precedent about a different South African runner named Caster Semenya, who in 2009 broke onto the world stage and was very publicly questioned about her sex and was told that she also had an unfair advantage because of her body\u2019s biology. And I had heard about Caster when this all happened in 2009, but, like, I didn\u2019t really follow it \u2019cause honestly I remember seeing the headlines and being like, \u201cWhat? Like, this doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d But in, I think it was 2012, I started really researching it, and I was like, \u201cWhoa, there\u2019s this really long history. There\u2019s 100 years of sort of sex-testing policies.\u201d And then, as I\u2019ve been following it, those policies have changed over time and are still active."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So looking back at the Olympics specifically, since \u2019tis the season, what did you learn about how these questions sort of, like, first arose?"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Yeah, so one of the really interesting things that I learned when I started researching this is that questions about the true sex or true gender of women in the Olympics happened immediately. In 1928 it was the first year that women are allowed to run track at the Olympics. They had been allowed in other events before that that were deemed more feminine\u2014so, like, swimming and tennis\u2014but track and field, absolutely not until 1928. And immediately you hear the press, you hear sports officials saying, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with these women.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"It sounds like at that time it was more like, \u201cIs it inherently unwomaning to be in sports?\u201d [Laughs]"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"I mean, they genuinely believed that these women could turn themselves into men if they competed too much in athletics, l ike, that was an actual thing that they believed."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Now we have this ... very problematic idea around, like, a very rigid sex binary, right? That there\u2019s, like, XX, XY, like, you know, biological male, biological female \u2026"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"\u2026 which obviously is not actually how humans are [laughs], you know, distributed\u2014in this clear bimodal situation\u2014but at the time they did not have that, right? At the time there was not this very clear sense of a very rigid sex binary. At the time the dominant idea\u2014at least in the West: sort of Europe and the United States\u2014was this idea called balance theory \u2026"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"\u2026 which was that every person was born with a certain amount of, like, male and female stuff inside of them and you could be, like, a 65 percent woman or a 99 percent woman, and that if you did certain things, that balance could shift. So you could actually turn yourself into a man if you did manly things like participate in sports, especially if you were already kind of, like, a cuspy woman, you know [laughs], which I feel like is actually, weirdly enough, maybe closer to reality in terms of, like, the spectrum of sex characteristics that exist ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"But is not also correct [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, right. It\u2019s still, it\u2019s still wrong, but it\u2019s\u2014I\u2019d love to, like, kind of go back to that drawing board and pick up a little bit of what they were putting down. Yeah, you know, when you hear politicians today be like, \u201cWe used to know there were only two sexes; you know, now people are so confused,\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cActually, listen, it\u2019s always been confusing, man.\u201d [laughs]"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"The whole time, yeah. Yeah, being a human, I think, is just inherently confusing in so many ways ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"[Laughs] But, yeah, they really thought that these women were either really borderline cases, is what they would often say, or potentially gonna turn themselves into men, and so they decided that there needed to be rules and regulations to kind of test and check. And it all comes from a very paternalistic sense of like, \u201cWe need to protect these women from themselves because clearly no true woman would want to compete in athletics. That\u2019s, like, sort of not correct in some way.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So how did that shift over time?"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Yeah, so 1928 you immediately get people being like, \u201cThat\u2019s not a woman. That\u2019s not a woman.\u201d [Laughs] You know, like, you hear people talk about Hitomi Kinue, who is a Japanese runner, and in the newspapers they say, you know, \u201cShe has all the power of a halfback. She should be playing for the Chicago Bears,\u201d is a thing that they actually printed about this woman\u2014which is also very funny, looking at it now, \u2019cause you, you know, you see photographs of these women, who are being described as, like, absolute units, and they just look like regular people ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Like, we look at athletes today, right, they\u2019re, like, incredibly jacked ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, but ..."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Like, it\u2019s 1928 ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Because they\u2019re not actively fainting, they\u2019re [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"[Laughs] Right, exactly. And so it\u2019s so funny just, like, how that line has shifted, but in 1936 the first official policy in that regard is passed by the International Amateur Athletic Federation [IAAF], which is now known as World Athletics, the governing body of track and field. And that policy allows them to pull aside any suspicious female, and they don\u2019t really say what warrants suspicion\u2014it\u2019s sort of a very, like, \u201cyou\u2019ll know it when you see it\u201d kind of situation. And the policy allows for an examination of that athlete, so that would be a nude inspection."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"There are some intervening years where you have instructions like, \u201cWe really want you to go to your doctor and get examined and bring a little, like, note\u2014like a doctor\u2019s note that says, like, \u2018diagnosed female,\u2019\u201d or whatever [laughs], you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yikes, wow."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Yeah, and then in 1966 they decide that doing this on a case-by-case basis, or sort of this ad hoc kind of way, is not good; we need to do it to all women. And they institute what are now known as the \u201cnude parades,\u201d also sometimes known as the \u201cpeek and poke\u201d tests, which were: every woman who competed in track and field had to go into a room and get naked in front of a panel\u2014sometimes one person, sometimes more than one\u2014to be confirmed that their body looked correct for a woman."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, gosh."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"In 1968 they switch, and they change the policy, and they go to a chromosome test. And from 1968 to 1999, which is a very long period of time, every single woman who competed in the Olympics had to take a sex test, a chromosome-based sex test, and get a certificate of femininity that looks a little bit like your driver\u2019s license and bring it with you\u2014everywhere you go, whenever you compete. And that lasts until 1999. And the thing that\u2019s really interesting about this period of time is that immediately\u2014like, as soon as the IOC [International Olympic Committee] and the IAAF start using these tests\u2014you have doctors and scientists being like, \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, hold on\u2014this won\u2019t do any of the things that you say it\u2019s going to do. It will not necessarily catch all men who try to enter a women\u2019s competition because some men can have XX chromosomes. All you\u2019re going to do is catch women who have no idea there\u2019s anything different about them, who have shown up to the Olympics, trained their whole lives to compete and all of a sudden are gonna be told, \u2018Actually, surprise, you\u2019re not a woman, and you need to leave.\u2019\u201d You know, there was a 30-year campaign by these scientists to write to the IOC, to write to World Athletics and be like, \u201cGuys, like, don\u2019t do this. This doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not scientifically sound.\u201d The guy whose test they were using wrote to the IOC and the IAAF, being like, \u201cPlease stop doing this,\u201d and they were like, \u201cNo thanks,\u201d [laughs] you know? When asked about it they basically say, like, \u201cLook, I understand that you scientists in your labs have this way of thinking about things, but this is sports, and we do things our own way here.\u201d And that was really, basically, the answer for 30 years, and it took a ton of work to try and convince these organizations to drop these tests."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I can just kind of imagine someone being like, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t like it when we poked them and made them get naked. What do you want?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear what we want; we want ...\""},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Just maybe don\u2019t\u2014yeah."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But okay\u2014yeah, just don\u2019t. And just to contextualize for listeners who might not be familiar with this topic, what are we talking about when we talk about intersex conditions, and how common are those variations?"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"Intersex is largely an identity, right, like queer that someone kind of opts into, that they say, like, \u201cYes, I am a part of this.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"There is the more medicalizing \u201cdifferences of sex development,\u201d or DSD. A lot of intersex folks don\u2019t like that term because it is medicalizing, and they sort of say, like, \u201cWell, there\u2019s actually nothing wrong with me; I\u2019m just, you know\u2014there\u2019s just this variation.\u201d I tend to use sort of maybe a clunkier phrase of just, like, \u201cpeople with sex variation,\u201d or, like, \u201cpeople with variations in their sex biology.\u201d It\u2019s also really hard to know how common this is because it sort of depends on how you define it. And also, in a lot of parts of the world, this is not documented; people aren\u2019t putting this into charts and stuff like that. So some experts estimate that the frequency, sort of broadly defined, of sex variations in the population is between one and two percent. So it\u2019s more common than identical twins.... It's not this incredibly rare thing that, like, only happens in these, like, super outlier situations."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So do we have any sense of how many people were impacted by this?"},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"We don\u2019t know how many women showed up to the Olympics or to the world championships or to, you know, a world athletics event, given this test and were told, \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d The Olympics and the IAAF both were quite secretive about it in the sense that they did not share numbers, they did not share names\u2014and, you know, in some ways you want that, right? You don\u2019t want to be outing people against their will about their biology. The problem is that if you are an elite athlete, and you show up to a competition, you know pretty much everyone you\u2019re gonna be competing against, right? At this point you\u2019ve been competing against them for years, probably. And so if someone shows up to the Olympics and then all of a sudden, like, doesn\u2019t compete, it\u2019s actually quite obvious, like, \u201cWell, wait, what happened?\u201d And so they often were told to fake an injury. And they would, like, put a cast on somebody and have them, like, pretend to be injured. So we really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard a lot of different estimates. We\u2019re not talking about thousands of people here, right? You know, I\u2019ve seen people estimate that something like a handful every Olympics between 1966 and 1988. And we also don\u2019t know how many people decided to stop showing up, right? And so there were women who were terrified they were gonna fail these tests. We talked to one of them who actually paid for her own test before she went because she was so afraid she was gonna fail it. You know, she\u2019s heard all her life that, like, \u201cMm, you\u2019re maybe kind of a boy.\u201d And, like, she was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe I am. Like, I have no idea.\u201d And so I think that\u2019s the other thing\u2014is, like, we know that a handful every Olympics were sent home, but we don\u2019t know how many people sort of opted out entirely."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what\u2019s the situation today? You know, for the 2024 Olympics, how are they factoring this stuff in? I would love to assume they\u2019re not; I feel like that\u2019s probably not the case [laughs]."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"No, unfortunately. The International Olympic Committee, the IOC, they have said that there should not be policies that restrict people\u2019s participation based on their sex biology."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Eveleth","text":"But they are actually not in charge of those policies; the different federations are. So you have: World Aquatics is the swimming one. World Athletics is the track-and-field one, right? Every sport has its own federation. And they\u2019re actually the ones who decide the rules of the sport and who gets to compete. And different federations have different takes on this. Many federations just let people compete, right? But some don\u2019t. World Athletics, for example, does have a policy on the books\u2014what they call DSD eligibility policies. And the situation today is that if you are an athlete who has one of their defined DSD conditions\u2014so they have a list of which ones count, and essentially it\u2019s ones that offer you a high level of testosterone that your body can use\u2014if you have one of these regulated ... DSDs, that means that you do have to manipulate your body\u2019s biology in order to lower your testosterone level down to a certain point: 2.5 nanomoles per liter. There are two main ways you would do that. One of them is surgery. Some folks have internal gonads that produce high levels of testosterone, so you\u2019d have to do surgery to remove those. That requires, basically, being on hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It\u2019s obviously a permanent change. The other option is to take medications to lower that testosterone level, and that\u2019s generally a combination of sort of an estrogen and an inhibitor drug that blocks testosterone. These are drugs that are often provided as gender-affirming care to trans youth to kind of stop puberty. They are not intended to lower [the testosterone level of] an adult woman who has a DSDs testosterone level. We don\u2019t actually have a great sense of what the side effects are gonna be for some of these people. It\u2019s sort of a big experiment because the World Medical Association, for example, has come out saying, like, \u201cThis is medically unethical. You should not be requiring people to take drugs to manipulate their biology so that they can compete in the sex category that they already occupy.\u201d But because these federations are essentially independent bodies based internationally, there\u2019s not a lot of accountability. There was a case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport about this that Caster Semenya ruled on in 2019. And they agreed with the World Athletics. They said, \u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s okay for you to have these policies.\u201d So currently there are women who would love to be in Paris but are not because they can\u2019t compete unless they manipulate their bodies in this way. Some of them have opted to try it. None of them were able to get their levels down and get their training back into place in time for Paris for this year. And some of them are saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna do that.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s expensive. Often these women are international, and they don\u2019t have a lot of resources. They don\u2019t have a doctor to prescribe this to them. They don\u2019t even know what drugs would be required. It\u2019s a lot of stuff to go through. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at currently. We are not gonna see a couple of athletes who, for example, were in the final in Tokyo last Olympics."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"If you wanna hear more about the history of sex testing in sports and how it\u2019s impacting the 2024 Olympics in Paris, check out Tested wherever you listen to your podcasts.

And also, in a lot of parts of the world, this is not documented; people aren\u2019t putting this into charts and stuff like that. So some experts estimate that the frequency, sort of broadly defined, of sex variations in the population is between one and two percent. So it\u2019s more common than identical twins.... It's not this incredibly rare thing that, like, only happens in these, like, super outlier situations."]},{"begin":"650.080","end":"655.840","lines":["So do we have any sense of how many people were impacted by this?"]},{"begin":"655.840","end":"744.280","lines":["We don\u2019t know how many women showed up to the Olympics or to the world championships or to, you know, a world athletics event, given this test and were told, \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d The Olympics and the IAAF both were quite secretive about it in the sense that they did not share numbers, they did not share names\u2014and, you know, in some ways you want that, right? You don\u2019t want to be outing people against their will about their biology. The problem is that if you are an elite athlete, and you show up to a competition, you know pretty much everyone you\u2019re gonna be competing against, right? At this point you\u2019ve been competing against them for years, probably. And so if someone shows up to the Olympics and then all of a sudden, like, doesn\u2019t compete, it\u2019s actually quite obvious, like, \u201cWell, wait, what happened?\u201d And so they often were told to fake an injury. And they would, like, put a cast on somebody and have them, like, pretend to be injured. So we really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard a lot of different estimates. We\u2019re not talking about thousands of people here, right? You know, I\u2019ve seen people estimate that something like a handful every Olympics between 1966 and 1988. And we also don\u2019t know how many people decided to stop showing up, right? And so there were women who were terrified they were gonna fail these tests. We talked to one of them who actually paid for her own test before she went because she was so afraid she was gonna fail it. You know, she\u2019s heard all her life that, like, \u201cMm, you\u2019re maybe kind of a boy.\u201d And, like, she was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe I am. Like, I have no idea.\u201d And so I think that\u2019s the other thing\u2014is, like, we know that a handful every Olympics were sent home, but we don\u2019t know how many people sort of opted out entirely."]},{"begin":"744.280","end":"754.520","lines":["So what\u2019s the situation today?

So you have: World Aquatics is the swimming one. World Athletics is the track-and-field one, right? Every sport has its own federation. And they\u2019re actually the ones who decide the rules of the sport and who gets to compete. And different federations have different takes on this. Many federations just let people compete, right? But some don\u2019t. World Athletics, for example, does have a policy on the books\u2014what they call DSD eligibility policies. And the situation today is that if you are an athlete who has one of their defined DSD conditions\u2014so they have a list of which ones count, and essentially it\u2019s ones that offer you a high level of testosterone that your body can use\u2014if you have one of these regulated ... DSDs, that means that you do have to manipulate your body\u2019s biology in order to lower your testosterone level down to a certain point: 2.5 nanomoles per liter. There are two main ways you would do that. One of them is surgery. Some folks have internal gonads that produce high levels of testosterone, so you\u2019d have to do surgery to remove those. That requires, basically, being on hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It\u2019s obviously a permanent change. The other option is to take medications to lower that testosterone level, and that\u2019s generally a combination of sort of an estrogen and an inhibitor drug that blocks testosterone. These are drugs that are often provided as gender-affirming care to trans youth to kind of stop puberty. They are not intended to lower [the testosterone level of] an adult woman who has a DSDs testosterone level. We don\u2019t actually have a great sense of what the side effects are gonna be for some of these people. It\u2019s sort of a big experiment because the World Medical Association, for example, has come out saying, like, \u201cThis is medically unethical. You should not be requiring people to take drugs to manipulate their biology so that they can compete in the sex category that they already occupy.\u201d But because these federations are essentially independent bodies based internationally, there\u2019s not a lot of accountability. There was a case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport about this that Caster Semenya ruled on in 2019. And they agreed with the World Athletics. They said, \u201cNo, actually, it\u2019s okay for you to have these policies.\u201d So currently there are women who would love to be in Paris but are not because they can\u2019t compete unless they manipulate their bodies in this way. Some of them have opted to try it. None of them were able to get their levels down and get their training back into place in time for Paris for this year. And some of them are saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna do that.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s expensive. Often these women are international, and they don\u2019t have a lot of resources. They don\u2019t have a doctor to prescribe this to them. They don\u2019t even know what drugs would be required. It\u2019s a lot of stuff to go through. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at currently. We are not gonna see a couple of athletes who, for example, were in the final in Tokyo last Olympics."]},{"begin":"918.840","end":"976.560","lines":["If you wanna hear more about the history of sex testing in sports and how it\u2019s impacting the 2024 Olympics in Paris, check out Tested wherever you listen to your podcasts.
