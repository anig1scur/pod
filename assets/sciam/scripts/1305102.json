But it is also showing real promise for treating intractable PTSD \u2014flashbacks, depression, and other symptoms that recur long after a traumatic event. And it might help other conditions too. The medication could soon be headed for FDA approval."

      "text": ": Josh, what do you know about MDMA?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Well, I know it got a reputation as a party drug in the 1980s, making people feel excited and giddy. That\u2019s when it got the nicknames Ecstasy and Molly. But before that, some psychiatrists were using it during talk therapy. They thought it helped patients open up in sessions."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis: ",
      "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s the gist of it. MDMA is a psychoactive drug with both stimulant and mood-enhancing effects. It appears to act by flooding the brain with the neurotransmitter serotonin, producing feelings of euphoria and affection. But that\u2019s definitely not what it was invented for. In 1912 the pharmaceutical giant Merck was trying to develop a blood-clotting agent. They came up with [three-four METHUH-LEEN-DIOXY-METHAMPHETAMINE] 3,4-Methyl\u200benedioxy\u200bmethamphetamine.\u00a0"

    {

      "text": ": Right? And thank you so much to our show\u2019s producer, Jeff DelViscio, for forcing me to say it\u2026 But\u2026 moving on\u2026. Merck did some early experiments with MDMA in animals, but ended up shelving it because the chemicals needed to synthesize it were too expensive. But years later, when it was given to humans, the drug was found to have certain\u2026other properties. That\u2019s why it became a party drug.\u00a0 [CLIP\u00a0 \u201cThis is your brain on drugs\u201d] But in fact it was used for therapy purposes as early as the 1970s."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rachel Nuwer",
      "text": ": MDMA was resynthesized in 1968 by the psychedelic chemist Alexander Shulgin, in the Bay Area. Shulgin tried it himself in 1976, for sure. He introduced it to some therapist friends of his who spread it among all these Bay Area therapists, who in turn spread it broader outside into the United States and even other countries."

      "text": "That\u2019s Rachel Nuwer, a science journalist, author and frequent Scientific American contributor. She recently wrote a book on MDMA called \u201cI FEEL LOVE: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World.\u201d"
    },
    {
      "author": "Nuwer: ",
      "text": "And it really became this favorite therapeutic catalyst that a bunch of professionals were using, but it's also a drug that makes you feel good. And inevitably, it escaped from the therapist's office, as people like to say, onto the dance floor in the early 1980s."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": The U.S. government declared MDMA a Schedule I drug, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. And that made it a lot harder to do research on or get funding for."
    },
    {
      "author": "Nuwer: ",
      "text": "It is, like, really worth emphasizing that this started as a therapeutic drug, always paired with psychotherapy. And you know, back in the late 70s, and early 80s, scientists were starting to do some studies about it. And they were finding evidence that it could help with everything from couples counseling to substance use disorders to trauma."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman: ",
      "text": "Couples counseling is kind of a weird use, compared with trauma disorders and other stuff, isn\u2019t it?"

    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Yeah it is strange\u2014but there are stories about couples on the brink of divorce who had tried everything else and nothing worked, yet MDMA helped them reconnect. But there\u2019s not a lot of research to back up the anecdotes. There\u2019s much more research on using MDMA to treat severe PTSD. So, there's this one group that has been a real mover in the MDMA research space. It's called the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS.\u00a0 It's a nonprofit, and so far, they've funded a couple of large, late-stage clinical trials using MDMA to treat PTSD. One of these trials finished in May 2021."

      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Those are pretty impressive results, especially for people who\u2019ve struggled with PTSD for years while other treatments have failed them. It makes me wonder why this drug worked so well. What do the researchers think?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis: ",
      "text": "Some scientists think that MDMA may help reopen up what\u2019s called a \u201ccritical period\u201d in the brain, like we experience during childhood when we\u2019re learning new things. And this might allow people to engage with traumatic memories in a new light and work through them. Another important point to mention is that it\u2019s not just the drug itself that seems to help people\u2014the talk therapy is also critical. Sometimes unwanted things come up during the MDMA trip. A trained psychotherapist can help the patient integrate their experience."
    },
    {
      "author": "Nuwer: ",
      "text": "Whatever we're talking about in terms of therapeutic potential, it's MDMA-assisted therapy. I think of MDMA really as like that catalyst for therapy."

      "text": "The second large trial has now been completed, and Mithoefer says the results are very promising, too. They\u2019ve submitted them for publication. The Food and Drug Administration needs these two clinical trials in order to evaluate the drug for medical approval.

      "text": "People do die from taking too much MDMA or taking adulterated MDMA [...] In terms of MDMA itself, the most common risk is overheating. So MDMA messes with your thermal regulation, and you can get really hot on the dance floor and dehydrated and run into problems that way. There's issues of people actually drinking too much water and dying that way. Again, this is in a recreational setting. They've heard, \u201cOh, you need to drink water on MDMA,\u201d and then they just are chugging, like, liters of water in an hour, diluting their blood, and yeah, falling into a coma."

      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Yeah, it\u2019s definitely something to avoid. But remember, these were people taking the drugs in a party setting. In the controlled setting of the trial, the researchers did not see these adverse effects."

      "author": "Mithoefer",
      "text": ": In our clinical trials, we did careful screening. So the fact that we had a good safety record, people should keep in mind that these were carefully screened people medically and psychologically. We know that MDMA elevates blood pressure and pulse, kind of like moderate exercise. So that's why we do careful cardiovascular screening [\u2026] And we've excluded some psychiatric conditions too."
