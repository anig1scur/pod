My name is Brady Huggett, and I\u2019m from the journal Nature Biotechnology. We have just launched a new podcast\u2014a stand-alone series\u2014that the Science Talk editors thought might interest you. It\u2019s a 10-part show that looks at the history of the drug modality antisense, and it starts with an antisense pioneer who overcame poverty, and a rough childhood just to make something of himself. Eventually his company created the first drug to treat the leading genetic killer of babies, spinal muscular atrophy. We\u2019ve built a trailer for the show, and I\u2019d like to play that for you now. The podcast is called Hope Lies in Dreams, and the first episode launched September 8. Here you go. [Trailer]"},{"author":"Brady Huggett","text":"Stan Crooke told me something once that I've never forgotten. This was back in 2015, when I was interviewing him in a Hilton hotel, in San Francisco near Union Square. He was in San Francisco to attend a biotech conference, as CEO of a company he founded in 1989. Stan grew up destitute, in downtown Indianapolis in the \u201940s and \u201950s. An \u201cugly place,\u201d as he called it, and as we talked I asked him how he managed to overcome that neighborhood and his hard upbringing and get himself to college, and then beyond."},{"author":"Stan Crooke","text":"So, mostly desperation, and anger. And just the whole idea of having no hope, no aspirations. I mean, poverty is not the loss of money\u2014though of course that\u2019s sad. It\u2019s the loss of dreams, it\u2019s the absence of hope. That\u2019s poverty."},{"author":"Brady Huggett","text":"The absence of a real future."},{"author":"Stan Crooke: ","text":"Beyond that. At least from my perspective, it\u2019s the inability to even dream, you know?"},{"author":"Brady Huggett","text":"\u00a0 This is the story of Stan Crooke\u2019s life. It\u2019s the story of the biotech company he founded, and it\u2019s the story of a powerful drug discovery technology called antisense. Together, they cracked the degenerative disease known as spinal muscular atrophy, which had been stealing the lives of children, and traumatizing families since it was first discovered more than a century ago. From Nature Biotechnology, I\u2019m Brady Huggett, and this is Hope Lies in Dreams. [theme music, snippets of dialogue] \u201ccouldn't believe and couldn\u2019t explain and couldn\u2019t understand how this drug could had failed\u201d \u201cjust like, one of the more amazing, dramatic moments certainly of my life\u201d \u201cso I\u2019m like, I have to sit here and watch my daughter slowly waste away?

SMA, especially the infant form, is a terrible disease\u201d \u201cbut if I\u2019m telling the truth, that\u2019s the truth\u201d"},{"author":"Brady Huggett","text":"Ok, well this took more than two years for me to report and write, but I wouldn\u2019t give back a minute of that time. It\u2019s been a fascinating story to work on, and it\u2019s a story that\u2019s also been under-reported, and under-appreciated, I think. 10 chapters, one every week, and it started September 8. You can find it wherever you get your podcasts: Apple, Google, Spotify, wherever, and subscribe to it there. Just look for Hope Lies in Dreams.
