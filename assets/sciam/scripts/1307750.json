That\u2019s pretty much the point of her hit podcast Science Vs: she and her team take on fads and trends to figure out the facts. But she recently took on what might be her most taboo subject to date\u2014something that\u2019s gotten so little attention from scientists that she had to go collect data on it herself: anal sex. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today I\u2019m talking to Wendy about how her quest to break down the myths surrounding the so-called male g-spot led her to help coordinate a massive new survey on basically everything fun you can do with a butt.\u00a0"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what inspired you to create this survey, and how did you go about designing it?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"I\u2019ve been on a journey, Rachel, an, an anal-sex journey\u2014something I didn\u2019t think I would say this year, I\u2019m gonna be honest [laughs]. So the show that I make, Science Vs, the whole point of it is that we take these ideas that are in the zeitgeist, that are online, and then we, like, fact-check the hell out of them, and\u2014you know, from the serious to the perhaps seemingly trivial. And this idea came up about the male G-spot, which has been around for ages, and if you go online, like, basically every website out there, from, you know, British GQ, to, like, Healthline\u2014you know, all these, like, seemingly medical-based websites\u2014you know, everyone\u2019s like, \u201cThe male G-spot, you know, this is\u2014if you press it, you\u2019ll get the most amazing orgasms of your life.\u201d And for the uninitiated, the male G-spot is the prostate. Like, everyone\u2019s like, \u201cThe male G-spot is the prostate. If you have one,\u00a0 press it\u2014amazing orgasms.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? Is that true? Is that true? And, and am I missing out, as someone who doesn\u2019t have a prostate?\u201d was my, was my B-story. And so I thought that ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, the big, important questions [laughs]."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"[Laughs] Exactly, exactly\u2014you know, research is mesearch. And so I thought one way to answer that question is fairly simple, is you could get a bunch of people who have prostates and a bunch of people who do not have prostates and basically ask them, you know, \u201cWhen you have anal sex or penetrate yourself anally,\u201d which is\u2014for the uninitiated, that is how you would reach your prostate: you would put a finger or a penis or a toy about one or two inches up your bottom, and that\u2019s how you would press it. And so the sort of scientific question is that, like, \u201cIf you do this\u2014put a finger or a toy or a penis up your bottom for sexual pleasure\u2014is it so much better if you have a prostate? Is that experience so much greater?\u201d And I went into the scientific literature thinking that there would be something. This\u2014I mean, Rachel, we\u2019ve been science journalists for a long time. There\u2019s scientific literature on, on basically everything ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"It\u2019s true\u2014so many things that do not seem important. And it\u2019s like, \u201cGood for you. I\u2019m glad you looked into that.\u201d [Laughs]"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"\u201cGood for\u2014I appreciate you.\u201d Exactly, yes. But there was, there was nothing\u2014nothing had interrogated this, this question in this way..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"And, and even what I realized is: this whole topic of anal sex\u2014receptive anal intercourse in particular, you know, also called \u201cbottoming\u201d\u2014but this idea of, like, putting something into your bottom, that hadn\u2019t really been researched that well either. And then what it really made me realize is that this topic that I started as, like, something fun and kind of frivolous, it actually became about something more, which is, like: What kinds of sex are okay? And what kinds of sex is science allowed to study and are doctors allowed to talk about? And, and, like, anal sex had\u2014has sort of been, like, shifted off to the side as something taboo. And so then that really drove me to, to do this survey and find out, like, A: \u201cHow many people are doing this?\u201d And then, and then sort of the question of, like: \u201cDoes the male G-spot\u2014and, like, you know, how many people are enjoying it?\u201d And, and, you know, \u201cLet\u2019s, like, shed some light in the dark.\u201d And then the idea of like, \u201cOh, and by the way, does the male G-spot exist?\u201d It sort of became this always second-line story in the end."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, wow, it\u2019s\u2014you know, even having written a whole book about sex and knowing there are so many things that we should have looked into that we haven\u2019t looked into yet, it\u2019s still shocking to me that really, like, everyone was just taking this for granted. But I know that you found a couple of researchers who were ready to go deeper. Could you tell me a little bit about the, the folks you worked with in, in figuring out this survey?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yeah, absolutely, so as I was sort of realizing this, this whole point that, like, so much of, of scientific research is really focused on penis-vagina sex."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a more scientific term for that, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ll use."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019m pretty sure they do just say PIV, so ..."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"[Laughs] Right, right, there we go."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] So, no, I ..."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"[Laughs] Call a spade a spade; that\u2019s what we like to do. So I, I really\u2014where\u2014it was really interesting because two researchers from across the country in the U.S., one in New York and one in L.A., had actually started looking at this question of receptive anal intercourse just, you know, within the last several years. And they both came upon it from the same perspective.\u00a0 So both of them had been working with prostate cancer patients. And with prostate cancer, the treatment can often affect erections. And so they would be talking to their patients and asking a lot about erections. And both of them, in fact, told me this quote\u2014they were like, \u201cSo we were asking, \u2018Erections, erections, erections.\u2019\u201d So that, if you have them both side by side, that is six erections. And, and then for Dr. Dan Dickstein, who\u2019s at Mount Sinai Hospital, one of his patients asked him, \u201cWell, what about receptive anal intercourse?\u201d For him, for this patient, it wasn\u2019t that important whether he had an erection or not; he enjoyed being the receptive partner. And so that\u2019s\u2014he was more worried, like, \u201cHow will prostate-cancer treatment affect bottoming effectively?\u201d And Dan Dickstein was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And then that\u2019s when he sort of had the realization that I had, which is that we\u2019re not asking because we don\u2019t care about\u2014as the scientific community, as, as, you know, the medical community in the past\u2014we don\u2019t care about receptive anal intercourse. It\u2019s only: \u201cThe erect penis goes\u2014you know, what is the erect penis doing?\u201d So much focus on the erect penis rather than the receptive partner. That\u2019s sort of what got him on this search. And then Thomas Gaither, who\u2019s at [University of California, Los Angeles], was sort of having that realization as well. He\u2019s a surgeon, and he was seeing all these surgeries where the prostate would be removed. And he had heard about the male G-spot as well, you know, obviously, and he would see these patients who were getting their prostates removed, and he would wonder, like, \u201cIs that gonna affect bottoming? I mean, I don\u2019t know if this patient is interested in bottoming, but how is this affecting it?\u201d And so that sent him on this scientific journey as well. And they didn\u2019t really\u2014they didn\u2019t know about what each other was doing at the time, and so they both published papers, you know, really in the last five years and have kind of cracked open this research space. So now we\u2019re, we\u2019re really starting to see something. And, you know, Thomas Gaither has now started this, what he calls the anorectal sexual function index, which is where he is starting to ask patients about, like, what it is\u2014you know, receptive anal intercourse: how much pleasure they get, how much pain. And he\u2019s then planning on using that to then talk to patients to try to understand whether prostate-cancer treatment does affect bottoming. So we, we should have answers to this question so that when Dan Dickstein gets asked again, he\u2019ll be able to tell the patient."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s awesome. And how did people react to the survey?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So even though, as, as I mentioned, you know, we\u2019re starting to see some research in this space, no one that I had found had done a survey that was speaking to people with both vaginas and penises\u2014so with prostates and without. So even though I could sort of start seeing some stuff in the literature, I didn\u2019t have the answer to my question: \u201cDoes the male G-spot exist?\u201d And so I made this little video on social media. We obviously did the survey and, and spoke to academics to help write the survey, including Tom and Dan and, and professor Caroline Pukall, who is a sexual-health researcher in Canada. So we wrote the survey, then we put it out on social media, and it just sort of blew up in this way that I had not expected at all. We have done other sex surveys on the show, and, you know, you\u2019re looking at the\u2014one member of the team that wrote a\u2014the first [in-depth] scientific study on \u201cblue balls,\u201d [laughs] so I, I, I have done this important work before. But the response to this survey was really out of this world. So we ended up having nearly 16,000 responses that, when I was telling the academics as I was\u2014you know, I kept refreshing and refreshing and seeing these survey numbers going up and up and up, and, and the researchers were just like, \u201cOh, my gosh, like, this is amazing. Like, this is so much data. We\u2019re so excited.\u201d And so, just to put some stats around it, so\u2014and I will say, you know, most of the people who filled out the survey were in their 20s and 30s, but more than 800 responses were people over 50 ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So\u2014yeah, yeah, which was, which was really great to see, which is sort of funny \u2019cause an older person in my life came up to me and was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be your only person who ticked the over-60 box.\u201d [Laughs] I was like, \u201cNo, no, no\u2014I don\u2019t know which one\u2019s you. I don\u2019t know which one\u2019s you. It\u2019s anonymous.\u201d So\u2014and, and what we found is that this topic that, you know, is, you know, perhaps one of the last big sex taboos\u2014anal sex and anal masturbation [for the people in our survey] was so common [laughs]. So, you know, Rachel, so when we\u2019re talking about anal masturbation\u2014so this is when you\u2019re putting a finger or a toy up your own bottom\u2014nearly, nearly half the people in our survey had said that they had done it in their lifetime. Among that group, we had\u2014just over a third had done it within the past month. For anyone listening who is like, \u201cThis is a gay thing,\u201d that was absolutely not what we found in our survey. In fact, over 50 percent of straight [cisgender] men had said that, \u201cYes, I, I have had anal masturbation.\u201d So this is really common\u2014and it was over a third of cisgender women. So, so people, people are doing butt stuff. Partnered [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Alone, together\u2014yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Partnered anal penetration is similarly, similarly quite common: [about] 45 percent had said, yes, they had, they had penetrated\u2014they had had anal penetration with their partner\u2014you know, which, which, that 45 percent, by the way, it\u2019s not, not just a penis, so it could have been, like, a finger with a partner or a toy with a partner."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, and other than the general enthusiasm and response, what were some of the surprising things that you found?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"To me, and this will show my ageism, which I am sorry for, but among the older people in our survey, there was also a lot of anal play. I had kind of assumed that this was, like, a Gen Z, young millennial thing ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"But in fact, you know, nearly a third of our sample over 50 had engaged in anal masturbation within the past 30 days. You know, and that was, that was pretty similar to those in the younger age groups. So it really feels like a lot of people are exploring this. So that was really interesting to me and just how common it was. What was also incredibly delightful for me is we had a section in the survey that was sort of like, \u201cIf you want to tell us more about, you know, how you feel about anal masturbation or your orgasms, you know, please do.\u201d When I was looking at, at this response, because it\u2019s a social\u2014it\u2019s social media, was where we got most of our responses, and it\u2019s a convenient sample, you know, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not necessarily representative, I was like, \u201cIs this real? Are people being honest?\u201d But then I would read the comments that people wrote to us, and they were so genuine about wanting to inform science about their experiences with anal. You know, people would say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I filled out the survey properly, but, like, I really only orgasm if I am, you know, touching my clitoris as well as, you know, having anal penetration.\u201d Or like, you know, \u201cOh, I just really want\u2014you know, this is\u2014it\u2019s been so important to my life.\u201d Or like, \u201cAh, yeah, I\u2019ve tried it, and I don\u2019t really like it.\u201d And, like, what\u2014you know, just these, like, varying responses to the same sexual activity, I found that so fascinating because it\u2019s all just, like, when you think of the anatomy, like, it\u2019s all just, like, nerves and blood vessels, but that people were having this huge range of responses and wanting to tell us about it [laughs] and wanting to tell science about it was so delightful."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and I definitely encourage listeners who haven\u2019t to go check out the, the Science Vs episode we\u2019re, we\u2019re talking about, but to give a little bit of context for, for folks who haven\u2019t heard it yet, what did you find about the G-spot [laughs]? And all those nerves\u2014all those bundles of nerves?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"Yeah, I mean, it was\u2014so the sort of driving question going, going into this was, \u201cSo do people with prostates, are they orgasming more from, from butt play and butt stuff?\u201d And they were. They did tend to orgasm more frequently, and they also enjoyed their orgasms more. So we also asked questions like, \u201cAre your orgasms through anal, receptive anal intercourse, better than your orgasms through other kinds of sex?\u201d \u2019Cause through that question, we were really trying to, like, get to this [MythBusters] round: \u201cIs it really the best orgasm of your life?\u201d I mean, really, I was scanning through some, some news articles that have been written recently, and it\u2019s just like the, the amazingness of, apparently, these orgasms is out of control. And so, and so what we did find is that, you know, yes, in general, people with prostates were enjoying their orgasms more and were orgasming more frequently. But where things got complicated in the [data]\u2014you know, suggesting that perhaps the prostate does play a role in sexual pleasure\u2014nothing in our data suggested that it is some sex button for everyone. And in fact, you know, not everyone was orgasming from anal sex and anal play. You know, even if you just want to look at anal masturbation figures because, you know, partnered sex can be complicated and it ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"You know, involves different factors, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with your partner\u2014but if you just want to look at the masturbation figures, I think they\u2019re, they\u2019re quite useful \u2019cause then you sort of know your body, and again you would expect if you masturbated and pressed that magic sex button: bam! But we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t see, like, a \u201cbam\u201d in our data. And what we also saw that was really interesting\u2014so from Thomas Gaither\u2019s research, he had seen that people who have more experience with anal sex tend to enjoy it more. And\u2014which makes sense, and it\u2019s true for other kinds of sex as well: you know your own body; you know what you like. And so he\u2014so because I had spoken to him, I was like, \u201cOh, we need to ask about experience as well in the survey: \u2018How many times have you done this?\u2019\u201d And that ended up being really informative because once we controlled for the experience people had\u2014and so we just took people who had had quite a lot of experience with anal sex and anal masturbation\u2014then we saw the differences between people with prostates and those without them got smaller and smaller and smaller. And so from that, and then from the anatomy, to go back to your question, when you look at the, like, nerves and blood vessels around people who have prostates and those without them, it\u2019s all very, very similar. I mean, we\u2019re all cut from the same cloth [laughs]. We\u2019ve all got, like, this pudendal nerve that kind of branches into, into the butt region and stimulates all these, you know, good feelings that people can have. And that obviously explains why both people with and without prostates can enjoy anal sex. And so to go back to this question of, like, \u201cDoes the male G-spot exist?\u201d what we ultimately concluded is that\u2014I mean, I think I\u2019m probably giving the game away\u2014there\u2019s, there\u2019s no magic sex button, per se. There\u2019s, there\u2019s many sort of different points along the butt that can be arousing. And, and perhaps for some people, the prostate is quite special and is a, is a nice thing, and we definitely saw that in the data for some people. But it\u2019s definitely\u2014yeah, but it\u2019s not a magic sex button. So that was, that was the\u2014so I think, I think \u201cmyth busted\u201d is, is really where we, where we landed."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what are researchers hoping to do with the data you collected?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So we\u2019re really excited \u2019cause now we\u2019re working with this group of academics, including Dan Dickstein, to write it up into a scientific paper and to, to put the data out there. And it\u2019s, yeah, it\u2019s really wonderful. We had a meeting with them recently\u2014with Dan and, and Caroline Pukall and Sam Levang, who helped us analyze the data to begin with\u2014and, and everyone\u2019s just really excited to get this information out there, to, to break these taboos around anal sex. I mean, once you see the figures of, of how common it is, at least in our sample, and how people are enjoying it, for the most part, it\u2019s just hard to feel this, like, \u201cUh-oh, we shouldn\u2019t be talking about this,\u201d when almost 50 percent of our sample had tried it. I should be honest with you: when starting to research this, I was quite nervous about putting it on my work calendar: \u201cmale G-spot,\u201d \u201canal sex\u201d; quite nervous about, you know, we had a couple of clips that we put on Instagram\u2014I was like, \u201cOh, no, am I gonna be, like, the anal-sex lady?\u201d And now it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d [Laughs] \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s just\u2014I, I think, I think, without good scientific data and surveys like this one, I mean, where are people gonna get their information about anal sex? It\u2019s gonna be pornography or their friends. And getting your information about anal sex from pornography is probably the worst place to get it because, as we talk about in the episode, preparation\u2014if you are going for\u2014you know, if you are planning on putting something fairly large into your butthole, such as a penis, it, it can be quite painful if you\u2019re not going about it the right way and if you\u2019re not relaxed and you\u2019re not using a lot of lubrication and you\u2019re not going slow, for example.\u00a0 And in pornography, what you see is really just a dick jamming into a butthole. And, and I know there is literature out there on, you know, often women\u2019s experiences of anal sex where that is what their partner has done. And it is just the worst place. So, so breaking taboos around receptive anal intercourse isn\u2019t just fun ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"It\u2019s also really important that we just start talking to people about how to do this properly so that we can have a good time with it rather than it being a painful experience."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, in talking about, you know, the importance of preparation and, and getting good information, what kind of responses did you get about negative experiences?"},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"So we also asked about coercion, which is: \u201cHad people ever felt pressure to have receptive anal intercourse when they weren\u2019t comfortable with it?\u201d And this was also fairly common, so more than one in five in our sample said yes. And it was particularly common amongst certain groups, so more than 40 percent of gay cis men said yes, more than a third of people who were assigned female at birth said yes. And so that is also something that\u2019s worth discussing: you know, why this is happening, why people are feeling this coercion. And then away from that, we also heard from people who just weren\u2019t that into it ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"And I think that\u2019s really important to say because there\u2019s preferences around all kinds of sexual activities. And, you know, there\u2014when we asked people for, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d and some people said, you know, \u201cOh, it\u2019s mind-blowing sex. It\u2019s blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\u201d we also had people who just wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Zukerman","text":"\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d [Laughs] You know, like, \u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s [fine].\u201d You know, a lot of people, when we asked, \u201cIs this, you know, better than other kinds of orgasms you\u2019ve had, or is it the same as other kinds of orgasm?\u201d you know, a lot of people were just like, \u201cIt\u2019s just the same. It\u2019s fine.\u201d [Laughs] Like, it\u2014so I think that\u2019s really important to say: while some people really enjoy it, others don\u2019t. So I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s just a question of, like, \u201cIs this something you want to explore? And here\u2019s some really good information about it.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. And what kind of response have you gotten to the episode?

So people do not like to tell us that they\u2019re listening. I, I have to say, the male G-spot episode has probably been a little bit louder than, than our other episodes.

People are listening [laughs]. They\u2019re just not telling us about it.\u201d There was someone on TikTok that I thought was very sweet, and he was [laughs], he was just, like, \u201cOnly an Australian could talk this openly about anal sex.\u201d But you know what, Rachel, we could change that, you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Absolutely, I think that\u2019s a fantastic goal.

And this idea came up about the male G-spot, which has been around for ages, and if you go online, like, basically every website out there, from, you know, British GQ, to, like, Healthline\u2014you know, all these, like, seemingly medical-based websites\u2014you know, everyone\u2019s like, \u201cThe male G-spot, you know, this is\u2014if you press it, you\u2019ll get the most amazing orgasms of your life.\u201d And for the uninitiated, the male G-spot is the prostate.

And what kinds of sex is science allowed to study and are doctors allowed to talk about? And, and, like, anal sex had\u2014has sort of been, like, shifted off to the side as something taboo.

So I, I really\u2014where\u2014it was really interesting because two researchers from across the country in the U.S., one in New York and one in L.A., had actually started looking at this question of receptive anal intercourse just, you know, within the last several years. And they both came upon it from the same perspective.\u00a0 So both of them had been working with prostate cancer patients. And with prostate cancer, the treatment can often affect erections. And so they would be talking to their patients and asking a lot about erections. And both of them, in fact, told me this quote\u2014they were like, \u201cSo we were asking, \u2018Erections, erections, erections.\u2019\u201d So that, if you have them both side by side, that is six erections. And, and then for Dr. Dan Dickstein, who\u2019s at Mount Sinai Hospital, one of his patients asked him, \u201cWell, what about receptive anal intercourse?\u201d For him, for this patient, it wasn\u2019t that important whether he had an erection or not; he enjoyed being the receptive partner. And so that\u2019s\u2014he was more worried, like, \u201cHow will prostate-cancer treatment affect bottoming effectively?\u201d And Dan Dickstein was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And then that\u2019s when he sort of had the realization that I had, which is that we\u2019re not asking because we don\u2019t care about\u2014as the scientific community, as, as, you know, the medical community in the past\u2014we don\u2019t care about receptive anal intercourse. It\u2019s only: \u201cThe erect penis goes\u2014you know, what is the erect penis doing?\u201d So much focus on the erect penis rather than the receptive partner. That\u2019s sort of what got him on this search. And then Thomas Gaither, who\u2019s at [University of California, Los Angeles], was sort of having that realization as well. He\u2019s a surgeon, and he was seeing all these surgeries where the prostate would be removed. And he had heard about the male G-spot as well, you know, obviously, and he would see these patients who were getting their prostates removed, and he would wonder, like, \u201cIs that gonna affect bottoming? I mean, I don\u2019t know if this patient is interested in bottoming, but how is this affecting it?\u201d And so that sent him on this scientific journey as well. And they didn\u2019t really\u2014they didn\u2019t know about what each other was doing at the time, and so they both published papers, you know, really in the last five years and have kind of cracked open this research space. So now we\u2019re, we\u2019re really starting to see something. And, you know, Thomas Gaither has now started this, what he calls the anorectal sexual function index, which is where he is starting to ask patients about, like, what it is\u2014you know, receptive anal intercourse: how much pleasure they get, how much pain. And he\u2019s then planning on using that to then talk to patients to try to understand whether prostate-cancer treatment does affect bottoming. So we, we should have answers to this question so that when Dan Dickstein gets asked again, he\u2019ll be able to tell the patient."]},{"begin":"478.800","end":"482.320","lines":["That\u2019s awesome.

So even though I could sort of start seeing some stuff in the literature, I didn\u2019t have the answer to my question: \u201cDoes the male G-spot exist?\u201d And so I made this little video on social media. We obviously did the survey and, and spoke to academics to help write the survey, including Tom and Dan and, and professor Caroline Pukall, who is a sexual-health researcher in Canada. So we wrote the survey, then we put it out on social media, and it just sort of blew up in this way that I had not expected at all. We have done other sex surveys on the show, and, you know, you\u2019re looking at the\u2014one member of the team that wrote a\u2014the first [in-depth] scientific study on \u201cblue balls,\u201d [laughs] so I, I, I have done this important work before. But the response to this survey was really out of this world. So we ended up having nearly 16,000 responses that, when I was telling the academics as I was\u2014you know, I kept refreshing and refreshing and seeing these survey numbers going up and up and up, and, and the researchers were just like, \u201cOh, my gosh, like, this is amazing. Like, this is so much data. We\u2019re so excited.\u201d And so, just to put some stats around it, so\u2014and I will say, you know, most of the people who filled out the survey were in their 20s and 30s, but more than 800 responses were people over 50 ..."]},{"begin":"565.560","end":"565.840","lines":["Oh, wow."]},{"begin":"565.840","end":"624.240","lines":["So\u2014yeah, yeah, which was, which was really great to see, which is sort of funny \u2019cause an older person in my life came up to me and was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be your only person who ticked the over-60 box.\u201d [Laughs] I was like, \u201cNo, no, no\u2014I don\u2019t know which one\u2019s you.

You know, and that was, that was pretty similar to those in the younger age groups. So it really feels like a lot of people are exploring this. So that was really interesting to me and just how common it was. What was also incredibly delightful for me is we had a section in the survey that was sort of like, \u201cIf you want to tell us more about, you know, how you feel about anal masturbation or your orgasms, you know, please do.\u201d When I was looking at, at this response, because it\u2019s a social\u2014it\u2019s social media, was where we got most of our responses, and it\u2019s a convenient sample, you know, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not necessarily representative, I was like, \u201cIs this real? Are people being honest?\u201d But then I would read the comments that people wrote to us, and they were so genuine about wanting to inform science about their experiences with anal. You know, people would say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I filled out the survey properly, but, like, I really only orgasm if I am, you know, touching my clitoris as well as, you know, having anal penetration.\u201d Or like, you know, \u201cOh, I just really want\u2014you know, this is\u2014it\u2019s been so important to my life.\u201d Or like, \u201cAh, yeah, I\u2019ve tried it, and I don\u2019t really like it.\u201d And, like, what\u2014you know, just these, like, varying responses to the same sexual activity, I found that so fascinating because it\u2019s all just, like, when you think of the anatomy, like, it\u2019s all just, like, nerves and blood vessels, but that people were having this huge range of responses and wanting to tell us about it [laughs] and wanting to tell science about it was so delightful."]},{"begin":"744.200","end":"763.200","lines":["Yeah, well, and I definitely encourage listeners who haven\u2019t to go check out the, the Science Vs episode we\u2019re, we\u2019re talking about, but to give a little bit of context for, for folks who haven\u2019t heard it yet, what did you find about the G-spot [laughs]? And all those nerves\u2014all those bundles of nerves?"]},{"begin":"763.200","end":"829.280","lines":["Yeah, I mean, it was\u2014so the sort of driving question going, going into this was, \u201cSo do people with prostates, are they orgasming more from, from butt play and butt stuff?\u201d And they were. They did tend to orgasm more frequently, and they also enjoyed their orgasms more. So we also asked questions like, \u201cAre your orgasms through anal, receptive anal intercourse, better than your orgasms through other kinds of sex?\u201d \u2019Cause through that question, we were really trying to, like, get to this [MythBusters] round: \u201cIs it really the best orgasm of your life?\u201d I mean, really, I was scanning through some, some news articles that have been written recently, and it\u2019s just like the, the amazingness of, apparently, these orgasms is out of control. And so, and so what we did find is that, you know, yes, in general, people with prostates were enjoying their orgasms more and were orgasming more frequently. But where things got complicated in the [data]\u2014you know, suggesting that perhaps the prostate does play a role in sexual pleasure\u2014nothing in our data suggested that it is some sex button for everyone. And in fact, you know, not everyone was orgasming from anal sex and anal play. You know, even if you just want to look at anal masturbation figures because, you know, partnered sex can be complicated and it ..."]},{"begin":"829.280","end":"830.160","lines":["Sure, yeah."]},{"begin":"830.160","end":"944.600","lines":["You know, involves different factors, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with your partner\u2014but if you just want to look at the masturbation figures, I think they\u2019re, they\u2019re quite useful \u2019cause then you sort of know your body, and again you would expect if you masturbated and pressed that magic sex button: bam! But we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t see, like, a \u201cbam\u201d in our data. And what we also saw that was really interesting\u2014so from Thomas Gaither\u2019s research, he had seen that people who have more experience with anal sex tend to enjoy it more. And\u2014which makes sense, and it\u2019s true for other kinds of sex as well: you know your own body; you know what you like. And so he\u2014so because I had spoken to him, I was like, \u201cOh, we need to ask about experience as well in the survey: \u2018How many times have you done this?\u2019\u201d And that ended up being really informative because once we controlled for the experience people had\u2014and so we just took people who had had quite a lot of experience with anal sex and anal masturbation\u2014then we saw the differences between people with prostates and those without them got smaller and smaller and smaller. And so from that, and then from the anatomy, to go back to your question, when you look at the, like, nerves and blood vessels around people who have prostates and those without them, it\u2019s all very, very similar. I mean, we\u2019re all cut from the same cloth [laughs]. We\u2019ve all got, like, this pudendal nerve that kind of branches into, into the butt region and stimulates all these, you know, good feelings that people can have. And that obviously explains why both people with and without prostates can enjoy anal sex. And so to go back to this question of, like, \u201cDoes the male G-spot exist?\u201d what we ultimately concluded is that\u2014I mean, I think I\u2019m probably giving the game away\u2014there\u2019s, there\u2019s no magic sex button, per se. There\u2019s, there\u2019s many sort of different points along the butt that can be arousing. And, and perhaps for some people, the prostate is quite special and is a, is a nice thing, and we definitely saw that in the data for some people. But it\u2019s definitely\u2014yeah, but it\u2019s not a magic sex button. So that was, that was the\u2014so I think, I think \u201cmyth busted\u201d is, is really where we, where we landed."]},{"begin":"944.600","end":"948.600","lines":["So what are researchers hoping to do with the data you collected?"]},{"begin":"948.600","end":"1001.840","lines":["So we\u2019re really excited \u2019cause now we\u2019re working with this group of academics, including Dan Dickstein, to write it up into a scientific paper and to, to put the data out there.

I should be honest with you: when starting to research this, I was quite nervous about putting it on my work calendar: \u201cmale G-spot,\u201d \u201canal sex\u201d; quite nervous about, you know, we had a couple of clips that we put on Instagram\u2014I was like, \u201cOh, no, am I gonna be, like, the anal-sex lady?\u201d And now it\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d [Laughs] \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d"]},{"begin":"1001.840","end":"1002.280","lines":["Yeah [laughs]."]},{"begin":"1002.280","end":"1056.160","lines":["It\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s just\u2014I, I think, I think, without good scientific data and surveys like this one, I mean, where are people gonna get their information about anal sex?

And getting your information about anal sex from pornography is probably the worst place to get it because, as we talk about in the episode, preparation\u2014if you are going for\u2014you know, if you are planning on putting something fairly large into your butthole, such as a penis, it, it can be quite painful if you\u2019re not going about it the right way and if you\u2019re not relaxed and you\u2019re not using a lot of lubrication and you\u2019re not going slow, for example.\u00a0 And in pornography, what you see is really just a dick jamming into a butthole. And, and I know there is literature out there on, you know, often women\u2019s experiences of anal sex where that is what their partner has done. And it is just the worst place.
