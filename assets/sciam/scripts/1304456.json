[CLIP: Opening music] I\u2019m Shayla Love, and you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly. We\u2019ve been talking about love this week, and so far we\u2019ve maintained a pretty basic assumption: that love is good, that love makes us happier. But does it? And if so, does it bring the same amount of happiness to everyone?\u00a0 [CLIP: Ending music]"},{"author":"Love: ","text":"Here\u2019s where I fess up that this topic has been on my mind a lot lately. Last year, I left a 10-year relationship, one I might once have said would last forever. I am currently single, really, for the first time as an adult. And it\u2019s made me ask the question: Is life better now, or was it better before?"},{"author":"K","text":"I knew you and your partner since you started dating. And I have seen how happy that relationship made you. It's not like you moved on without any pain. But I think you were just really ready to take a step and recalibrate your life for what you wanted and what you needed. And I don't think that I've seen you as happy and successful as you are today and we\u2019ve know each other since we were 15.\u00a0"},{"author":"Love","text":"But here\u2019s the thing.

Quality matters more."},{"author":"Reis","text":"So whether it\u2019s a satisfying, rewarding, intimate connection makes more of a difference for women's happiness than it does for men's happiness."},{"author":"Love: ","text":"But the underlying factor in all of this might not have anything to do with romantic connections at all. It could be the other relationships women have in their lives."},{"author":"Slatcher","text":"Women tend to have a closer network of friends who they can open up to, who they feel emotionally close to, compared to men.

That\u2019s because of something called the paradox of hedonism. This is the observation that when you try to achieve happiness or pleasure directly, the result is unhappiness."},{"author":"Jenkins: ","text":"You're better off focusing on something else that can lead to satisfaction in your life and can lead to having a sense of meaning or purpose in your life.

It\u2019s also easy to be wary of older data that show married women were better off. Women\u2019s lives have improved significantly in terms of how much independence they can have and the lives they\u2019re able to lead. This made sense to our Hinge Debrief group chat, where our most recent breakups featured imbalances that we just didn\u2019t want to put up with anymore."},{"author":"K: ","text":"In that relationship, I did the classic female thing of making myself very small and making my needs very small, right, not being demanding, not asking for what I needed."},{"author":"Sarah: ","text":"Women, like, take care of things in ways that men don\u2019t do for themselves."},{"author":"Love: ","text":"So based on the information that\u2019s out there, relationships\u2014but those of all kinds\u2014are important to living a good life.

We lived on the first floor facing a garden, and we stood in the kitchen together, and he turned out the lights. When the lights turned off, a chorus of cricket chirping erupted. He flipped the light switch on, and the crickets immediately stopped.\u00a0 Lights off: crickets.\u00a0 Lights on: no crickets.\u00a0 Switching the lights on and off, we could make our own tune out of cricket chirping. My partner had not only noticed this quirk but knew that I would love it and couldn\u2019t wait to share it with me.\u00a0 That\u2019s the magic of a relationship I\u2019d like to capture again, even if it won\u2019t necessarily lead to happily ever after.
