Scientists are finding that specialized cells in our intestines can send signals directly to the brain, potentially influencing appetite and even mood."},{"author":"","text":"Recent studies hint that our microbiomes could play a role in this communication system, though researchers are still trying to understand exactly how these interactions work and what they mean for our health."},{"author":"","text":"Here to walk us through the emerging science of the belly-to-brain connection is Maya Kaelberer, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Physiology."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Maya Kaelberer","text":"It\u2019s my pleasure. I\u2019m happy to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you recently co-authored a study that looks at the gut-brain connection a little bit. Could you tell us a little bit about why scientists are interested in that and what we know about it so far?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"Yeah, I mean, I think more than just scientists are interested in it; we have our gut feelings all the time. And so my work is really focused on understanding the biology behind those gut feelings and how is it that our gut can communicate to us. \u2019Cause we know, right, things like hangry exist. We know that how we feel or what food we eat or even what microbes are there is gonna affect overall how we feel in the world."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"And so understanding the molecular and cellular and neuronal connections between the gut and the brain is gonna help us better understand, like, this relationship that we have, that we have these gut feelings, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"We know they\u2019re there [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, and beyond, you know, hanger, which is obviously a great example, what are some conditions that have been connected to the gut that might surprise people?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"So when I was in my postdoc we discovered that there was this direct connection between these cells in the surface of the gut, we call them neuropod cells, and neurons that communicate directly\u2014they reach directly into the brain. And so we call this as\u2014our \u201cgut sense,\u201d and the number-one question I would always get was: Who cares? Like, what [laughs], you know, what is our gut possibly telling us that our mouth and our nose did not already tell us about the food that we ate?"},{"author":"","text":"And so we delved into this a little bit more in some previous publications with regards to sugar sensing, and I use this example \u2019cause it\u2019s really salient in my own life, which is that I like artificial sweetener in my coffee."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"And I don\u2019t like regular sugar because regular sugar just feels heavy to me, and I want that, like, artificial sweetener. It kind of keeps me going. I can be caffeinated. I can be, like, on the go. I\u2019m not gonna, like, sit down and take a nap afterwards. And so we know that these two stimuli feel different in our gut. And what we found is that these neuropod cells are actually distinguishing between the two stimuli, between real sugar and artificial sweetener. And they release different signals, and then the signal for sugar actually drives the animal to consume the sugar over the artificial sweetener."},{"author":"","text":"So now we take it back to my coffee preference, and suddenly, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, this makes sense. I like the artificial sweetener because I don\u2019t want that heaviness.\u201d And that heaviness is telling me that that food was gratifying or that food was satisfying; there was some kind of value associated with that that\u2019s gonna help me survive in nature. And so then this is now this communication system of, like, \u201cOh, our gut sense is telling us something about the food we eat past whether or not it tastes good. It\u2019s telling us a little bit about the value of what we\u2019re consuming.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So let\u2019s get into the latest study. What were you guys looking for, and what did you find?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"Yeah, so the microbiome is everywhere. We\u2019re always hearing about how the microbiome affects a lot of our behaviors, and there\u2019s all this really cool work that\u2019s coming out showing that there are these different species, they can affect your mood, but we don\u2019t really know what that connection is. And so when we found that these neuropod cells are responding to nutrients, we thought, \u201cOh, well, in the gut there\u2019s this microbiome population. I wonder if the microbiome is actually signaling via these neuropod cells.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so it turns out what we found is they do, hence the study. And they\u2019re doing it in this really interesting way. So what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re sensing this protein that\u2019s on the tail of the bacteria, and this is any bacteria that has a tail\u2014it has to swim around, has a tail\u2014and this protein, so it\u2019s pretty widely expressed across all these different microbes. And what [a neuropod cell is] sensing is: it\u2019s sensing that protein, and that protein tells the animal when it\u2019s being sensed that the animal should eat a little bit less and when the protein isn\u2019t there that the animal should eat a little bit more."},{"author":"","text":"And you can think, like, this might be counterintuitive because aren\u2019t we against bacteria [laughs], right? Like, it, it infects us all the time. We don\u2019t want it to grow. But that\u2019s not always true. We want our microbiome to grow. We want it to be healthy. We want it to maintain a good population size because it has all these benefits. And so what we found is that this is actually a circuit, via these neuropod cells, and it\u2019s a direct connection that allows the microbiome and the host to somehow communicate about what its food needs are."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. So what do you think the implications of those findings are?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"So I think that the implications of these findings open a lot of possibilities, right? If we know\u2014it\u2019s, like, figuring out: What\u2019s the language they\u2019re using to communicate? And now, once we know what the language they\u2019re using is, now you can imagine: \u201cOkay, are there nutrients that affect the signaling pathway? Are there probiotics that influence it more or less? Are there other signals, for instance, from the microbes, not just this tail protein but other things that are actually influencing different types of behavior?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"Like, there are some studies that are looking at social interaction and showing that there\u2019s a certain species of microbes that\u2019s associated with being more sociable, but we still don\u2019t know what that direct pathway is. And so this is just kind of the beginning of, like, well, what is this, this \u201cneurobiotic sense\u201d is what we\u2019re calling it, because it\u2019s this whole new sense that\u2019s all about: How do we communicate with our microbiome, and how does our microbiome communicate with us?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what are your next steps research-wise?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"So research-wise the next steps are\u2014I actually already mentioned them a little bit. We\u2019re interested to know how it is that the food that we\u2019re eating is being processed by those microbes in order to adjust that signal. So you could imagine, like, a high-fat or a high-sugar diet\u2014I have this pet theory: I think that people with a sweet tooth actually have microbes with a sweet tooth and that there\u2019s some kind of communication going on there that\u2019s saying, like, \u201cHey, maybe eat a little more sugar. We want a little more sugar down here.\u201d Or, like, a high-fat diet, this is another, like, thing that we study a lot is: How is it that our diet, or highly processed food, how is this actually influencing that ecosystem that we contain in our gut?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"How far out do you think we are from being able to take advantage of some of these gut-brain connections by manipulating our microbiome?"},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"Rachel, that is a great question because we talk a lot about the science, we talk about the initial discoveries. I\u2019m gonna give a small example, which is Ozempic. You\u2019ve probably heard of Ozempic."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"It\u2019s a GLP-1 agonist. GLP-1 is what\u2019s called a satiety hormone. This satiety hormone was discovered in animals. And so you think about it: Okay, we discovered it in animals. We tested it, we tested its function and basic research. We moved on into human research. And then the first Ozempic drugs, if I\u2019m getting my dates right, were in the teens, was when they came out. And so now we\u2019re talking about, like, 30 years of research that had to go into this really key discovery that was made before we had the implications in human health."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna take that long because there\u2019s a lot of other stuff that we\u2019ve built on."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"But I think it\u2019s important to know, like, all right, you\u2019ve gotta test the mechanism. We don\u2019t just give people anything [laughs], right? We have to go through the process of, like, testing it out, testing what we know about it and then testing, like, are there other drugs, say\u2014so this is another common way to do it\u2014are there other drugs that are already approved in humans that are influencing this new pathway that we discovered and are having this positive effect? And so that pathway is actually a quicker way to get to human implications."},{"author":"","text":"And so one thing that I thought was really cool about the study that we did was that it\u2019s an experiment that\u2019s, at, at kind of the end, was testing this in what are called germ-free mice. So germ-free mice are mice that have never seen a microbe in their lives. They grow up without bacteria at all. They\u2019re completely free of it. And these mice are a little weird; turns out we need them. But what we did is we took these germ-free mice and we tested whether that tail protein, this flagellin signal, had the same effect in these mice. And it did; it actually\u2014it decreased their feeding."},{"author":"","text":"And why do I point that out? It seems like, \u201cSo what? Who cares?\u201d Right? But this finding, I think, is actually really interesting because what it implies is that the mouse did not need prior experience in order for this circuit to actually exist. And when that happens, usually what that means is this is because the circuit evolved; we evolved with our microbiomes in order to communicate. This isn\u2019t just some kind of reaction that we\u2019re learning based on what microbes come into our body."},{"author":"","text":"And so I think understanding that kind of aspect of it puts a different spin on the research \u2019cause now we\u2019re talking about, okay, this is a lifelong interaction that we\u2019ve had, so now we know we can\u2019t just get rid of it, right? You can\u2019t just take the microbes out. We actually have to work with the microbes in order to improve health."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"As you can probably tell I\u2019m very passionate about the work that I\u2019m doing, and I just think that we\u2019re at the forefront of so many really cool discoveries. So I, I always ask, Rachel, and I\u2019m gonna ask you this question: Now that you know what a gut sense is, think about your last meal. How did you feel? How did your gut feel about what you last ate?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I think my gut felt pretty good about what I last ate. It was a salad. There was a lot, a lot of variety in there. There was a lot going on. So I don\u2019t think my gut felt bad about it [laughs]."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"But now you\u2019re gonna be thinking about it. Now sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d like, if I eat a plate of vegetables, I\u2019m like, \u201cMm.\u201d I can feel\u2014like, it\u2019s not as rewarding as cake, right? Like ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"[Laughs] Let\u2019s all be honest about that. But I\u2019m like, \u201cMm.\u201d I feel the satisfaction that my gut is like, \u201cYou made a good decision.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] I love that. Thanks so much for coming on."},{"author":"Kaelberer","text":"Of course. Thank you so much."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode. We\u2019ll be back on Friday to talk about how social media algorithms are shaping the future of language."},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi and Jeff DelViscio.

And so we know that these two stimuli feel different in our gut.

And so then this is now this communication system of, like, \u201cOh, our gut sense is telling us something about the food we eat past whether or not it tastes good.

And so when we found that these neuropod cells are responding to nutrients, we thought, \u201cOh, well, in the gut there\u2019s this microbiome population.

And what [a neuropod cell is] sensing is: it\u2019s sensing that protein, and that protein tells the animal when it\u2019s being sensed that the animal should eat a little bit less and when the protein isn\u2019t there that the animal should eat a little bit more."]},{"begin":"342.960","end":"372.520","lines":["And you can think, like, this might be counterintuitive because aren\u2019t we against bacteria [laughs], right?

We want it to maintain a good population size because it has all these benefits.

We want a little more sugar down here.\u201d Or, like, a high-fat diet, this is another, like, thing that we study a lot is: How is it that our diet, or highly processed food, how is this actually influencing that ecosystem that we contain in our gut?"]},{"begin":"477.280","end":"486.840","lines":["How far out do you think we are from being able to take advantage of some of these gut-brain connections by manipulating our microbiome?"]},{"begin":"486.840","end":"501.920","lines":["Rachel, that is a great question because we talk a lot about the science, we talk about the initial discoveries.

And so now we\u2019re talking about, like, 30 years of research that had to go into this really key discovery that was made before we had the implications in human health."]},{"begin":"542.200","end":"542.880","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"542.880","end":"546.960","lines":["I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna take that long because there\u2019s a lot of other stuff that we\u2019ve built on."]},{"begin":"546.960","end":"547.680","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"547.680","end":"576.320","lines":["But I think it\u2019s important to know, like, all right, you\u2019ve gotta test the mechanism. We don\u2019t just give people anything [laughs], right? We have to go through the process of, like, testing it out, testing what we know about it and then testing, like, are there other drugs, say\u2014so this is another common way to do it\u2014are there other drugs that are already approved in humans that are influencing this new pathway that we discovered and are having this positive effect? And so that pathway is actually a quicker way to get to human implications."]},{"begin":"576.320","end":"612.040","lines":["And so one thing that I thought was really cool about the study that we did was that it\u2019s an experiment that\u2019s, at, at kind of the end, was testing this in what are called germ-free mice. So germ-free mice are mice that have never seen a microbe in their lives. They grow up without bacteria at all. They\u2019re completely free of it. And these mice are a little weird; turns out we need them. But what we did is we took these germ-free mice and we tested whether that tail protein, this flagellin signal, had the same effect in these mice. And it did; it actually\u2014it decreased their feeding."]},{"begin":"612.040","end":"640.320","lines":["And why do I point that out? It seems like, \u201cSo what? Who cares?\u201d Right? But this finding, I think, is actually really interesting because what it implies is that the mouse did not need prior experience in order for this circuit to actually exist. And when that happens, usually what that means is this is because the circuit evolved; we evolved with our microbiomes in order to communicate. This isn\u2019t just some kind of reaction that we\u2019re learning based on what microbes come into our body."]},{"begin":"640.320","end":"660.000","lines":["And so I think understanding that kind of aspect of it puts a different spin on the research \u2019cause now we\u2019re talking about, okay, this is a lifelong interaction that we\u2019ve had, so now we know we can\u2019t just get rid of it, right? You can\u2019t just take the microbes out.
