Scientists and scholars have surmised as much from archaeological remains in Newfoundland\u00a0and by scrutinizing ancient texts\u00a0like the Icelandic sagas."

      "text": "But now Dee and his colleagues have been able to come up with a precise date\u2014the year 1021\u2014based on evidence these Norse visitors left behind: specifically, a stump, a log\u00a0and a branch. Wood anatomists have determined that certain surfaces of that wood must have been cut by metal blades\u2014a Viking technology the local Indigenous people are not known to have shared. And Dee\u2019s team was able to use a cosmic occurrence\u2014an extraordinary shower of high-energy particles from space\u00a0around the year 993\u2014to date the felling of the trees. You see, that shower of cosmic rays created an abundance of radiocarbon. When taken up by trees, it left a lasting signature in tree rings\u2014giving the scientists a key to pinpoint the year 993 in the three wood samples\u00a0using radiocarbon dating."

      "text": "And then you see what we have to do is count the rings from there to the edge. You have to know where the edge is, the bark edge. And then you\u2019ll know that was the last growth year of the tree,\u00a0or the felling date of the tree. And it just so happened in all three cases it was exactly the same year: 1021 A.D."

[Margot Kuitems et al., Evidence for European presence in the Americas in AD 1021] The year 1021 therefore marks the first time we know of that Europeans set foot in the Americas. But\u00a0as the authors write, it also marks \u201cthe earliest known year by which human migration had encircled the planet.\u201d"
