      "text": "This is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. I\u2019m Fionna Samuels. The life of a polar bear is hard. It\u2019s made even harder as temperatures climb. The bears of the north largely depend on sea ice to survive, hunting seals that take a breath through gaps in the ice. For most bears, their feeding opportunities disappear as sheets of sea ice melt. Now researchers have identified a new subpopulation of polar bears that may be able to survive longer thanks to their ability to use glacial ice as a sea ice alternative."

      "text": "We lay out the evidence for a previously undocumented and highly isolated subpopulation of polar bears living on the southeast coast of Greenland. We knew you could find polar bears in that area, but we just didn\u2019t think there were that many, because it\u2019s not really a place, you'd expect a lot of bears or bears to be able to persist for very long."

    {
      "author": "Samuels",
      "text": "Basically\u2014the area wasn\u2019t expected to be particularly bear-friendly because it goes long periods of time without sea ice. Generally, polar bears will starve if there are more than 100 sea-ice-free days during the year because they primarily rely on sea ice to hunt for seals and other prey. But these bears can supplement the sea-ice-free days with glacial ice."

    {
      "author": "Laidre",
      "text": "We realized that this glacial ice was essentially supporting an isolated population. So it wasn\u2019t just they were using it, you know, opportunistically; it was that the only way these bears would live in this isolated place and be isolated for hundreds of years with such a short sea ice season is to take advantage of this glacial ice and really rely on it for survival."

And then, you know, it has to also be presented in the context of the whole Arctic, and what we see we\u2019re headed for, and you know, the fact that all polar bears don\u2019t have this option\u2014and most don\u2019t."

      "text": "As climate change brings us closer to an ice-free arctic, this group of polar bears may help scientists understand how the species may persist. Those that persist might look a lot like this subpopulation, living in similar environmental pockets."
