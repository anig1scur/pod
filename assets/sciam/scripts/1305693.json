      "author": "Prestini",

      "text": ": Yeah. Turning astronomical data into sound is not just cool, these soundscapes can also inspire folks who are blind and visually impaired, in the same way that you or I, Jason, you know, are inspired by those images from Hubble and the JWST. And also, these sounds might lead to some discoveries, too. To get there, the field is going to need to be more formalized. Should a bright star lead to a low pitch or a high pitch? Is a cello or an oboe a better instrument to capture a comet\u2019s path? Right now there\u2019s no standardization."

You can sonify the stock market by making a piano\u2019s note correspond to the nightly closing stock number. [CLIP: Music] Or if you want to be silly, you could sonify the annual number of Prussian cavalry members killed by horse kicks, starting in 1875. [CLIP: Music]"

The notes, dynamics and instrumentation of the Hubble Cantata don\u2019t map exactly to the stars or galaxies that people saw in the VR simulation. [CLIP: Hubble Cantata] Paola was more inspired by the images. But other scientists are doing that one-to-one mapping. [CLIP: \u201cTRAPPIST sounds\u201d by Matt Russo]"
