We\u2019re going to take you on a journey through the stars."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Welcome to part one of a three-part Fascination on how scientists and artists are turning space into sound. You\u2019ve seen photographs from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope. Now, get ready to hear them, including one brand-new sonification that has never been publicly released."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"But to get to the stars, we need to start somewhere a little bit closer to home."},{"author":"Paola Prestini","text":"What we did in the park was essentially create, like, an eight-point loudspeaker system so that people in the park could feel like they were traveling through space in this kind of completely enveloped sound. To essentially take you, as a viewer, were suspended in space, with Earth at your toes, going through this incredible journey, finally, through the Orion Nebula."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"This is Paola Prestini, she\u2019s an award-winning composer who has collaborated with poets, and artists, and scientists. She also likes to say she \u201cpaints with data.\u201d"},{"author":"Prestini","text":"My training is obviously in composition. I like to say that I\u2019m essentially an explorer, and I do that mainly through sound."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"Prestini isn\u2019t the only one turning astronomical data into sound. Other artists and scientists are using markers such as orbital paths and star brightness to craft their own symphonies. It\u2019s led to the birth of a new field: astronomical sonification."},{"author":"Prestini","text":"There\u2019s this idea that there\u2019s no sound in space because we can\u2019t hear them. In fact, there\u2019s been incredible explorations, most recently with black holes and pitching the [gravitational] waves up so that we can actually hear them with human ears."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Astronomy has always been a visual science, but data doesn\u2019t care how it\u2019s presented. Scientists have just been defaulting to images. And that\u2019s changing now."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"Yeah. Turning astronomical data into sound is not just cool, these soundscapes can also inspire folks who are blind and visually impaired, in the same way that you or I, Jason, you know, are inspired by those images from Hubble and the JWST. And also, these sounds might lead to some discoveries, too. To get there, the field is going to need to be more formalized. Should a bright star lead to a low pitch or a high pitch? Is a cello or an oboe a better instrument to capture a comet\u2019s path? Right now there\u2019s no standardization."},{"author":"Prestini","text":"In terms of sonification, and as composers, we kind of make up these rules."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Timmy, what the hell even is a sonification?"},{"author":"Broderick","text":"Right, so a sonification is exactly what it \u201csounds\u201d like. It\u2019s turning data into sound. You can sonify the stock market by making a piano\u2019s note correspond to the nightly closing stock number. [CLIP: Music] Or if you want to be silly, you could sonify the annual number of Prussian cavalry members killed by horse kicks, starting in 1875. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Broderick","text":"In both of these clips, you can hear the data pretty clearly. What Paola is doing is a little different. The notes, dynamics and instrumentation of the Hubble Cantata don\u2019t map exactly to the stars or galaxies that people saw in the VR simulation. [CLIP: Hubble Cantata] Paola was more inspired by the images. But other scientists are doing that one-to-one mapping.

And each time a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a little bit of light."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"The notes you\u2019re hearing are planets completing their orbit. This is an \u201corbital frequency.\u201d Matt multiplied each planet\u2019s frequency and turned these stellar passages into specific musical notes. He then stacked the frequencies, added drums for when neighboring planets passed one another, and voil\u00e0."},{"author":"Russo","text":"When I saw the pattern in their orbits, I could quickly calculate which notes those correspond to, and I knew would be a really, like pleasing, beautiful chord altogether."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Matt is a physics professor at the University of Toronto, as well as a musician and a data sonification specialist. When he was growing up, he loved both music and astronomy but he couldn\u2019t find a way to marry the two passions."},{"author":"Russo","text":"As I grew older, it became actually a source of conflict because everyone told me I had to pick one or the other. I kept these two worlds in parallel, knowing they would eventually crash at some point and explode, or I don\u2019t know what was going to happen."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"This \u201ccrash\u201d has produced some pretty spectacular work. Matt\u2019s sonifications have been heard across the world. Probably his most famous sonification is the clip you just heard."},{"author":"Russo","text":"We had to give the system a voice. It\u2019s not actually making any sound, but we can still hear the rhythm and harmony of this faraway solar system."},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Matt released this sonification in 2017 with astrophysicist Dan Tamayo and musician Andrew Santaguida. The response was overwhelming. The video got a ton of press and was written about in places such as the New York Times and Gizmodo."},{"author":"Russo","text":"It\u2019s always just overwhelming how much people connect with the sounds that we\u2019ve created [out] of these images. So it\u2019s an art form, but in the process, they are learning something about the astronomical system and also just about information and how you can experience the same information using two different senses."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"In the years since, Matt has gone on to create more sonifications and work with NASA, like this one of a black hole. [CLIP: \u201cM87 Jets\u201d by Matt Russo] If you want to join the fun and see Matt\u2019s very cute dog, he has a series explaining how to make your own sonifications.

He started the SYSTEM Sounds outreach project with Dan and Andrew to make sonifications."},{"author":"Russo","text":"We wanted to be able to convert astronomical images into sound, partially because we thought it was interesting and fun but also to make those images accessible to people that don\u2019t have sight, people who are blind or visually impaired."},{"author":"Broderick","text":"Russo\u2019s not the only one pushing for this. Astronomical sonification was started by a blind astronomer. We\u2019ll have more about that story in our next episode, but this was always the goal: expand our understanding of the stars\u2014especially for people with disabilities. "},{"author":"Drakeford","text":"Before we go, let\u2019s listen to an excerpt from a never-before-heard sonification of gravitational waves that Matt and Andrew made. Gravitational waves ripple across the fabric of space time thanks to big energy events, like a colliding black hole. These waves clue astronomers in to the structure and composition of the universe. Matt wanted to capture this.
