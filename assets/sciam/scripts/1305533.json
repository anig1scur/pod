      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": "I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t bite you, because ticks are more than just a nuisance\u2014they transmit serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Lyme disease, for example, is probably the one we\u2019re most familiar with, and it\u2019s the most common vectorborne disease in the U.S."

      "text": "Any disease spread by insects that bite or suck our blood, like ticks, mosquitoes or fleas. Lyme disease is primarily caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of the blacklegged tick\u2014more commonly known as the deer tick. This often results in a characteristic bull\u2019s eye rash, as well as flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and sometimes joint pain."

      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": "Yeah that\u2019s pretty awful. We actually know quite a lot about Lyme disease. Or at least more than other kinds of diseases spread by ticks. But today I want to talk about a different tickborne condition, which causes a particularly bizarre problem: an allergy to red meat, among other things. It\u2019s called alpha-gal syndrome. The tick bite causes an immune response to a sugar called galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose."

    },
    {
      "author": "Kersh",
      "text": "Alpha-gal syndrome is a tick-bite-associated allergic condition. We think people, after getting a tick bite, in the few weeks or maybe a couple of months after, they start having allergic reactions when they consume red meat or other products that contain the alpha-gal sugar."

I talked to him a couple weeks ago for a story about alpha-gal syndrome. He co-authored a couple of recent CDC reports about how widespread this condition is and what doctors know about it."

      "author": "Gilbert Kersh: ",
      "text": "There are other patients who have more traditional allergic reactions\u2014who will have hives\u2014and some develop anaphylaxis.

      "author": "Lewis: ",
