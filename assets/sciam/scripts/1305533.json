One of them even makes you allergic to red meat and dairy! [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I am terrified of ticks. I like to go hiking in the Hudson Valley, but I always try to wear long pants or use insect repellant. And I check for ticks when I come home."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"You\u2019re really actually sort of like shaking terrified of ticks? Why?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Well, I mean I especially worry about deer ticks because they carry Lyme disease. Those ticks are super common here in the Northeast. What about you, Josh?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Funny, I actually went to college not that far from Lyme, Connecticut where that disease got its name, and I wasn\u2019t that worried about it then. But now I\u2019ve got this dog with this dense, black fur."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Oh, you mean Kayla?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yep, good old Kayla. And it\u2019s very hard to see ticks in her fur because they\u2019re the same color. I once was brushing Kayla and I brushed one onto myself and I didn\u2019t see it for hours. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t bite me. It was just hanging out, dangling from my leg."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t bite you, because ticks are more than just a nuisance\u2014they transmit serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Lyme disease, for example, is probably the one we\u2019re most familiar with, and it\u2019s the most common vectorborne disease in the U.S."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Vectorborne means what exactly?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Any disease spread by insects that bite or suck our blood, like ticks, mosquitoes or fleas. Lyme disease is primarily caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of the blacklegged tick\u2014more commonly known as the deer tick. This often results in a characteristic bull\u2019s eye rash, as well as flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, fatigue, and sometimes joint pain."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Some people experience long-term chronic symptoms too, and those can include extreme fatigue or neurological issues."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah that\u2019s pretty awful. We actually know quite a lot about Lyme disease. Or at least more than other kinds of diseases spread by ticks. But today I want to talk about a different tickborne condition, which causes a particularly bizarre problem: an allergy to red meat, among other things. It\u2019s called alpha-gal syndrome. The tick bite causes an immune response to a sugar called galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Okay Tanya, you get the hard science word of the week."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I thought you\u2019d like that. The sugar, called alpha-gal for short, is present in most mammals\u00a0 except for humans and a few ape and monkey species."},{"author":"Kersh","text":"Alpha-gal syndrome is a tick-bite-associated allergic condition. We think people, after getting a tick bite, in the few weeks or maybe a couple of months after, they start having allergic reactions when they consume red meat or other products that contain the alpha-gal sugar."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s Gilbert Kersh, chief of the Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch at the CDC\u2019s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. How\u2019s that for a title? I talked to him a couple weeks ago for a story about alpha-gal syndrome. He co-authored a couple of recent CDC reports about how widespread this condition is and what doctors know about it."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019d never heard about this. A tick bite can make you allergic to hamburgers?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, strange as that may seem. Something that makes people eat less red meat might not sound so bad for the planet. But it\u2019s actually quite severe."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"What kind of symptoms do people get?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"They are really debilitating. The reactions include gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And it\u2019s not just beef, right?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right\u2014many mammalian products contain alpha-gal, like pork\u2026"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Bacon? Sausages?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yup."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Venison?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yup."},{"author":"Fishman","text":"Cheddar cheese? Regular milk?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, dairy too. It\u2019s even in gelatin!"},{"author":"Fishman","text":"So people with the syndrome could react to jello! And also, and maybe more importantly, pills like gel caps, which are made from gelatin."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s the tricky part. It\u2019s not like you can just stop eating red meat and you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s actually really hard to avoid all products that contain alpha-gal. The allergy can cause symptoms outside the digestive system, too."},{"author":"Gilbert Kersh: ","text":"There are other patients who have more traditional allergic reactions\u2014who will have hives\u2014and some develop anaphylaxis. They may have trouble breathing, swelling of the tongue, those kinds of symptoms\u2014which can be quite serious and often result in visits to the emergency department."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So, what kind of tick should we look out for? And where are they?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It\u2019s spread by the bite of the lone star tick, which is found in the U.S. South, Midwest and mid-Atlantic. The county with the most positive tests for alpha-gal syndrome is actually Suffolk County, on Long Island."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So, that\u2019s close to you New York City people."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It is. But it\u2019s not clear if there are really more cases here, or if there\u2019s just more awareness of the condition."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Is there any guesstimate about how many people actually have this allergy?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"According to a recent study by Kersh and his colleagues, there were more than 110,000 people in the U.S. who tested positive for alpha-gal antibodies from 2010 to 2022. But he thinks the actual number of cases is likely much higher."},{"author":"Kersh","text":"Lack of awareness among health care providers, we suspect that that 110,000 is quite a bit undercounting, and we estimate as many as 450,000 people may be living with alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S. The number of positive tests has been going up year by year."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"He mentioned lack of awareness. Do doctors really not know about this?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Some definitely don\u2019t. For a separate study, Kersh and his colleagues surveyed health care providers about their knowledge of alpha-gal syndrome and how to treat it."},{"author":"Kersh","text":"We did a survey of health care providers, and 42 percent of healthcare providers had not heard of alpha-gal. An additional 35 percent were not too confident in their ability to diagnose or manage a patient who had it."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Huh, so I\u2019m not the only one just learning about this. It\u2019s kind of new and mysterious to the people who I\u2019d go to for a diagnosis."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah it is. And there\u2019s no treatment. All you can do is avoid foods or medicines that contain alpha-gal. But some people experience fewer symptoms as time goes on."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"The best thing, I guess, is to avoid getting bitten by a tick in the first place."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Well, yes, that\u2019s always the best strategy. So make sure to wear that DEET, and make sure to remove any ticks if you do find them!"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"If you get bitten by a tick, the first thing to do is to remove the entire tick, using tweezers. And if you\u2019ve had a possible tick bite, or experience a rash or unusual symptoms, you should see your doctor."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Definitely. But given how widespread alpha-gal syndrome already is, getting doctors to recognize it is the next step."},{"author":"Kersh","text":"One of our objectives is to increase awareness about Alpha-gal syndrome, both among the public and among healthcare providers, so that this can be recognized and managed appropriately."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"It is just another reminder that if we ignore tickborne diseases, our ignorance may come back to bite us!
