This network is often called the \u201cwood wide web\u201d because it facilitates communication in the forest.

Jenny says that if they don\u2019t have as many fungi to trade with, trees don\u2019t do as well: they\u2019re often smaller, less resilient to stress and less likely to survive. So the experiment Jenny\u2019s working on is about trying to get more mycorrhizal fungi into urban soil. Yeah."

And unfortunately, it\u2019s been changing in ways that will probably feel really familiar\u2014because trees, like us,\u00a0 have been experiencing inflation. [CLIP: Music]"

But since the industrial revolution\u2014and especially in the past few decades\u2014humans have added lots more, essentially devaluing the plants\u2019 currency. To oversimplify, there are really two options for what happens next. Just as in the human world, the plant economy could course correct or it could crash. Obviously, the crash scenario is not great for the plants."

To use an economic term, the land sink for carbon is one of the things we factor into our global \u201ccarbon budget\u201d\u2014which helps us decide how much carbon we can burn without overshooting climate goals. And Renato says that if it weren\u2019t for this inconvenient problem of inflation ..."

      "text": "From the end of the century on, it seems like projections are saying that this productivity will start to decrease.

And then the feedback into the climate system will just amplify and accelerate climate change, which will be a disaster."

There\u2019s the uncertainty in the processes that we represent in these models. But there\u2019s also the uncertainty in the pathways that humans will take. So we might cut emissions by 2030, and then the climate system would take other pathways."

And that\u2019s even more true when the economy is actually underground\u2014when it\u2019s all happening under a layer of dirt. Right now Renato is extrapolating from a few research forests, like the one I visited. The problem: these forests are mostly near well-funded universities in the U.S. and Europe. So tropical rainforests are underrepresented."

But to be certain, we need better data on which fungi are where and how their relationships are shifting. In the next episode, we\u2019ll explore how researchers are getting those data. Because, as it turns out, they are in fact mapping these nearly invisible underground fungi. Here\u2019s the wild part: now, they\u2019re figuring out how to do that from space.
