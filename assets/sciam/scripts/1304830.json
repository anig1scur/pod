I\u2019m Christopher Intagliata. It\u2019s pretty much every kid\u2019s dream, or at least it was mine\u2026"},{"author":"Adam Wall: ","text":"Well, welcome Christopher, behind the scenes here in Crustacea."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"\u2026 you\u2019re at the natural history museum, and the scientists who work there are like, \u201cKid\u2014we\u2019re taking you behind the scenes.\u201d"},{"author":"Wall","text":"This is not part of what the public gets to see."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Well, on a recent evening, my childhood dreams came true as collections manager of crustaceans Adam Wall took me into the vaults of the Natural History Museum of LA."},{"author":"Wall","text":"This room, we consider to be incredibly valuable."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"These collections are the part of the museum that hides in the shadow of the massive T. rex and Triceratops skeletons, the part that\u2019s not as charismatic as the stuffed elephants and lions. It\u2019s a vast biological library\u2014shelves upon shelves upon shelves, tens of millions of specimens not on public display."},{"author":"Wall","text":"So we have things like coconut crabs. We have these absolutely alien looking rabbit-eared barnacle, then an acorn barnacle, which is this really traditional hard looking thing ..., and then also you have a little chunk of the whale skin that ... that barnacle is attached to."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And there\u2019s fairy shrimp, too, which I\u2019m kind of obsessed with \u2019cause of their Mad Max\u2013level abilities to withstand drought and fire and then just suddenly spring to life. Adam\u2019s got lots of them here."},{"author":"Wall","text":"We\u2019re gonna go look at undoubtedly the largest collection of endangered fairy shrimp in the world."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"This is incredibly valuable stuff. He says this room alone is insured for $600 million. And it\u2019s built to last, with special lights and electrical switches."},{"author":"Wall: \u200b\u200b","text":"It\u2019s a very similar setup that you would have in, like, an oil refinery. And the reason for that is there are hundreds of thousands of gallons of 95 percent ethanol in this room that we use to preserve specimens."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Ethanol is also highly flammable."},{"author":"Wall","text":"So in this room, if there is an earthquake, we don\u2019t want there to be sparks, \u2019cause that's... how you lose museums in fires."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"He turns big wheels on the sides of the shelves to roll them apart,"},{"author":"Wall","text":"Those things that you have in your local library, so you can fit even more books into a small space \u2026"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"\u2026 and exposes a tower of fairy shrimp samples. The shelves are like twice as tall as me, crammed with labeled jars like condiments on a fridge door."},{"author":"Wall","text":"This particular specimen is from ... San Diego County and is Branchinecta lindahli.... And we have the whole community represented as one jar, which is from ... America, California, San Diego County, Proctor Valley.... And then it tells us the exact size of the mesh, of the net that it was collected on."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"That\u2019s really cool. So it really is like a snapshot of a moment in time at a very specific place."},{"author":"Wall","text":"Exactly.... and we\u2019re incredibly happy to be the repository for vernal pool fairy shrimp in southern California."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Kind of looks like you\u2019re running outta room, though."},{"author":"Wall","text":"Don\u2019t, don\u2019t talk about it. Every collections manager in this place is running out of room. I am, and specifically for the fairy shrimp, I\u2019m gonna have to, like, move everything and make some more room."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The reason the museum needs to make room for these fairy shrimp samples is pretty much the same reason the museum needs to make room for samples of anything. It\u2019s to keep these relics from a particular time and place on Earth so future scientists can answer the questions we still don\u2019t know we need to ask."},{"author":"Wall","text":"It\u2019s just really important to have these snapshots of the biodiversity through time."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That\u2019s exactly why this collection is so valuable. For example, they have crabs collected at Pacific atolls before and after nuclear bombing tests in the 1940s and 1950s. Nobody\u2019s ever going to be able to sample those pre-explosion crabs again."},{"author":"Wall","text":"It is a time machine that allows to go to places that don\u2019t exist, to ecosystems that have been destroyed or to just very conveniently go and look at the biodiversity that exists in Madagascar because we had that on a shelf, and we can walk around and look at it instead of getting on a plane and dealing with all the hassles of international travel."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And in the case of vernal pools, because so many have already been destroyed, a jar sitting on the shelf here might be the only record left of the biodiversity that once existed in a particular pond. And it\u2019s just waiting there for a scientist to discover it. But aside from all these jars, Adam had promised over e-mail to show me some real live fairy shrimp, too. [CLIP: Museum hallway ambiance]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So we head back to his lab on the other side of the museum through a maze of hallways and galleries and stairwells ..."},{"author":"Wall","text":"Up this ... set of stairs, which is part of the original ... part of the museum, into the grand rotunda."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The rotunda is truly stunning: marble columns and walls, a stained glass skylight overhead and, at the center, a bronze statue of three muses, Art, History and Science, holding up a glowing orb. It\u2019s pretty cool."},{"author":"Wall","text":"But anyways\u2026 [CLIP: Lab ambiance]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Back at Adam\u2019s lab, there are yet more vials sitting on one of the lab benches\u2014samples field researchers have sent to the museum. Remember how he\u2019s running out of room in the collection vault? He grabs one of the vials and takes a closer look."},{"author":"Wall","text":"It\u2019s really cool. This is actually the resting eggs from that species.... And if you were to take this sample and expose it to rainwater and the right conditions..., it mimics when it\u2019s the right time to hatch in that pool in that part of the world.... You would actually get baby fairy shrimp in, like, 24 hours..."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Luckily, he\u2019s already thought ahead."},{"author":"Wall","text":"You wanna look at some babies\u2014baby fairy shrimp that just hatched out an hour ago or so?"},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"That sounds fun. Okay."},{"author":"Wall","text":"I know, babies\u2026"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"In the other room, he shows me a big glass jar with a flashlight shining on it. It\u2019s full of tiny specks."},{"author":"Wall","text":"If you can see anything that\u2019s moving right now, then those are larvae, and they\u2019ll be concentrated around this light because they\u2019re phototactic as larvae\u2026"},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Oh, oh, my gosh.... There\u2019s a couple of \u2019em right there, it looks like."},{"author":"Wall","text":"And there\u2019s that one right there. It\u2019s just, like, doing crazy barrel rolls and stuff. Um, yeah. I super love these things. They are crazy."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"It\u2019s hard to see much without magnification, but he has a microscope set up on another bench."},{"author":"Wall","text":"Over here we have the Ferrari of microscopes. It\u2019s, like, a $40,000 dissecting scope.... I think we cried a little bit when we finally got it."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"There\u2019s a video screen where we can see four baby fairy shrimp flitting around, spinning circles around themselves."},{"author":"Wall","text":"The only real appendages it has are these antennae, but it\u2019s actually using them for locomotion, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s swimming around.... These totally look like some video game from, like, the 1980s spaceship kind of a thing."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"He\u2019s right. It looks right out of Atari\u2019s Space Invaders. [CLIP: Space Invaders theme]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And if it\u2019s not clear already, these fairy shrimp are tiny but truly mighty."},{"author":"Shannon Blair: ","text":"They\u2019ve lived through the breakup of Pangea. They\u2019ve lived through the K-T extinction. They\u2019ve lived through the meteor that killed the dinosaurs."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"In the next episode, we\u2019ll talk to scientists such as Shannon Blair about the one thing that\u2019s putting the resilience of these hardcore survivors to the test: human development.
