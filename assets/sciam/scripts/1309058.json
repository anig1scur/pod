I remember being taught the rhyme, \u201cRed touches black, you\u2019re okay, Jack; red touches yellow, you\u2019re a dead fellow,\u201d in elementary school\u2014never mind the fact that we did not have coral snakes in New Jersey.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"My guest today has spent a lot of time exploring our cultural aversion to\u2014and fascination with\u2014snakes. Stephen S. Hall is a science writer and the author of seven books. He\u2019s also a teacher of science communication at New York University, Rockefeller University and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. His latest book, Slither: How Nature\u2019s Most Maligned Creatures Illuminate Our World, is on sale now."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for coming in to chat. I\u2019m really looking forward to it."},{"author":"Stephen S. Hall","text":"My pleasure to be here. Thank you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"First question: Why snakes?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"There\u2019s several answers to that question. One of them is that as a kid, like many kids, I caught snakes, brought them home, put them in terrariums in the garage until my mother screamed when they would get loose, and that sort of ended that experiment. I was always fascinated by them because they were so different from other animals\u2014and also so beautiful. There was a real fascination and attraction there. But I wasn\u2019t a herper; I didn\u2019t go out and continue to collect snakes."},{"author":"","text":"What I did do is become a science writer, and probably in the 2000s and 2010s, when I was reading science journals like Science and Nature, I occasionally would run across these really interesting major research articles based on snakes, and I always sort of set them aside, thinking, \u201cThis is kind of interesting. I should gather a little pile on this.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"The third piece of this explanation is that my agent suggested at one point, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do a book about an animal?\u201d which I had never done before. And my first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019d only do a book about an animal that most people don\u2019t like,\u201d because I thought it\u2019d be a really interesting challenge to try to change people\u2019s minds. And as most people know snakes are not very popular. People do not like them\u2014they\u2019re afraid of them; they loathe them; there\u2019re all these surveys that children detest snakes and adults detest snakes\u2014and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to change people\u2019s minds about a really interesting creature.\u00a0"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. Given your research for the book, how have our feelings about snakes evolved over time?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"One of the things that surprised me is: this deeply embedded loathing of snakes was not always the case. In fact, that was the later evolution from earlier cultures, and part of the fun of doing Slither was going back and seeing how ancient cultures perceive snakes, and they perceived them very differently."},{"author":"","text":"They were respected. They were venerated in some cultures. In, in early ancient Greek culture the snake was associated with healing. In Mesoamerican cultures the snake was associated with a kind of messenger that would go back and forth between humans and nature but also humans and the afterworld\u2014the world of the nonliving, as it were. There was a great respect for these creatures. This was also true in ancient Egypt. And then [laughs] with the Garden of Eden story the snake got demonized and was blamed for human fallibility, human sin, and I think that changed a lot of perceptions."},{"author":"","text":"One of the goals that I was trying to accomplish here was to get people to rethink what snakes represent: Why did ancient people venerate them, and is there a way to reclaim that sense of respect for these otherwise disliked creatures?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, and what do you think it is about snakes that made them venerated, and what do you think it is about them that makes people feel so negatively towards them?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"In terms of the negative part they are so different from so many other creatures: They don\u2019t have legs. They\u2019re secretive. You can\u2019t see them. They\u2019re [laughs] extremely good at hiding. In fact, you know, there\u2014it\u2019s sort of a Darwinian badge of honor that they make themselves hard to see, with their camouflage skin, and coloration, and so on. So they represent a kind of extreme version of the other. And people also associate threat and danger with them, certainly with venomous snakes."},{"author":"","text":"One of the interesting things that came up in the research\u2014it\u2019s a really interesting theory called the snake-detection theory. This is advanced by a researcher at the University of California, Davis, named Lynne Isbell. Isbell argues that the necessity of spotting snakes in the wild as a self-preservation mechanism led to the creation of a much larger primate brain, which we humans have inherited as well. So she attributes human acuity in vision to spotting snakes in [an] evolutionary sense that was developed a long time ago."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I\u2019ve also seen that as an explanation for why cats are freaked out by cucumbers; I\u2019ll have to fact-check that. But that\u2019s not [laughs] anything I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve heard that theory brought up before in the context of cats running away from cucumbers [laughs], so."},{"author":"Hall","text":"There\u2019s some ingrained perception."},{"author":"","text":"Charles Darwin read a report by a German scientist\u2014this is in the middle of the 19th century\u2014that he had taken snakes to the monkey house in a zoo in Germany, and the monkeys went crazy just seeing that there was a snake in it when he revealed it. So Darwin puts a stuffed snake in a bag and goes to the London Zoo, and then he takes off the top, and all the monkeys go crazy, and he\u2019d never seen a reaction like that. Then he went back with a live snake, and the same thing happened, and it was this sort of instantaneous reaction to the appearance of a snake, so there\u2019s definitely an alarm system ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hall","text":"We don\u2019t need to say that it was fear, necessarily, although some people call it a \u201cfear module,\u201d but there\u2019s an alarm system in spotting a snake that I think is connected to the alarm that many humans feel when they see a snake."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, and speaking of Darwin\u2019s kind of crude research, how has our scientific understanding of snakes changed over time?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"Scientists are belatedly using snakes as a nontraditional model organism."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hall","text":"You would think that there was not much you could learn from a snake, but they\u2019ve actually discovered some remarkable qualities in snakes because they finally started paying attention to them with the advent of molecular biology. What used to be observed naturalistically\u2014okay, a snake eats a large prey and digests it\u2014and they would take x-rays of it, like, in the 1970s; that was how metabolism was explained. After genomics emerged and they did the genome of the snake after the Human Genome Project, they discovered that snakes, pythons, as a model organism activate a huge suite of genes from the moment that they have a meal. And they were particularly interesting organisms to study because\u2014I facetiously kinda say they invented intermittent fasting [laughs]\u2014but, but they could go for a year at a time without eating a single meal. And then they eat these enormous meals. So the equivalence was, like, a 150-pound human, for example, roughly, eating a 220-pound hamburger ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm [laughs]."},{"author":"Hall","text":"\u201cIn one gulp.\u201d That\u2019s kind of what the meal of a python was like. How does an animal handle the digestion and processing of that? It turns out they activate all these genes that regenerate tissues in the body\u2014a bigger heart, a bigger intestine\u2014just to handle the [laughs] massive processing of this meal. And then they carve away all the regenerated tissue that they\u2019ve created and go back to normal. So they have this ability to regenerate tissue, which, of course, is something we can\u2019t do, except in a couple of isolated cases, and it became a really interesting thing to study."},{"author":"","text":"Another thing that\u2019s really interesting is convergent evolution: this idea that animals can evolve the same traits, although they\u2019re completely unrelated. So there was a study that came out a couple years ago on spitting cobras. The researchers established that three different lineages of cobras that were completely independent of each other each evolved the anatomical mechanism to spit venom\u2014a physiological change. They evolved the behavior to aim the spit at the eyes of whatever it was that was threatening them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Hall","text":"And they independently evolved a change in their venom that produced excruciating pain in eyes. So independently all three of those different qualities were evolved in three different species of snakes that were completely unrelated to each other, in a sense. You couldn\u2019t have found that out until you had genomics and very sophisticated molecular analysis of venom and all that stuff."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. What were some of the most surprising things that you learned in this project as someone who already really had a fondness for snakes?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"The thing that really impressed me is how adaptive snakes are, how rapidly they adjust to their environment; it\u2019s one of their signal traits. They\u2019re very diverse\u2014it\u2019s amazing that they can live on every continent except Antarctica, which means temperate, cold weather, tropical weather, jungle, seawater. If there\u2019s a threat in the environment, they have these remarkably ingenious evolutionary adaptations to it. There\u2019s a story of these sea snakes in, in the Pacific off New Caledonia that, in response to the pollution in the waters there, have developed melanistic characteristics\u2014a darker coloration in their skin\u2014because that sequesters all these toxic chemicals that are in the water and prevents it from harming the animal, and then they slough off their skin and they get rid of the chemicals. And it\u2019s only in those snakes that are inhabiting that particular niche."},{"author":"","text":"This idea of being able to adapt to environmental challenge really struck me, not just because of the cleverness of the evolution or the selective process, but also, it\u2019s a warning to us in terms of climate change and changes in the global meteorological systems. Snakes have a way of adapting to this that we don\u2019t have, and maybe we can learn something from them. It\u2019s really interesting that in the Mesoamerican cultures in particular, snakes were traditionally associated with meteorological events ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hall","text":"So rain, lightning, thunderstorms, droughts, floods, and all of that being attached to agricultural fertility. And these are all issues that are front and center now because of climate change, and I think the ancients realized that snakes were symbols of coming to terms with both the unpredictability of nature and perhaps suggesting ways to adapt to it."},{"author":"","text":"I spoke to a very well-known Australian herpetologist named Rick Shine. He did fieldwork in [the mountains of] Tasmania, which has horrible weather, and there are snakes there, and, you know, he said there\u2019s only 20 or 30 really nice sunny days there. And humans go there, and they think, \u201cThis is the most god-awful environment. How could anything live here?\u201d And the snakes live under the rocks for all but those 20 or 30 days, and then they come out, and they think they\u2019re living in the villa by the sea [laughs], and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a sunny day for them; they don\u2019t have the sense that it\u2019s a bad environment because they adjust to it. And he had this wonderful observation\u2014he just wondered what it felt like for a snake to emerge into the sunlight, warm up, have all its organ systems click on, its consciousness click on. He said, \u201cThat must be an amazing feeling.\u201d And I thought that was a wonderful way of kind of capturing the uniqueness of these creatures."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and speaking of that adaptation, what dangers are snakes facing these days?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"I would say the biggest danger\u2019s habitat destruction. And there are a couple of anecdotes in the book\u2014so I talk about when I caught snakes as a kid, and this was in a sort of exurban area of Michigan, outside Detroit. I went back to that area 50 years later to see how the habitat had changed, and all the places where you would catch turtles or you catch snakes or you would see them, it\u2019s all changed: It\u2019s been developed residentially. Population spread has confined the habitat."},{"author":"","text":"Thomas Cole, who\u2019s a pretty famous Hudson River School painter, had made the point that a habitat destruction was something that needed to be addressed or, as he put it, we would lose Eden and wouldn\u2019t be able to recover it again."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Why do you think people should care about snakes?"},{"author":"Hall","text":"I think it\u2019s really important, when we talk about conservation, preservation of species, prevention of extinction, that we don\u2019t only think about cute animals that everybody likes. It\u2019s really important to globally embrace all creatures\u2014including, in this case, that animal that is so different and so repulsive and historically so loathed by so many people\u2014because if we pick and choose, we\u2019re really not saving anything in terms of habitat or anything else."},{"author":"","text":"And it\u2019s an acknowledgement that ecologies are complicated, that there are these very fragile webs, and it\u2019s not just birds or mammals or snakes, but it\u2019s the combination and interaction of these creatures that creates a vibrant and sustainable ecology. It\u2019s really important to include everyone in our conservation arc, if you will."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely.

He said, \u201cThat must be an amazing feeling.\u201d And I thought that was a wonderful way of kind of capturing the uniqueness of these creatures."]},{"begin":"813.720","end":"819.720","lines":["Yeah, well, and speaking of that adaptation, what dangers are snakes facing these days?"]},{"begin":"819.720","end":"849.360","lines":["I would say the biggest danger\u2019s habitat destruction. And there are a couple of anecdotes in the book\u2014so I talk about when I caught snakes as a kid, and this was in a sort of exurban area of Michigan, outside Detroit. I went back to that area 50 years later to see how the habitat had changed, and all the places where you would catch turtles or you catch snakes or you would see them, it\u2019s all changed: It\u2019s been developed residentially. Population spread has confined the habitat."]},{"begin":"849.360","end":"864.360","lines":["Thomas Cole, who\u2019s a pretty famous Hudson River School painter, had made the point that a habitat destruction was something that needed to be addressed or, as he put it, we would lose Eden and wouldn\u2019t be able to recover it again."]},{"begin":"864.360","end":"867.400","lines":["Why do you think people should care about snakes?"]},{"begin":"867.400","end":"896.920","lines":["I think it\u2019s really important, when we talk about conservation, preservation of species, prevention of extinction, that we don\u2019t only think about cute animals that everybody likes. It\u2019s really important to globally embrace all creatures\u2014including, in this case, that animal that is so different and so repulsive and historically so loathed by so many people\u2014because if we pick and choose, we\u2019re really not saving anything in terms of habitat or anything else."]},{"begin":"896.920","end":"919.680","lines":["And it\u2019s an acknowledgement that ecologies are complicated, that there are these very fragile webs, and it\u2019s not just birds or mammals or snakes, but it\u2019s the combination and interaction of these creatures that creates a vibrant and sustainable ecology.
