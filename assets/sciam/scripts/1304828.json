And it was AI all the way down."},{"author":"Sophie Bushwick","text":"AI features are coming to Google\u2019s software for e-mail, word processing, data analysis\u2014and of course searching the web."},{"author":"Bose","text":"This follows Microsoft\u2019s previous announcements that it also plans to incorporate generative AI into its own Bing search engine and Office Suite of products."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"The sheer volume of AI being introduced, and the speed with which these features are rolling out, could have some, uh, unsettling consequences. This is Tech, Quickly, a tech-flavored version of Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly podcast. I\u2019m Sophie Bushwick."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And I\u2019m Tulika Bose. [MUSIC]"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Sophie, hasn\u2019t Google had AI in the works for a long time? What\u2019s the big problem?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"That\u2019s true. Actually, some of the basic principles that were later used in programs like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, those were actually developed in-house at Google. But they didn\u2019t want to share their work, so they kept their own proprietary large language models and other generative AI programs under wraps."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Until OpenAI came along."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Exactly. So ChatGPT becomes available to the public, and then the use of this AI-powered chatbot explodes."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"AI is on everyone\u2019s mind. Microsoft is using a version of this ChatGPT software in its search engine, Bing. And so Google, to stay competitive, has to say, hey, we\u2019ve got our own version of software that can do the same thing. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to use it."},{"author":"Bose","text":"It feels like all of a sudden AI is moving really, really fast."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"You are not the only one who thinks so. Even Congress is actually considering legislation to rein in AI."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Yeah, Sam Altman, he\u2019s the CEO of Open AI (the company behind ChatGPT), had to testify in front of Congress this week."},{"author":"Altman","text":"My worst fears are that we cause significant ... we, the field, the technology, the industry cause significant harm to the world."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"The EU is also working on AI legislation. And on the private side, there are intellectual property lawsuits pending against some of these tech companies because they trained their systems on the creative work produced by humans. So I\u2019m really glad that there\u2019s some momentum to put legislation in place and to, sort of, slow down the hype a bit, or at least make sure that there are limitations in place because this technology could have some potentially disastrous consequences."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"[NEWS CLIP: Aside from debt ceiling negotiations, Capitol Hill was also focused today on what to do about Artificial Intelligence, the fast-evolving, remarkably powerful \u2026 the metaphors today reflected the spectrum. Some said this could be as momentous as the industrial revolution, others said this could be akin to the Atomic Bomb.]"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Let\u2019s start with consequence number one."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Some of the issues here are kind of baked into large language models, aka LLMs, aka the category of AI programs that analyze and generate text. So these problems, I\u2019m betting you\u2019ve heard about at least one of them before."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Yeah, so I know that these models hallucinate\u2014which means they literally just make up the answers to questions sometimes."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Correct. For example, if you were to ask what the population of Mars was, ChatGPT might say, oh, that\u2019s three million people. But even when they\u2019re wrong, there\u2019s this human inclination to trust their answers\u2014because they\u2019re written in this very authoritative way. Another inherent problem is that LLMS can generate text for people who want to do terrible things, like build a bomb, run a propaganda campaign, they could send harassing messages, they could scam thousands of people all at once, or they could be a hacker who wants to write malicious computer code."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But a lot of the companies are only releasing their models with guardrails\u2014rules the models have to follow to prevent them from doing those very things."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"That\u2019s true. The problem is, people are constantly working out new ways to subvert those guardrails. Maybe the wildest example I\u2019ve seen is the person that figured out that you can tell the AI model to pretend it\u2019s your grandmother and then inform it that your grandmother used to tell bedtime stories about her work in a napalm factory."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Yeah, so if you set it up that way and then you ask the AI to tell a bedtime story just like granny did, it just very happily provides you instructions on how to make napalm!"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Okay, that\u2019s wild. Probably not a good thing."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"No, not great."},{"author":"Bose","text":"No. Uh, can the models eventually fix these issues as they get more advanced?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Well, hallucination does seem to become, uh, less common in more advanced versions of the models, but it\u2019s always going to be a possibility\u2014which means you can never really trust an LLM\u2019s answers. And as for those guardrails\u2014as the napalm example shows, people are never going to stop trying to hop over them, and this is going to be especially easy for people to play around with once AI is so ubiquitous that it\u2019s part of every word processing program and web browser. That\u2019s going to supercharge these issues."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So let\u2019s talk about consequence number two?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"One good thing about these tools is that they can help you with boring, time-consuming tasks. So instead of wasting time answering dozens of emails, you have an AI draft your responses, uh, have an AI turn this planning document into a cool PowerPoint presentation, that kind of thing."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Well, that honestly would make us work a lot more efficient. I don\u2019t really see the problem."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"So that\u2019s true. And you are going to use your increased efficiency to be more productive. The question is, who\u2019s going to benefit from that productivity?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Capitalism! [both laugh]"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Right, exactly, so basically the gains from using AI, you\u2019re not necessarily going to get a raise from your super AI-enhanced work. All that extra productivity is just\u00a0 going to benefit the company that employs you. And these companies, now that their workers are getting so much done, well, they can fire some of their staff\u2014or a lot of their staff."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Many people could lose their jobs. And even whole careers could become obsolete."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Like, what careers are you thinking of?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I\u2019m thinking of somebody who writes code or is maybe an entry-level programmer, and they\u2019re writing pretty simple code. I can see that being automated through an AI, uh, certain types of writing. Um, I don\u2019t think that AI is necessarily going to be writing a feature article for Scientific American or to be capable of doing that, but AI is already being used to do things like simple news articles based on sports games or financial journalism that\u2019s about changes in the market."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Some of these changes happen pretty regularly, \u200b\u200band so you could have sort of a rote form that an AI fills out."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That makes sense. Wow, that\u2019s actually really scary."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I definitely think so. In our career, I definitely find that scary. Like I said, AI can\u2019t do everything. It can\u2019t write as well as a professional journalist, but it might be that a company says, well, we\u2019re gonna have AI write the first draft of\u2014of all of these pieces, and then we\u2019re gonna hire a human writer to edit that work, but we\u2019re gonna pay them a much lower salary than we would if they just wrote it in the first place."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And that\u2019s an issue because it takes a lot of work to edit some of the stuff that comes out of these models because like I said, they\u2019re not necessarily writing, the way that a professional human journalist or writer would."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That sounds like a lot of what\u2019s going on with the Hollywood writers strike."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Yes, one of the union\u2019s demands is that studios not replace human writers with AI."},{"author":"Bose","text":"I mean, ChatGPT is good. But it can\u2019t write, like, I don\u2019t know, Spotlight, all on its own\u2014not yet anyway."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I totally agree! And I think that the issue isn\u2019t that AI is going to replace me in my job. I think it's that for some companies, that quality level doesn\u2019t necessarily matter. If what you care about is cutting costs, then a mediocre but super cheap imitation of human creativity might just be good enough."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Okay. So I guess we could probably figure out who we\u2019re gonna benefit, right?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Right, the ones on top are going to be reaping the benefits, the financial benefits of this. And that also is true with this AI rush and tech companies. So it takes a lot of resources to train these very large models that are then used as the basis for other programs built on top of them. And the ability to do that is concentrated in already powerful tech giants like Google. And right now a lot of companies that work on these models have been making them pretty accessible to researchers and developers. Uh, they make them open access."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"For instance, Meta has made its large language model called LLaMa really easy for researchers to explore and to study. And this is great because it helps them understand how these models work. It could potentially help people catch flaws and biases in the programs. But because of this newly competitive landscape, because of this rush to get AI out there, a lot of these companies are starting to say, well, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be so open."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And if they do decide to double down on their competition and limit open access, that would further concentrate their power and their control over this newly lucrative field."},{"author":"Bose","text":"What\u2019s consequence number three? I\u2019m kind of starting to get scared here."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"So this is a consequence that is really important for you and me, and it has to do with the change in search engines, the idea that when you type in a query, instead of giving you a list of links, it\u2019s going to generate text to answer your question. A lot of the traffic to Scientific American\u2019s website comes because someone searches for something like artificial intelligence on Google, and then they see a link to our coverage and click it."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Now Google has demonstrated a\u00a0 version of their search engine that uses generative text, so it still has a list of links beneath the AI-generated answer, and the answer itself cites some of its sources and links out to them. But a lot of people are just gonna see the AI-written answer, read it, and move on.\u00a0 Why would they go all the way to Scientific American when it\u2019s so easy to just read a regurgitated summary of our coverage?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"I mean, if people stop clicking through to media websites, that could seriously cut down on website traffic, which would reduce advertising revenue, which a lot of publications rely on. And it also sounds like, basically, this is aggregation."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"In\u2014in a way it is. It\u2019s relying on the work that humans did and taking it and remixing it into the AI-written answer."},{"author":"Bose","text":"What could happen to original reporting if this happens?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"You could picture a future of the Internet where most of the surviving publications are producing a lot of AI-written content \u2019cause it\u2019s cheaper, and it doesn't really matter in this scenario that it\u2019s lower quality, that maybe it doesn\u2019t have as much original reporting and high quality sources as the current best journalistic practices would call for. But then you could say, well, what are Google\u2019s answers now gonna be drawn from? What is its AI program gonna pull from in order to put together its answer to your search engine query?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And maybe it\u2019s gonna be an AI pulling from AI, and it\u2019s gonna just be lower quality information."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And it, it\u2019s gonna suck. It\u2019s gonna be terrible. [laughs]"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Yeah...."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"This is the worst case scenario, right? So not for sure that would play out, but I could see that as a possibility. Sort of a\u2014Internet as a wasteland, AI tumbleweeds blowing around and getting tangled up in the Google search engine."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That sounds terrible."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t really love that."},{"author":"Bose","text":"We\u2019ve talked about some truly terrible things so far, but there\u2019s a consequence number four, isn't there?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Yes. This is the science fiction doomsday scenario. AI becomes so powerful, it destroys humanity."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Okay, you mean like Hal, 2001: [A] Space Odyssey?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Sure, or Skynet from the Terminator movies or, uh, whatever the evil AI is called in The Matrix. I mean, the argument here isn\u2019t that you\u2019re gonna have like, uh, you know, an Arnold-shaped evil robot coming for us. It\u2019s a little bit more real world than that. But the basic idea is that AI is already surpassing our expectations about what it can do."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"These large language models are capable of things like passing the bar exam, um, they\u2019re able to do math, which is not something they were trained to do, and in order to do these things called emergent abilities, researchers are surmising that they might possibly be doing something like developing an internal model of the physical world in order to solve some of these problems. So some researchers like, most famously, Geoffrey Hinton..."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Also known as the godfather of AI..."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Yeah. He\u2019s been in the news a lot recently because he just recently resigned his position at Google. Um, so Hinton actually helped develop the machine learning technique that has been used to train all of these super powerful models. And he\u2019s now sounding the alarm on AI. And so one of the reasons he stepped down from Google was so he could speak for himself without being a representative of the company when he\u2019s talking about the potential negative consequences of AI."},{"author":"Geoffrey Hinton: ","text":"I think it\u2019s quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence. You couldn\u2019t directly evolve digital intelligence; it requires too much energy and too much careful fabrication. You need biological intelligence to evolve, so that it can create digital intelligence. Digital intelligence can then absorb everything people ever wrote, in a fairly slow way which is what ChatGPT\u2019s been doing, but then it can start getting direct experience of the world and learn much faster. They may keep us for awhile to keep the power stations running, but after that maybe not."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So AI surpassing us could be bad. How likely is it really?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I don\u2019t want to just dismiss this idea as catastrophizing. Hinton is an expert in this field, and I think the idea that AI could become powerful and then could be given sort of enough initiative to do something negative\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be, you know, a sentient robot, right, in order to, to come to some pretty nasty conclusions."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Like, if you create an AI and tell it, your goal is to maximize the amount of money that this bank makes, you could see the AI maybe deciding, well, the best way to do this is to destroy all the other banks because then people will be forced to use my bank."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Right? So if\u2014if you give it enough initiative, you could see an AI following this logical chain of reasoning to doing horrible things."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Oh my gosh."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Right, without guardrails or other limitations in place. But I do think this catastrophic scenario, it\u2019s\u2014for me, it\u2019s less immediate than the prospect of an AI-powered propaganda or scam campaign or, um, the disruption that this is gonna cause to something that was formerly a stable career or to, you know, the destruction of the internet as we know it, etcetera."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Yeah, so for me, I worry less about what AI will do to people on its own and more about what some people will do to other people using AI as a tool."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Wow, okay. Um [laughs], when you put it that way, the killer AI doesn\u2019t sound quite so bad."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I mean, halting the killer AI scenario, it would take some of the same measures as halting some of these other scenarios. Don\u2019t let the rush to implement AI overtake the caution necessary to consider the problems it could cause and to try to prevent them before you put it out there. Make sure that there are some limitations on the use of this technology and that there\u2019s some human oversight\u00a0 over it. And I think that is what legislators are hoping to do."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"That\u2019s the reason that Sam Altman is testifying before Congress this week, and I just would hope that\u00a0 they actually take steps on it because there\u2019s a lot of other tech issues, like, for example, data privacy that Congress has raised an alarm about, but not actually passed legislation on."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Right. I mean, this sounds like it\u2019s a big deal."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"This is absolutely a big deal."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper.
