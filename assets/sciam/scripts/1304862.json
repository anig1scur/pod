[NEWS CLIP] Concern at the Jersey Shore after yet another whale washed up on an Atlantic City beach."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Dead whales have started washing up on shores again \u2014 many over the last winter. [NEWS CLIP] More whales are washing up on the East Coast this weekend and now marine conservation groups are trying to figure out why it\u2019s happening."},{"author":"Bose","text":"It all begs the question \u2014 do we need to save the whales again?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly \u2014 I\u2019m Tulika Bose. [Bumper]"},{"author":"Joy Reidenberg: ","text":"What's happening right now is what's called an unusual mortality event. That is the official name for an unusual number of dead animals washing up of a particular species."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That\u2019s Joy Reidenberg. She\u2019s a comparative anatomist and a scientist that also does whale necropsies \u2014 or in layman\u2019s terms, whale autopsies."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"So when an animal washes ashore dead, the first thing we do is we examine the outside of the body. Why did the animal die, and what can we learn from its body?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Though scientists can\u2019t confirm what\u2019s causing this unusual mortality event \u2014 there\u2019s something that Joy can tell us about the dead whales."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"Many of them seem to have some kind of indication that they\u2019ve been killed through an interaction with humans. And that interaction is actually mostly ship strikes."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And to really verify what\u2019s killed the whale, Joy and a team have to dig inside the body of the whale itself."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"What we look for is, is there any evidence that there was bleeding at the site of the injury."},{"author":"Bose","text":"This by the way \u2014 isn\u2019t easy.\u00a0 A fully grown humpback whale, for example, can weigh up to 80,000 pounds and be as long as a schoolbus."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"So when the whale is in the path of a ship, it can actually bend the whale completely in half and break its spine, it can crush its ribcage and crush the vital organs inside, and then it can have slices through its body and those slices can be fatal if they slice through deep enough."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But ship strikes don\u2019t always tell the whole story."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"If we look at the tissues and we don\u2019t see evidence of bleeding, or bruising which is of course caused by blood vessels rupturing and causing this bloody stain inside the tissue, then the animal was hit after it was already dead \u2014 because a dead animal doesn\u2019t bleed. It could be that the animal was already dead and it just got run over by a ship. In which case those slice marks might have not happened to a live animal."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And that\u2019s because there are also other human interactions with whales that kill them besides ship strikes alone."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"Such as they could get tangled up in fishing gear. They often can't swim very well, they can't feed very well, especially if the lines wrap around the mouth, and the animal could actually die of starvation."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Not to mention \u2014 whales also get sick from viruses and bacterial infections."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"So \u2014 sometimes figuring out what the cause of death is can be extremely hard."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But \u2014 there\u2019s something that Joy wants to clarify, as a scientist. Wind farms have been getting a lot of attention lately for allegedly playing a role in the recent spate of whale deaths. [NEWS CLIP] Too many dead whales are washing ashore, and that has activists calling on President Biden to offshore \u2014 to do something about offshore wind energy activity."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"That\u2019s because things that generate sound in the water can interfere with a whale\u2019s ability to hear and can even affect their ability to communicate with other whales."},{"author":"Bose","text":"However \u2014 Joy says that something doesn\u2019t add up."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"Right now there is no data to support that the wind farm industries, whether it's the wind farms themselves, or the seismic surveys that are done to determine where to place a wind farm have any effect on these whales."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Here\u2019s why."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"Those sounds are not in the frequency range that these whales hear. So it's unlikely that that's causing their deafness."},{"author":"Bose","text":"In fact\u00a0 \u2014 Joy has another explanation for what could be causing the sudden increase in whale deaths. It\u2019s not what you might think."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"What's probably the leading reason for the unusual mortality event is that we've done such a good job conserving these whales that their population has grown. So having such a large number of whales in the area means that if a certain proportion of a population is going to die anyway from natural causes, that\u00a0number is going to be an absolutely higher number if your population is bigger."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Joy has even more guesses as to why so many whales could be dying."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"Are the whales staying in our area longer than they should be? Is something happening with their migrations? Something related to climate change? Is it related to the fact that whales are feeding in areas that are shipping lanes and now there are just more of them, so they\u2019re getting hit by the ships?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"It\u2019s important to note that online shopping during the Covid Pandemic led to record-making increases in cargo shipments along the East Coast last year, which is where and when a lot of the whales stranded. And \u2014 there are a lot of injured whales swimming around that have had contact with ships."},{"author":"Reidenberg","text":"There are many whales still swimming around today that have slice marks on them from encounters with propellers. Damage that is significant, but it's not lethal. So for example, lopping off a tail is pretty significant damage, but it won't kill the whale."},{"author":"Bose","text":"By the way, data on this is being collected and tracked at the National Marine Fisheries service. And \u2014 it might just mean we need to save the whales again."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Thanks for listening. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Tulika Bose.
