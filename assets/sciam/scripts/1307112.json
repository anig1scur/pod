On this show, we\u2019ve been talking about uncertainty from a variety of different angles. We\u2019ve heard how uncertainty can be a spark for creativity and scientific discovery. We\u2019ve discussed how uncertainty can go unseen and make science really difficult. And we\u2019ve explored some of the research techniques and habits of mind that researchers use to deal with uncertainty. Today we\u2019re going to end with two final questions: If science is always uncertain, how can we ever know anything? How can we have confidence in science if there\u2019s always underlying uncertainty? For help with these questions, I turned to Kevin McCain, professor of philosophy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and co-author of the book Uncertainty: How It Makes Science Advance."

That means, at least, among a few things, that I\u2019m in fact talking to you right now\u2014but also that I\u2019ve got good evidence for believing that."

Even the things, for the most part, that we take ourselves to be most confident of, most sure of, if we really bear down and think about it, there\u2019s uncertainty there, too. And so what I think is most important is less this sort of search for being absolutely certain, which, if we\u2019re talking about our evidence, we can\u2019t have, and more of aiming for what\u2019s the rational thing to think. And so that is: look to the evidence."

What does that comfort with uncertainty look like when you\u2019re presented with a particular idea like the effectiveness of a vaccine, say?"

That sort of self-correcting is what helps science advance and is what\u2019s allowed it to do so well. [CLIP: Music]"

Scientific knowledge is incremental, and it\u2019s provisional. It\u2019s always subject to new evidence, but we can do a lot with our intermediate understanding. Science is a powerful tool for understanding the complexities underlying the world around us, and it can be incredibly useful for making decisions. The more that we can embrace the uncertainty underlying all science, the better we can become at sitting with that uncertainty and being open to updating our beliefs in light of new evidence. What makes science so powerful is that instead of being dogmatic and rigid, it\u2019s always open to new ideas and new data. As Cris says, let\u2019s embrace the joyful act of finding out! Our show is produced by me, Christie Aschwanden, and Jeff DelViscio. Our series art is by Annaissa Ruiz Tejada. Our music is from Epidemic Sound.
