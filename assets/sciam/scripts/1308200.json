It\u2019s good to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Let\u2019s start with some basic context for our listeners: What was Arecibo, and what anniversary are we talking about today?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"The Arecibo Observatory was formerly the world\u2019s largest radio telescope. And that was until China built their bigger radio telescope more recently, but for many years it had been the largest telescope on Earth, with, with a dish that spans 1,000 feet [305 meters]. And it had a very powerful radar transmitter that they used to study bodies in the solar system, actually."},{"author":"","text":"In 1974 the observatory had just finished doing some upgrades to the facility that were going to turn it into a world-class observatory for astronomy. One of the things they did was they replaced the reflector dish for the telescope and gave it a surface that would let it make observations at frequencies that were really useful for astronomers."},{"author":"","text":"And the other thing they did was that they upgraded the transmitter and gave it more power. And to commemorate that upgrade they decided to have a dedication ceremony and invited about 200, maybe 250 people down to Puerto Rico. And at that ceremony they sent a message into space using the new, very powerful transmitter."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Frank Drake gives a speech on the day of Arecibo transmission: \u201cThe message will take a little less than three minutes to send. When it is finished the first words will already be three quarters the distance to the orbit of Mars.\u201d]"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"And that was on November 16, 1974, so this is the 50th anniversary of that message transmission."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool, and we\u2019re gonna get more into the message itself, but for listeners who don\u2019t know, could you tell us about your personal connection to the message?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"My dad, Frank, is the person who designed the Arecibo message, and he did that with a little help from some folks who were at Cornell University at the time, which is where he was. So his fingerprints are, are all over that design and, and the transmission itself."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, so 50 years ago we sent this message out into space, and your dad was instrumental in crafting it. What did it contain?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"The message contained a lot of information about who we are, as humans, and where we live and the telescope, the facility that actually sent it into space. So in a sense it was basically an interstellar selfie [laughs], right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"Dad sent an image of humans; he drew a kind of cartoony-looking drawing of a human, and he included information about the chemical elements that make us who we are, some of the biomolecules that make us who we are. He had an image of the DNA double helix, which was still a relatively recent discovery in 1974 and I think was on everybody\u2019s minds when they\u2019re thinking about, you know, what it means to be human. And then he included a diagram of the solar system that had Earth kind of bumped up so it would tell anybody who looked at the image which planet we lived on."},{"author":"","text":"So it was just a lot of information about humans, where we are and some of the very basic building blocks that make us human."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. Was this the first message that was, you know, seeking extraterrestrials in, in some sense?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"[Laughs] It\u2019s a really good question. In a sense I think you can definitely say that this is the first time that we sent a message to the stars with the idea being that it could be received by an extraterrestrial civilization."},{"author":"","text":"It is not the first deliberately designed message to leave Earth. Soviet scientists had actually done that a few years before that, using a planetary radar facility in Ukraine. And they had sent words in Russian to the planet Venus, where we don\u2019t think anybody lives. And that message bounced off of Venus and came back to Earth, where it was received by the audience that it was intended for, which was us ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"Humans, yeah."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, more of a demonstration than a serious attempt."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"Yeah, what\u2019s interesting, though, is that Arecibo was also a demonstration of, you know, the new facility\u2019s power, so it\u2019s an interesting parallel between those two situations, I think, that, yeah, demonstrating the capability of a new facility means sending a message into space somehow [chuckles]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and I do think that, you know, what really distinguishes it for a lot of people was how much care was put into creating something that, at least theoretically, could maybe be interpreted by a species that had, you know, completely different language than we did. Could you tell us a little bit about how your dad accomplished that?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"I love that you said it was crafted with care [laughs]. I\u2019m just gonna share that observation."},{"author":"","text":"Yeah, so Dad had this idea to send a message, and he put a lot of thought into what it would say, and he said, ultimately, that he wanted to share information that would be useful for whomever detected it, thinking that maybe they could be made of the same things that we are; they might not be, but either way this would be an interesting scientific result for them."},{"author":"","text":"So he didn\u2019t wanna make the message completely on his own, and he asked for help from some of the staff and the students that he was working with, and he actually did get some help from some of the students. One person who was a graduate student at the time at Cornell University\u2014his name is Richard Isaacman, and he did collaborate with Dad on creating some of the information that\u2019s in the message."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And I think, you know, for some listeners, when they hear about messages sent to the stars, it\u2014it\u2019s hard to wrap their head around, you know, what sort of format this might be in that, you know, makes it at all possible for us to imagine that an alien would be able to encode it. What are we literally talking about? What\u2019s in there?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"I think when you\u2019re considering, \u201cHow do you communicate with someone whose language you don\u2019t speak?\u201d ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"The answer that Dad reached is using images, using art, something that\u2019s representational, that doesn\u2019t require a real understanding of vocabulary or, you know, the language that you\u2019re using."},{"author":"","text":"So he sent an image, and he coded all of the information into that image using a binary code. So it was a string of zeros and ones, literally just 0001010\u2014you know, something like that, where every time there\u2019s a 1 in the code, you would imagine shading in a circle."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"And he sent 1,679\u2014check me on that\u2014bits [laughs], and when you arrange those in a grid of the right dimensions, which is the product of two prime numbers, you get this image. And along the top row it starts with the numbers one through 10 in binary, which is kind of what you need to use to decode some of the information that comes farther down."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you wrote a piece for Scientific American where you recounted surfacing some of your dad\u2019s notes and papers from this time. Could you tell us a little bit about what you learned from those documents and from talking to other folks who were involved in sending the message?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"It was\u2014yes, it was really fun. I was going through some of his files, and we found this original or very early draft of the message, which was done on graph paper\u2014it was just penciled in\u2014and you can see that he\u2019s working through some of the calculations there about how to do the programming. There are notes in the file that show that he\u2019s working out how to represent various elements in the periodic table. And then he\u2019s got some calculations that are\u2014it\u2019s him calculating how long it\u2019s gonna take the message to get to the other planets in the solar system, like Mars, Jupiter\u2014Pluto was still considered a planet then, so it\u2019s in that list."},{"author":"","text":"And what I learned that was probably the most surprising to me is that when I shared an image of that draft on social media, it got a much larger response than I was expecting. It was\u2014so many people immediately knew what it was. They were really excited to see it. And it was a kind of fervency in response that I, I hadn\u2019t been anticipating \u2019cause, you know, growing up with the Arecibo message [laughs], it\u2019s, it\u2019s in our house\u2014it\u2019s a stained-glass window at my mom\u2019s house now, and ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow, yeah."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"I just hadn\u2019t been aware of how much importance it had in [the] collective consciousness of people who are interested in these things."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely. Yeah, well, and, and speaking of that, you know, I think people are so fascinated by the idea of reaching out to extraterrestrial life. How has that search evolved over the last half a century?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"So in, in 1960 Dad did the first scientific search for extraterrestrial civilizations, and he was looking for radio waves that would be distinctly artificial in origin because that is what we use here to communicate. So he was really using us on Earth as a basis for what we think we could expect to see from other civilizations as well."},{"author":"","text":"And since then searches for extraterrestrial technologies\u2014or the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, SETI\u2014I would say has evolved in a way that includes many different kinds of signatures of extraterrestrial technologies. So in addition to looking for radio waves, which we\u2019re still doing, SETI searches are also looking for optical flashes of laser light or the waste heat generated by energy-harvesting megastructures or really any kinds of weirdness in astronomical data that could be there. I would say the search has broadened quite a bit to include not just technologies that are used in communicating but just any detectable technology at all."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and what do you think the future holds for, you know, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"I hope it holds a discovery [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"I really wanna find that signal [laughs]."},{"author":"","text":"I think what\u2019s also really promising right now is that the search for \u201ctechnosignatures,\u201d or, you know, signatures of technology, is really starting to be taken more seriously within the science community. It\u2019s not this kind of\u2014people in the SETI community call it the \u201cgiggle factor\u201d that used to impede progress in SETI, but it seems like that, quote, unquote, \u201cgiggle factor\u201d is fading away, and SETI is starting to be taken seriously as a science."},{"author":"","text":"So that\u2019s really exciting, and that\u2019s an evolution in thought that I think has occurred over, you know, the period of time that I\u2019ve been a science journalist\u2014so really within the last 10 to 15 years we\u2019ve started to see that, which is really exciting."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"You mentioned a really fervent response to some of the, the notes from your dad that you found. What do you think it is about the Arecibo message that really just grips people?"},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"Actually I\u2019m really curious about what you think [laughs]. What\u2019s your idea there?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I mean, I, I love what you said earlier about the message being almost like a, a selfie for the planet, just really sort of trying to encapsulate what we are and sending it out into the galaxy."},{"author":"","text":"You know, I think there\u2019s something so universal about, like, wanting to be seen, and I think when we\u2019re talking about SETI, again, we do really fundamentally want to not be alone and wanna be seen, but there\u2019s something, like, a, a little bit, you know, existentially woozy about it, too. So I, I think it feels so big to think about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and having something so tangible and, and earnest, I think it\u2019s really beautiful. It\u2019s a nice thing to do, even if we don\u2019t necessarily expect it to get us, you know, a selfie and reply, but it would be cool if they did [laughs]."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"Oh, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a beautiful answer. I love \u201cexistentially woozy.\u201d [Laughs]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah, I think, \u2019cause I\u2019m not\u2014it\u2019s not\u2014it shouldn\u2019t be scary, but it is; it\u2019s a very big thing, so [laughs]."},{"author":"Nadia Drake","text":"It\u2019s a very big thing. And, you know, I think there\u2019s a, a little bit of an overlap with some kind of spiritual ideas, too, when you think about SETI and the fact that a lot of people think there might be answers out there: some truths, some ideas about, you know, the, the nature of reality and how we fit into it. And that might fall out of the stars if we find the right beings to communicate with."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Nadia, thank you so much for sharing this with us and for taking the time to chat.

There are notes in the file that show that he\u2019s working out how to represent various elements in the periodic table.

So in addition to looking for radio waves, which we\u2019re still doing, SETI searches are also looking for optical flashes of laser light or the waste heat generated by energy-harvesting megastructures or really any kinds of weirdness in astronomical data that could be there. I would say the search has broadened quite a bit to include not just technologies that are used in communicating but just any detectable technology at all."]},{"begin":"656.880","end":"662.200","lines":["Yeah, and what do you think the future holds for, you know, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?"]},{"begin":"662.200","end":"664.680","lines":["I hope it holds a discovery [laughs]."]},{"begin":"664.680","end":"665.160","lines":["[Laughs]"]},{"begin":"665.160","end":"667.960","lines":["I really wanna find that signal [laughs]."]},{"begin":"667.960","end":"693.400","lines":["I think what\u2019s also really promising right now is that the search for \u201ctechnosignatures,\u201d or, you know, signatures of technology, is really starting to be taken more seriously within the science community.

So I, I think it feels so big to think about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and having something so tangible and, and earnest, I think it\u2019s really beautiful. It\u2019s a nice thing to do, even if we don\u2019t necessarily expect it to get us, you know, a selfie and reply, but it would be cool if they did [laughs]."]},{"begin":"775.120","end":"779.080","lines":["Oh, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a beautiful answer.
