He starts his career in fine dining, and then one day he's trying to find fresh, local snails so he can prepare escargot. But he can't find any, and instead he sort of finds his calling."

You cook the snails in the shell, and you stew them for maybe about an hour with tomato and red wine and lots of onion and garlic. It makes this dish called babbalucci. You get a little messy with it. You eat it with your hands and some toothpicks and some crusty bread. It\u2019s just the best."

      "text": "So what is synthetic mucus, exactly? Well, Adam and his colleagues have found that snail mucus has more than 100 different proteins in it, along with sugars, salts and water. Some of those proteins, called mucins, are responsible for a lot of the magical properties of mucus: the stickiness, the lubrication, and so on. So the idea is to make synthetic snail mucins. In the two years Nomi Materials has been in operation, Adam has raised $0.5 million for the company\u2014and $2 million to study mucus at his CUNY Graduate Center lab. And if you\u2019re wondering who would be interested in all of this, consider that a recent paper from Adam\u2019s lab analyzing snail mucus was funded in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Office of Naval Research."

It took four years for Adam and his colleagues at the CUNY Graduate Center\u2014and later his company\u2014to go from the idea of making synthetic mucin to actually holding a vial full of the stuff. At this point they can produce five grams a month of pure synthetic mucin powder\u2014about the same amount you\u2019d find in 13 gallons of snail mucus because mucus is mostly water. Or, put another way, Adam says five grams of mucin would be enough to pump out at least 130 gallons of snail mucin anti-wrinkle cream. That is indeed where a lot of the money is right now. The snail mucus beauty market is already estimated to be worth more than $1 billion\u2014and counting. Because the moisturizing qualities of mucus are hard to miss ..."

On the spectrum from wonder to disgust, I\u2019d say I was pretty firmly toward the latter\u2014especially based on the many experiences I\u2019ve had wiping stalactites of snot from my toddler\u2019s nose, something she and I both hate. But when I came across Antonio\u2019s work and found out he had a whole library of mucus and was pretty much obsessed with the stuff\u2014well, I was intrigued. And learning about how essential mucus is not just for our own health but for the functioning of literally every animal on Earth, how could I not become sort of obsessed with it, too? Mucus truly is magical. And I hope you now think so, too. Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Rachel Feltman and Kelso Harper and edited by Madison Goldberg, Elah Feder and Alexa Lim.
