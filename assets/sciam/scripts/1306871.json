Yes, I think it\u2019s funny, but it also conjures up this image of a snail ranch."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Do you have a lasso or something?"},{"author":"Knapp","text":"Very tiny lassos\u2014dental floss. Yeah. Yeah."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Really?"},{"author":"Knapp","text":"No, no, no, no, not really. No, no, no lassos."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"[laughs] I was like, \u201cThis job\u2019s getting weirder than I thought.\u201d"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"This is Christopher Intagliata, and you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly. Today I\u2019m taking you on the final leg of our three-part Fascination on slime. We\u2019re gonna start at a snail farm and end up in space. So back to Taylor, the snail wrangler. He starts his career in fine dining, and then one day he's trying to find fresh, local snails so he can prepare escargot. But he can't find any, and instead he sort of finds his calling."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"The initial idea was very kind of silly. I just noticed that there were no snail farms in the U.S.... I knew that the best restaurants in America had snails on their menu, which means that they were using canned snails."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Taylor thinks, \u2018That\u2019s absurd.\u2019 So he starts his own snail farm. And today he raises 70,000 snails at a time, which means he\u2019s gotten really fast at snail shucking."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"I can do, I\u2019m thinking, about 600 in a half an hour."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That is one snail every three seconds. And nowadays Taylor has all the fresh snails he\u2019d ever care to cook."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"We\u2019ve done snail tacos and snail and mushroom tarts and ramen and all of these things. There\u2019s one preparation that\u2019s by far my favorite, and it\u2019s an old Sicilian recipe. You cook the snails in the shell, and you stew them for maybe about an hour with tomato and red wine and lots of onion and garlic. It makes this dish called babbalucci. You get a little messy with it. You eat it with your hands and some toothpicks and some crusty bread. It\u2019s just the best."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"I mean, count me in on that. And Taylor isn\u2019t the only one cooking these snails. He says he\u2019s supplied snails to the best restaurants in the country: Daniel, the French Laundry, Eleven Madison Park. But five years ago he gets a phone call from this guy named Antonio Cerullo."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"So anyway, he reached out, and I just thought his, his study that he was working on was really interesting."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The study involved searching far and wide across the animal kingdom for mucus samples\u2014because, Antonio says ..."},{"author":"Antonio Cerullo: ","text":"With every mucus sample that we can acquire and research, our global understanding of mucus becomes stronger."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"You might remember the researcher with a mucus library from the first episode. Antonio is that same slime guy."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"And so, getting to talk with him, he started to explain what he was after."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"A single species of snail will produce three different mucus."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"And it was just very fascinating. I mean, it was a whole, I mean, a lot of things I\u2019ve never even thought about."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"Every animal on the planet uses mucus for so many important things."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"So I\u2019d be in there, doing my thing, and I just gave him a pen of snails, and I said, \u201cHere you go. Go to town.\u201d"},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"So for the protective mucus, that, we just simply scrape off the back with a little spatula."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"I don\u2019t know a whole lot about what he was doing. I mean, there were snails moving on glass plates."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"We just put out a fleet of petri dishes and just let them crawl all over the place, just leaving their slime everywhere."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"And I know they were scraping the mucus off of those glass plates."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"And then for the adhesive, we use, take one of those dishes, flip it upside down and just attach the snail to it.... And then we just let it hang for a while."},{"author":"Intagliata: \u201c","text":"We just let it hang for a while.\u201d Anyway, Antonio gets all these mucus samples and takes them back to his lab, then at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and he finds that the sticky slime, the lubricating slime and the protective slime\u2014they all have different chemical recipes."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"And the differences in the composition actually correlate with differences in measurable mechanical properties ..."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Meaning the slime recipe dictates its function. And all these variations of slime could be useful for all sorts of commercial products:adhesives and lubricants and coatings\u2014beauty products, too. The problem is that you'd be relying on snails for the raw materials\u2014 which throws a lot of variables at your mucus recipe."},{"author":"Adam Braunschweig: ","text":"[It] depends on what the snail ate, it depends on the weather. Is the snail sick? [Are there] contaminants?"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"This is Adam Braunschweig of the CUNY Graduate Center and Hunter College. He was Antonio\u2019s Ph.D. adviser\u2014and he\u2019s a chemist."},{"author":"Braunschweig","text":"I don\u2019t think anybody has any idea what a chemist does, so it\u2019s a little vague and a little mysterious."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Adam says there are all sorts of disadvantages to commercializing mucus from animals: There are ethical issues. There are production issues\u2014maybe you find a rare snail that makes some really interesting mucus, but it\u2019s impossible to farm. And there are purity issues\u2014maybe you just don\u2019t want all that other gunk snails put in their mucus ..."},{"author":"Braunschweig","text":"All the proteins, all the sugars, some of the venoms that are in there."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So his solution? [CLIP: \u201cLightning Strikes,\u201d by Klaus Nomi]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"He co-foundeda synthetic mucus company called Nomi Materials, after Klaus Nomi, the German operatic singer with the look of a tuxedoed alien. Adam says naming the company after the singer was his way of paying tribute to what he calls the \u201clost generation\u201d of artists, like Nomi, who were early victims of the AIDS crisis. [CLIP: \u201cLightning Strikes,\u201d by Klaus Nomi]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So what is synthetic mucus, exactly? Well, Adam and his colleagues have found that snail mucus has more than 100 different proteins in it, along with sugars, salts and water. Some of those proteins, called mucins, are responsible for a lot of the magical properties of mucus: the stickiness, the lubrication, and so on. So the idea is to make synthetic snail mucins. In the two years Nomi Materials has been in operation, Adam has raised $0.5 million for the company\u2014and $2 million to study mucus at his CUNY Graduate Center lab."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And if you\u2019re wondering who would be interested in all of this, consider that a recent paper from Adam\u2019s lab analyzing snail mucus was funded in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Office of Naval Research."},{"author":"Braunschweig","text":"The military, they work with adhesives, they work with lubricants, they work with coatings. These are all the purposes of mucus in the natural world, and in many cases the behavior of the mucus is superior."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So sub in synthetic mucins, Adam says, and you might end up with a better-performing product that\u2019s also more sustainable. And the implications go further than that\u2014all the way to spaceflight."},{"author":"Braunschweig","text":"So one of the problems with the helmet dome of space suits is: they fog up."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That\u2019s something you can relate to if you\u2019ve ever been snorkeling or scuba diving: Have you ever tried spitting into your mask to keep it from fogging up? Well, there\u2019s mucus in spit, and mucus absorbs water and prevents fogging. So Adam and his colleagues are playing around with synthetic mucins as a coating for the helmet dome of space suits."},{"author":"Braunschweig","text":"There needs to be a special coating on that dome to prevent fogging but that also can handle the extreme environments of space. Many times these have very designer protective coatings. But NASA has designated that they still are searching for better solutions."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"But it\u2019s still early days for synthetic mucus. It took four years for Adam and his colleagues at the CUNY Graduate Center\u2014and later his company\u2014to go from the idea of making synthetic mucin to actually holding a vial full of the stuff. At this point they can produce five grams a month of pure synthetic mucin powder\u2014about the same amount you\u2019d find in 13 gallons of snail mucus because mucus is mostly water. Or, put another way, Adam says five grams of mucin would be enough to pump out at least 130 gallons of snail mucin anti-wrinkle cream."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That is indeed where a lot of the money is right now. The snail mucus beauty market is already estimated to be worth more than $1 billion\u2014and counting. Because the moisturizing qualities of mucus are hard to miss ..."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"I think we have very soft hands.... I don\u2019t know. [laughs]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That\u2019s snail shucker Taylor Knapp again."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"They get, they get mucusy. And that\u2019s such an interesting angle that I have because I\u2019m almost trying to eliminate mucus. You know, we can\u2019t ... be giving these chefs a big, slimy, mass of, you know ... In the culinary world, mucus is typically not something you\u2019re going for."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And yet\u2014and yet\u2014Taylor says that after working with Antonio, he has been awakened to the beauty of mucus."},{"author":"Knapp","text":"Yes, I have grown a deeper appreciation for the world of mucus and everything, you know, all of its potentials. Yeah."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And I have, too! I\u2019ll admit, I hadn\u2019t really given a second thought to mucus before embarking on this story. On the spectrum from wonder to disgust, I\u2019d say I was pretty firmly toward the latter\u2014especially based on the many experiences I\u2019ve had wiping stalactites of snot from my toddler\u2019s nose, something she and I both hate. But when I came across Antonio\u2019s work and found out he had a whole library of mucus and was pretty much obsessed with the stuff\u2014well, I was intrigued."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And learning about how essential mucus is not just for our own health but for the functioning of literally every animal on Earth, how could I not become sort of obsessed with it, too? Mucus truly is magical. And I hope you now think so, too. Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Rachel Feltman and Kelso Harper and edited by Madison Goldberg, Elah Feder and Alexa Lim.
