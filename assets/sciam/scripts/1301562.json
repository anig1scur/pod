When in the back of the brain, they said their mind was a blank, and they failed to respond at all. Andrillon says that makes sense, given what we know about what different parts of the brain do for us."]},{"begin":"259.240","end":"271.400","lines":["Frontal regions are indeed heavily involved in communicative control and the regulation of impulsivity, whereas posterior regions encode and integrate sensory information, enabling us to react to our environment."]},{"begin":"271.400","end":"294.760","lines":["The researchers are currently exploring whether these slow waves can be harnessed to promote creative thinking, which might someday lead to big rewards for sleeping on the job.
