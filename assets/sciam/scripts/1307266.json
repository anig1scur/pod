But scientific detective work has finally pinpointed the worst culprit: human urine. When household septic systems flush nitrogen and other nutrients into the water, they provide an all-you-can-eat buffet for algae blooms. More algae means less sunlight and oxygen for other marine life, which means trouble for the people of Cape Cod. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today we\u2019re bringing you the second installment in our three-part Fascination series on Cape Cod\u2019s yellow tide."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman","text":"In this episode WBUR environmental correspondent Barbara Moran looks at some of the big-ticket pollution solutions up for consideration\u2014and unpacks why they\u2019re so controversial. So without further ado, here\u2019s part two: \u201cSticker Shock.\u201d [CLIP: Gerard Martin speaks at a Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) hearing: \u201cAll right, excuse me, everybody, I think we\u2019re gonna get going.\u201d]"},{"author":"Barbara Moran","text":"Starting in late 2022 and continuing into the next year, concerned residents gathered for a series of public meetings with representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. The residents were there to share their thoughts. [CLIP: Martin continues to speak at the hearing: \u201cThe hearing is being recorded and conducted in a hybrid format.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"The state was proposing new rules that would require communities to reduce their nitrogen pollution. In some places that meant people would potentially have to install new $35,000 septic systems. Here\u2019s what Frank King of Brewster, Massachusetts, had to say about that. [CLIP: Frank King speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cIf that is correct, you are looking at a massive protest on the scale of another Boston Tea Party.\u201d] [CLIP: Chris Shanahan speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cThirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year? That\u2019s a complete misrepresentation.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"That\u2019s Chris Shanahan of Falmouth, Massachusetts. [CLIP: Shanahan continues to speak at the hearing: \u201cYou can buy a system for that. You gotta maintain it. You gotta fix parts. It just never ends. So lifetime expense is more like eighty or a hundred thousand over 30 years.\u201d] [CLIP: Joan Hutchings speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that has a McMansion. I\u2019ve got a three-bedroom home that\u2019s been in my family for a bazillion years.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Joan Hutchings of North Truro, Massachusetts. She said her town already made her upgrade her septic system. [CLIP: Hutchings continues to speak at the hearing: \u201cNow the state\u2019s gonna have me do something else? I don\u2019t know, I might put an outhouse out back\u2014seriously.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"People are concerned about the cost, as you heard. But they\u2019re also concerned about whether these new systems even work. Can they actually prevent water pollution? I wondered the same thing. So I went to see an expert."},{"author":"Brian Baumgaertel","text":"My name is Brian Baumgaertel. I\u2019m the director of the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center."},{"author":"Moran","text":"You met Brian briefly in Episode One. Now we\u2019re on his home turf: a two-and-a-half acre outdoor laboratory on Cape Cod known as MASSTC. Brian\u2019s team is on a mission to find the best septic systems in the world\u2014and it\u2019s not a job for the squeamish. [CLIP: Sound of wastewater channel]"},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"All right, so I\u2019m looking into this hole, and there\u2019s, like, water pouring in and some scummy stuff floating around there."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s the raw wastewater coming in from Joint Base Cape Cod. And it doesn\u2019t look like what most people would think of when\u2014you know, when you\u2019re thinking of wastewater, you think it\u2019s pretty disgusting. I\u2014you know, maybe I\u2019ve just gotten so used to it. I don\u2019t know."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It is a little disgusting. [Laughs]"},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"It\u2019s got kind of a smell. You know, it\u2019s one of the less glorious parts of MASSTC, but it\u2019s a necessity. [Laughs] It\u2019s brown gold, brown gold for us."},{"author":"Moran","text":"MASSTC uses that brown gold to test prototype septic systems from all over the world. I ask Brian to show me one\u2014although it\u2019s hard to see much at the facility."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"A lot of what we do here is underground because of course, for the most part, septic systems in homes would be underground."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Brian walks over to a grassy mound that looks weirdly like a burial site\u2014which it is, actually. He says that buried underneath our feet is a new kind of septic system that removes nitrogen from wastewater. Here\u2019s how it works: Wastewater flows into a tank, and all the solid stuff sinks to the bottom. The liquid left floating on top includes our pee, which is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients. This liquid flows out of the tank \u2026"},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"And then flows into the actual unit itself \u2026"},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Another tank that\u2019s under our feet."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"Yep, yep. There\u2019s another tank that\u2019s about 12 feet long right here."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"And inside that tank are a number of compartments."},{"author":"Moran","text":"The compartments contain limestone rocks and wood chips. These ingredients create a breeding ground for bacteria that eat nitrogen. They convert it into harmless nitrogen gas before it gets into the groundwater. Other systems remove nitrogen in different ways. Brian and his team test the water coming out of each system to see how well it works. And he says this one has been working pretty well."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"So far the data look very encouraging. Every day we get a little bit more data, we get a little bit more confidence that the technology can work. [CLIP: \u201cWe Are Giants,\u201d by Silver Maple]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Others are also heartened by the data, including Zenas Crocker, who goes by Zee. He\u2019s executive director of the nonprofit Barnstable Clean Water Coalition."},{"author":"Zenas Crocker","text":"And this system is so successful that in the data that we\u2019re seeing now, it will remove between 95 and 97 percent of nitrogen going into the groundwater."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Zee\u2019s group was so impressed with how well these systems remove nitrogen that it launched a pilot project. The group is installing more than a dozen in a neighborhood by Shubael Pond in Barnstable, Massachusetts\u2014including one when I visited last September. [CLIP: Sound of chains being attached to a tank, followed by it being lifted]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"As we watch, a crane operator uses chains to lift a concrete tank and lower it into a hole in the ground. [CLIP: Sound of the tank being lowered and men talking]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Zee\u2019s group is working with the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey to monitor how well the new systems keep nitrogen out of the groundwater."},{"author":"Crocker","text":"We chose this location in particular because these are all small lots. We\u2019re also in a working-class community. Generally we\u2019re looking at full-time residents here and people who really can\u2019t afford, necessarily, to upgrade their septic systems."},{"author":"Moran","text":"The Barnstable Clean Water Coalition paid to install the systems in this neighborhood; the homeowners paid nothing\u2014which won\u2019t be an option for the whole cape. But there is another approach to stopping wastewater pollution: switching from septic tanks to sewage pipes, which would bring the waste to a treatment plant. And that\u2019s what Barnstable is doing in other parts of the town. I went to Barnstable\u2019s town hall to meet the guy in charge."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Hi, how\u2019re you doing? I have a nine o\u2019clock interview with Mark Ells."},{"author":"Receptionist","text":"Okay, sure, he\u2019ll be right with you."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Mark Ells is Barnstable\u2019s town manager."},{"author":"Mark Ells","text":"We\u2019ve seen a significant deterioration of our bays to the point where we don\u2019t have shellfish, we don\u2019t have finfish. So we want to make sure that we put in place solutions that help us to address not only what we know today but what we\u2019re anticipating tomorrow."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Barnstable is the largest town on the cape, and parts are pretty urban, with houses and commercial buildings relatively close together. In places like this, sewer systems are a practical and cost-effective choice. So the town has begun a massive expansion of its sewer system, planning to extend service to almost 12,000 properties. [CLIP: \u201cLet There Be Rain,\u201d by Silver Maple] It\u2019ll take 30 years and cost more than $1 billion. The town got local, state and federal funding to help cover the expansion costs. But homeowners will still have to pay."},{"author":"Moran","text":"First there\u2019s a town assessment of up to $10,000. Then homeowners have to pay to get their house hooked up to the sewer line and pay for someone to deal with their old septic tank. And then they\u2019ll have a monthly sewer bill. The final cost, spread over decades, is probably in the range of $20,000 to $30,000\u2014or more\u2014per house. [CLIP: Construction sounds]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"And there\u2019s another cost to installing sewer lines: seemingly constant roadwork and traffic jams. One day last fall cars crawled along as superintendent Mike Donovan\u2019s crew dug up the main road into Barnstable."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Is this going to be, like, what your company does for, like, the next three decades?"},{"author":"Mike Donovan","text":"We\u2014well, hopefully, yeah. That\u2019s what we do for a living. We\u2019re installing sewer all over the cape right now."},{"author":"Moran","text":"But even this ambitious, expensive sewer expansion will take decades to reach some neighborhoods in Barnstable. Pat Uhlman lives across the street from Shubael Pond. And she\u2019s seen it turn green with toxic algae. She says a few decades is too long to keep polluting the water."},{"author":"Pat Uhlman","text":"If we don\u2019t start cleaning it up now, you know, you might not even want to walk down by that pond by then."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Luckily Pat is part of the neighborhood pilot project that got new septic systems installed for free. She says she understands that other homeowners are feeling sticker shock, but the pollution has to stop."},{"author":"Uhlman","text":"The cape economy is still people coming here in the summer. So if they can\u2019t swim in our ponds, they can\u2019t swim in our ocean, they can\u2019t boat, there\u2019s not gonna be any reason for them to come here. [CLIP: Theme music]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"There may be another solution, a cheaper one. It won\u2019t solve all the cape\u2019s water problems, but it could help\u2014a lot. We\u2019ll talk about that next week in the final part of this Scientific American\u2013WBUR Fascination miniseries."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thanks for listening.
