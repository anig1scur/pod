      "text": ": Cape Cod\u2019s ponds and bays have suffered from decades of pollution. But scientific detective work has finally pinpointed the worst culprit: human urine. When household septic systems flush nitrogen and other nutrients into the water, they provide an all-you-can-eat buffet for algae blooms. More algae means less sunlight and oxygen for other marine life, which means trouble for the people of Cape Cod. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today we\u2019re bringing you the second installment in our three-part Fascination series on Cape Cod\u2019s yellow tide. In this episode WBUR environmental correspondent Barbara Moran looks at some of the big-ticket pollution solutions up for consideration\u2014and unpacks why they\u2019re so controversial. So without further ado, here\u2019s part two: \u201cSticker Shock.\u201d [CLIP: Gerard Martin speaks at a Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) hearing: \u201cAll right, excuse me, everybody, I think we\u2019re gonna get going.\u201d]"

In some places that meant people would potentially have to install new $35,000 septic systems. Here\u2019s what Frank King of Brewster, Massachusetts, had to say about that. [CLIP: Frank King speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cIf that is correct, you are looking at a massive protest on the scale of another Boston Tea Party.\u201d] [CLIP: Chris Shanahan speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cThirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year? That\u2019s a complete misrepresentation.\u201d]"

You gotta fix parts. It just never ends. So lifetime expense is more like eighty or a hundred thousand over 30 years.\u201d] [CLIP: Joan Hutchings speaks at the MassDEP hearing: \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that has a McMansion.

He says that buried underneath our feet is a new kind of septic system that removes nitrogen from wastewater. Here\u2019s how it works: Wastewater flows into a tank, and all the solid stuff sinks to the bottom. The liquid left floating on top includes our pee, which is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients. This liquid flows out of the tank \u2026"

They convert it into harmless nitrogen gas before it gets into the groundwater. Other systems remove nitrogen in different ways.

In places like this, sewer systems are a practical and cost-effective choice. So the town has begun a massive expansion of its sewer system, planning to extend service to almost 12,000 properties. [CLIP: \u201cLet There Be Rain,\u201d by Silver Maple] It\u2019ll take 30 years and cost more than $1 billion. The town got local, state and federal funding to help cover the expansion costs. But homeowners will still have to pay. First there\u2019s a town assessment of up to $10,000. Then homeowners have to pay to get their house hooked up to the sewer line and pay for someone to deal with their old septic tank. And then they\u2019ll have a monthly sewer bill. The final cost, spread over decades, is probably in the range of $20,000 to $30,000\u2014or more\u2014per house. [CLIP: Construction sounds]"
