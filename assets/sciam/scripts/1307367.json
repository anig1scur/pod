Stay out of the ocean while you\u2019re healing so you don\u2019t pick up a smidgen of flesh-eating bacteria. Gently wash your new ink with soap and water, avoid sun exposure and frequently apply an unscented moisturizer\u2014easy-peasy. But body art enthusiasts might face potential risks from a source they don\u2019t expect: tattoo inks themselves. Up until relatively recently tattoo inks in the U.S."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman: ","text":"were totally unregulated. In 2022 the federal government pulled tattoo inks under the regulatory umbrella of cosmetics, which means the Food and Drug Administration can oversee these products. But now researchers are finding that many commercial inks contain ingredients they\u2019re not supposed to. Some of these additives are simply compounds that should be listed on the packaging and aren\u2019t. But others could pose a risk to consumers. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. I\u2019m joined today by John Swierk, an assistant professor of chemistry at Binghamton University, State University of New York."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman: ","text":"His team is trying to figure out exactly what goes into each vial of tattoo ink\u2014and how tattoos actually work in the first place\u2014to help make body art safer, longer-lasting and maybe even cooler. John, thank you so much for being here. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit about your research background. How did it bring you to tattoos and tattooing?"},{"author":"John Swierk: ","text":"So I\u2019m a photochemist by training, which means I think about how light interacts with molecules and can drive chemistry. And one of the areas we got really interested in was trying to understand why light causes tattoos to fade. This is a huge question when you think about something with laser tattoo removal, where you\u2019re talking about an industry on the scale of $1 billion a year. And it turns out we really don\u2019t understand that process."},{"author":"John Swierk: ","text":"And so starting to look at how the tattoo pigments change when you expose them to light, what that might be doing in the skin, then led us to a lot of other questions about tattoos that we realized weren\u2019t well understood\u2014even something as simple as what\u2019s actually in tattoo ink."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"As someone with tattoos, the question of how they react to sunlight is, of course, a really practical concern in terms of caring for tattoos long term. But yeah, it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me that even the laser removal industry doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on there. That's so fascinating. So tattoo ink, What are some of the big issues your lab is concerned with?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"As we were doing a lot of our work, trying to understand something about the interaction of light and tattoos, we started noticing a lot of things in the ink that weren\u2019t listed as being component in its makeup."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"And so recently we\u2019ve been looking at commercial tattoo inks and sort of surprised to find that in the overwhelming majority of them, we\u2019re seeing things that are not listed as part of the ingredients....Now that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the things that are in these inks are unsafe, but it does cause a huge problem if you want to try to understand something about the safety of tattoos. Some of the things we found can be pretty significant allergens for some people."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"So it, it creates this environment where it\u2019s really hard to figure out what\u2019s going on in the body because we don\u2019t actually know what we\u2019re putting into the body."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I was actually, just last night, getting my first tattoo in several years, and without me mentioning my anticipated conversation with you, one of the artists there was talking to her client about, you know, the sort of routine versus not so routine skin reactions people get from tattoos. And she was saying, \u201cOh, I tend to have a problem with white inks but not all white inks, so I don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s about.\u201d And my artist was ...very passionate about ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"people needing to take this more seriously\u2014you know, the hunt for reputable companies and hoping that those companies have some understanding of what\u2019s in their inks. What kind of feedback do you tend to get from people in the industry when they hear about your work?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"It\u2019s really changed over the last couple of years. Before Congress passed the sort of updated regulations that obligated tattoo inks to be sort of examined and regulated by the FDA, I'd go into a room and I\u2019d get a very mixed reaction, right? Some people would be very supportive; some people will be somewhat hostile, right, worried that we\u2019re going to be doing something that might cause the industry to get into trouble."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"After the change in regulations, though, it\u2019s sort of been night and day because part of what the FDA is looking for are scientifically peer-reviewed studies that talk about safety, that talk about something as simple as \u201cWhat is a tattoo? Is it an injection? Is [it] something else....?\u201d Now, when I\u2019m talking to a room of people, it\u2019s much more often to\u2014\u201cWhat can you tell us? How can you help us?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"FDA is asking for this, and we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d And one of the things that has been really important to the team and I from day one is that we really want to be collaborative with the tattoo industry, right? We\u2019re not anti-tattoo. We\u2019re not out to try to get tattooing banned or anything like that. And a lot of what motivates us is trying to support artists and their clients so that we can get the best outcomes for everybody."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"And so a lot of our work at looking at tattoo inks is kind of driven by this idea that we, as chemists, have access to really powerful tools that your typical artist would not have access to and that even some of the manufacturers don\u2019t have access to. And we\u2019re always happy to talk to artists."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"We love that we have some good friends that are artists in the industry, and we find that there\u2019s such a rich, unbelievable wealth of knowledge that longtime tattooers have that\u2019s really important and useful and often not understood in the scientific literature...which has really helped us in our research."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and I think what\u2019s really exciting is that, you know, obviously, I think most people would agree that it would be great to know that tattoo inks are safe [and] being made safely, you know? And of course, that\u2019s not unique to tattoo inks; cosmetics and supplements have a lot of similar problems that we need to work on. But, if we\u2019re going to get a better grasp on the chemistry and even the immunology of tattoos, that\u2019s not just going to help us make them safer but, you know, potentially improve healing, appearance, longevity."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I mean, I think about that start-up that promised \u201cephemeral tattoos\u201d that now folks a few years later are coming out and saying, \u201cThese tattoos have not gone away,\u201d and thinking about how much potential there is for genuine innovation if we can start to answer some of these questions."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"One hundred percent agree, and that\u2019s often one of the things that I will tell people in the industry: that if we understand the science of tattoos better, right...we can start to think about designing new pigments that might have better colorfastness, less reactivity, less sort of bleeding of the lines, right, over time. But all of those things can only happen if we actually understand tattoos, and we really just don\u2019t understand them that well at the moment."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure\u2014well, and that\u2019s a great segue into talking about your latest study. What did you find?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"So our latest work was really focused on looking at commercial tattoo inks in the U.S. We looked at 54 inks, and of the 54, 45 had what we consider to be major discrepancies\u2014so these were either unlisted pigments, unlisted additives. And that was really concerning to us, right? You\u2019re talking about inks coming from major, global, industry-leading manufacturers all the way down to smaller, more niche inks\u2014that there were problems across the board. So we found things like incorrect pigments being listed."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"We found issues of some major allergens being used\u2014these aren\u2019t necessarily compounds that are specifically toxic, but to some people they can generate a really pronounced allergic response. And a couple of things: we found an antibiotic that\u2019s most commonly used for urinary tract infections. We found a preservative that the FDA has cautioned nursing mothers against, you know, having exposure to\u2014so things that at a minimum, need to be disclosed so that consumers could make informed choices."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. And so on that note, you know, given how much we don\u2019t know about tattoos...when people ask you...\u201cSo what should I do?\u201d What\u2019s your advice on, like, the responsible way to get a tattoo\u2014if that exists?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"So I think the number-one thing is that we know for sure that working with an unskilled artist who\u2019s not following good hygiene or that the client isn\u2019t following proper aftercare procedures...we know that that is going to cause a problem. And so if somebody\u2019s thinking about getting a tattoo, they should be working with an artist who is experienced, who has apprenticed under experienced artists, who is really following best practices in terms of sanitation, aftercare, things like that. That\u2019s where we know you can have a problem."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"Beyond that, I think it\u2019s a matter of how comfortable you are with some degree of risk. The point I always really want to emphasize is that, you know, our work isn\u2019t saying anything about whether tattoos are safe or not. It\u2019s the first step in that process. Just because we found some stuff in the inks doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t get a tattoo or that you have a new risk for skin cancer or something like that...."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"it's that this is the process of how science grows, right\u2014that we have to start understanding the basics and the fundamentals so that we can build the next questions on top of that. And our understanding of tattoos in the body is still at such an early level that we don\u2019t really even understand what the risk factors would be, \u201cWhat should we be looking for?\u201d So I think it\u2019s like with anything in life: if you\u2019re comfortable with a degree of risk, then, yeah, go ahead and get the tattoo."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"People get tattoos for lots of reasons that are important and meaningful and very impactful in a positive way in their life. And I think a concern over a hypothetical risk is probably not worth the potential positives of getting a tattoo. We know that light exposure\u2014 particularly the sunlight\u2014is not great for the tattoo, and if we have concerns about long-term pigment breakdown, ultraviolet light is probably going to enhance that, so keeping your tattoo covered, using sunscreen when you can\u2019t keep it covered\u2014that\u2019s probably very important."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"If you\u2019re really concerned about the risk, we can think about the size of the tattoo. So somebody with a relatively small piece of line art on their back is in a very different potential risk category than somebody who is fully sleeved and, you know, covered from, say, neck to ankle in tattoos."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"And again we\u2019re not saying that either those people have a significant risk that they need to be worried about, but if somebody is concerned, the person with the small line art on the back is much less likely to have to worry about the risk than somebody with a huge tattoo. We also know that certain colors, like yellow in particular, fade much more readily. That suggests that those pigments are interacting with the body a lot more."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"Staying away from bright colors and focusing on black inks might be a more prudent option there, but again, right, a lot of these are hypothetical and we don\u2019t want to alarm people or scare them. All we can point to is, you know, \u201cThis is what we don\u2019t understand, and as long as you\u2019re comfortable with that, you know, go find a great artist, follow their instructions, and, you know, be happy with your tattoo.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s great advice. And I think I saw somewhere that you don\u2019t personally have any tattoos, and I\u2019m curious: Has this research made you any more or less likely to get one or, you know, changed how you think about tattoos beyond the chemistry at all?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"Well, working in this space without tattoos has created a really unique problem for me, which is: I now have a lot of friends that tattoo."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"And so it sort of feels like if I was going to get one tattoo, I have to commit to getting, like, 10 all at once."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"You know,there\u2019s also some practical concerns of, you know, if we get a tattoo, and I say...\u201cThe artist is using this specific ink,\u201d am I unintentionally endorsing that this is the right ink...? So there are some complications there. But, you know, I have nothing against tattoos.... It\u2019s really not a\u2014an issue of I\u2019m uncomfortable with the safety around them or something like that. It\u2019s just purely a\u2014you know, I didn\u2019t get them when I was in my 20s, and now, you know, I have a cadre of artists circling with their ..."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"their machines, ready to go to work on me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Totally reasonable. What are you working on next?"},{"author":"Swierk","text":"So we\u2019re in a few different areas. We\u2019re still looking at what\u2019s in tattoo inks. We\u2019re also still working on understanding what tattoo pigments break down into. We really don\u2019t understand a lot about laser tattoo removal, and if there is some aspect of tattooing that gives me pause, it\u2019s probably that part. It's a very reasonable concern, I think, that you may have pigments that are entirely safe in the skin, but once you start zapping them with high-powered lasers, we don\u2019t know what you do to the chemistry, and so that could change the dynamic a lot."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"And so we\u2019re trying to figure out how to do that and, I think, making some progress there. And then the last area\u2014which is, is new to us but kind of fun\u2014is actually just looking at the biomechanics of tattooing."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"You would think that we\u2019d really understand how the ink goes into the skin, how it stays in the skin, but the picture there is a little bit hazy, and that really goes to, again, if you\u2019re thinking about \u201cCould you make functional tattoos, or could you just make tattooing better and easier?\u201d And those are sort of important questions to answer. One of the interesting things, when you talk to ink manufacturers and artists, is that they sort of have this intuitive feel for ..."},{"author":"Swierk","text":"sort of what the viscosity of the ink should be like and how much pigment is in there but can\u2019t necessarily articulate why a particular viscosity is good or why a particular pigment loading is good. And so we think if we understand something about the process by which the ink goes...and so we think understanding the biomechanics could really open some interesting possibilities and lead to better, more interesting tattoos down the road as well."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I hope that made you as excited about the future of tattoo science as it made me.

And so on that note, you know, given how much we don\u2019t know about tattoos...when people ask you...\u201cSo what should I do?\u201d What\u2019s your advice on, like, the responsible way to get a tattoo\u2014if that exists?"]},{"begin":"626.240","end":"662.440","lines":["So I think the number-one thing is that we know for sure that working with an unskilled artist who\u2019s not following good hygiene or that the client isn\u2019t following proper aftercare procedures...we know that that is going to cause a problem. And so if somebody\u2019s thinking about getting a tattoo, they should be working with an artist who is experienced, who has apprenticed under experienced artists, who is really following best practices in terms of sanitation, aftercare, things like that. That\u2019s where we know you can have a problem."]},{"begin":"662.440","end":"688.760","lines":["Beyond that, I think it\u2019s a matter of how comfortable you are with some degree of risk. The point I always really want to emphasize is that, you know, our work isn\u2019t saying anything about whether tattoos are safe or not. It\u2019s the first step in that process. Just because we found some stuff in the inks doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t get a tattoo or that you have a new risk for skin cancer or something like that...."]},{"begin":"688.760","end":"722.400","lines":["it's that this is the process of how science grows, right\u2014that we have to start understanding the basics and the fundamentals so that we can build the next questions on top of that. And our understanding of tattoos in the body is still at such an early level that we don\u2019t really even understand what the risk factors would be, \u201cWhat should we be looking for?\u201d So I think it\u2019s like with anything in life: if you\u2019re comfortable with a degree of risk, then, yeah, go ahead and get the tattoo."]},{"begin":"722.400","end":"759.200","lines":["People get tattoos for lots of reasons that are important and meaningful and very impactful in a positive way in their life. And I think a concern over a hypothetical risk is probably not worth the potential positives of getting a tattoo. We know that light exposure\u2014 particularly the sunlight\u2014is not great for the tattoo, and if we have concerns about long-term pigment breakdown, ultraviolet light is probably going to enhance that, so keeping your tattoo covered, using sunscreen when you can\u2019t keep it covered\u2014that\u2019s probably very important."]},{"begin":"759.200","end":"779.200","lines":["If you\u2019re really concerned about the risk, we can think about the size of the tattoo. So somebody with a relatively small piece of line art on their back is in a very different potential risk category than somebody who is fully sleeved and, you know, covered from, say, neck to ankle in tattoos."]},{"begin":"779.200","end":"808.880","lines":["And again we\u2019re not saying that either those people have a significant risk that they need to be worried about, but if somebody is concerned, the person with the small line art on the back is much less likely to have to worry about the risk than somebody with a huge tattoo. We also know that certain colors, like yellow in particular, fade much more readily. That suggests that those pigments are interacting with the body a lot more."]},{"begin":"808.880","end":"833.160","lines":["Staying away from bright colors and focusing on black inks might be a more prudent option there, but again, right, a lot of these are hypothetical and we don\u2019t want to alarm people or scare them. All we can point to is, you know, \u201cThis is what we don\u2019t understand, and as long as you\u2019re comfortable with that, you know, go find a great artist, follow their instructions, and, you know, be happy with your tattoo.\u201d"]},{"begin":"833.160","end":"850.800","lines":["Yeah, that\u2019s great advice. And I think I saw somewhere that you don\u2019t personally have any tattoos, and I\u2019m curious: Has this research made you any more or less likely to get one or, you know, changed how you think about tattoos beyond the chemistry at all?"]},{"begin":"850.800","end":"859.920","lines":["Well, working in this space without tattoos has created a really unique problem for me, which is: I now have a lot of friends that tattoo."]},{"begin":"859.920","end":"861.320","lines":["Sure, yeah."]},{"begin":"861.320","end":"869.000","lines":["And so it sort of feels like if I was going to get one tattoo, I have to commit to getting, like, 10 all at once."]},{"begin":"869.000","end":"869.560","lines":["[Laughs]"]},{"begin":"869.560","end":"902.200","lines":["You know,there\u2019s also some practical concerns of, you know, if we get a tattoo, and I say...\u201cThe artist is using this specific ink,\u201d am I unintentionally endorsing that this is the right ink...? So there are some complications there. But, you know, I have nothing against tattoos.... It\u2019s really not a\u2014an issue of I\u2019m uncomfortable with the safety around them or something like that.

What are you working on next?"]},{"begin":"908.200","end":"943.000","lines":["So we\u2019re in a few different areas. We\u2019re still looking at what\u2019s in tattoo inks. We\u2019re also still working on understanding what tattoo pigments break down into. We really don\u2019t understand a lot about laser tattoo removal, and if there is some aspect of tattooing that gives me pause, it\u2019s probably that part. It's a very reasonable concern, I think, that you may have pigments that are entirely safe in the skin, but once you start zapping them with high-powered lasers, we don\u2019t know what you do to the chemistry, and so that could change the dynamic a lot."]},{"begin":"943.000","end":"954.880","lines":["And so we\u2019re trying to figure out how to do that and, I think, making some progress there. And then the last area\u2014which is, is new to us but kind of fun\u2014is actually just looking at the biomechanics of tattooing."]},{"begin":"954.880","end":"984.720","lines":["You would think that we\u2019d really understand how the ink goes into the skin, how it stays in the skin, but the picture there is a little bit hazy, and that really goes to, again, if you\u2019re thinking about \u201cCould you make functional tattoos, or could you just make tattooing better and easier?\u201d And those are sort of important questions to answer. One of the interesting things, when you talk to ink manufacturers and artists, is that they sort of have this intuitive feel for ..."]},{"begin":"984.720","end":"1008.040","lines":["sort of what the viscosity of the ink should be like and how much pigment is in there but can\u2019t necessarily articulate why a particular viscosity is good or why a particular pigment loading is good. And so we think if we understand something about the process by which the ink goes...and so we think understanding the biomechanics could really open some interesting possibilities and lead to better, more interesting tattoos down the road as well."]},{"begin":"1008.040","end":"1039.520","lines":["I hope that made you as excited about the future of tattoo science as it made me.
