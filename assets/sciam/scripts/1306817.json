      "text": ": Hi, this is Tanya Lewis, a senior health and medicine editor at Scientific American. We're taking a short break from our regular programming this week, and looking back at some of our favorite Science, Quickly episodes. I loved this episode my cohost Josh Fischman and I did on the science of napping and how it benefits your brain. Tune in for tips on the best ways to nap, and a description of a fun napping experiment Thomas Edison used to do. Enjoy, and rest up!"

    {
      "author": "Denworth",
      "text": ": Well, because the science shows that my napping is virtuous. There is real power to napping. And though it does depend how long you do it and when you do it and a bunch of things, my napping turns out to fit right in the sweet spot. And so now I feel quite pleased that I have the ability to nap and that it refreshes me in the way that I always felt that it did."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": I\u2019m glad Lydia is taking the shame out of napping. So what\u2019s the sweet spot for naps? Ten minutes? An hour?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Denworth",
      "text": ": Well, the idea is that the best way to nap is to nap for just maybe 20 to 30 minutes and to do it before 5 P.M. if you keep regular daytime hours so it doesn't interfere with your nocturnal sleep. And the reason that 20 to 30 minutes is good has to do with where you are in sleep cycles during that time. So most of your sleep in 20 minutes will be light sleep, N1, and it makes it easier to wake up. If you sleep longer, you will go into a deeper phase of sleep that can be harder to wake up from."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": That definitely rings true to me. I don\u2019t take naps that often. But when I do, I sometimes nap for too long and wake up feeling pretty groggy! So what are the benefits of these shorter naps?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Denworth",
      "text": ": You improve your memory, your information processing, your vigilance, which in scientific terms is your ability to respond to something sudden, like a swerving car. And there's a bunch of other ways in which it improves your mental acuity, but those are the things that show up most strongly."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": That makes sense. I know they say if you\u2019re tired while driving, you should pull over and take a short nap. But I didn\u2019t know about the memory effect. If you take a 20 or 30 minute nap at, say, 1 P.M., it will actually improve your memory?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Denworth",
      "text": ": Yes, it will improve your recall in the subsequent hour or two after the nap. And so if you wake up feeling like, \u201cHey, I feel better able to do my work now,\u201d you're not wrong."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": How did scientists figure this out? Did they have people take naps and then measure their recall?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": That\u2019s exactly what researchers have been doing. Two of them are Ruth Leong and Michael Chee of the National University of Singapore. They work at the Center for Sleep and Cognition there. And in a 2022 study, they found the kind of cognitive benefits to short naps that Lydia was talking about. Also, a nap simply makes people feel better, they learned. Chee says that sleep scientists don\u2019t talk about mood enough. But he and Leong have found, not surprisingly, that tired people are grumpy people. Quick nappers, though, are nicer."

    {
      "author": "Lewis",

    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": So longer naps\u2014like, more than 30 minutes\u2014several times a day could be a sign that there\u2019s an underlying health problem. And you should probably see a doctor."

      "author": "Lewis",

    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Right! Edison famously didn\u2019t like to sleep. He thought it was a waste of thinking time. So when he got tired in his lab, he would sit down and hold a ball in his hand. When he started to relax and doze off, he\u2019d drop the ball. The noise would wake him up. And he thought he actually solved invention problems during that twilight state."

      "author": "Fischman",

    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Yeah, but with a bit of twist. A few years ago some researchers in Paris recruited volunteers to try this. They replaced Edison's ball with a\u00a0 water bottle."

      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": That probably made a loud thump if it hit the floor!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": It would wake me up for sure! Anyway, before people lay down, holding the bottle in their hand, the scientists gave them a math problem, which they couldn't solve. And then they had people lie down holding the bottle, and put electrodes on their head to check which phase of sleep they ended up in. Some people lightly dozed off and dropped the bottle. When those people woke up, the researchers asked them to tackle the math problem again. And a lot of those people got it right.\u00a0 People who didn't drift off enough to drop the bottle or who went into a deeper, heavier phase of sleep\u2014they still had trouble with the math problem."
