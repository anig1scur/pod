But that doesn\u2019t stop scientists who venture out on these rugged trips from having a good time. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to part three of our Friday Fascination miniseries all about field research in Antarctica. This week award-winning journalist Sofia Moutinho is giving us a behind-the-scenes look at life on an icebreaker. From Secret Santa gift exchanges to secret initiation rites, these scientists find plenty of ways to cope with the isolation of spending months at sea."

At the beginning of our trip we had 80 megabytes of Internet data to use on our devices each day. Let me tell you, that is not enough to stream videos or download pictures and barely enough to send texts! Then, after about a week at sea, our location was so remote that we lost even that connection. The ship\u2019s internal e-mail became the only form of communication\u2014no more social media or even Google searches. After the initial shock several people came to appreciate being unreachable.

But it\u2019s sometimes\u2014and most of the time, for me, at least\u2014it\u2019s isolating in a good way, in that the only thing we can do out here is our work, or we have game nights and whatever else to have fun.
