It\u2019s not exactly a pleasure cruise. But that doesn\u2019t stop scientists who venture out on these rugged trips from having a good time. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to part three of our Friday Fascination miniseries all about field research in Antarctica. This week award-winning journalist Sofia Moutinho is giving us a behind-the-scenes look at life on an icebreaker."},{"author":"Rachel Feltman","text":"From Secret Santa gift exchanges to secret initiation rites, these scientists find plenty of ways to cope with the isolation of spending months at sea."},{"author":"Alexis Floback","text":"Okay, come on in! We have the head. So \u201chead\u201d is a term used on ships to mean, like, your toilet. So we have a private bathroom in each cabin on this ship, complete with a shower, toilet and sink."},{"author":"Sofia Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Alexis Floback, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California who studies the role of iron in the ocean. On this cruise she shares a cabin with three other female researchers. They all met and became friends onboard. On the door of their room is a picture of the four of them smiling on deck with a huge iceberg in the background. It was the first iceberg we encountered on our long journey through West Antarctica onboard the U.S. icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer."},{"author":"Floback","text":"In this room we have four people and four cabinets, so we\u2019re a bit short on space. And all of our ECW, or extreme-cold-weather gear, we\u2019ve decided to store here, so that it\u2019s out of the way. This will help keep us warm in the cold Antarctic."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The Palmer is divided into six decks accessed through a maze of stairs and hallways separated by heavy steel doors. Accommodations are humble. Everyone shares these small rooms except for the captain and lead scientists."},{"author":"Floback","text":"And then we each have our own bunk bed. Each bunk bed has these privacy curtains so that you have the ability to shut it because we're all working on different schedules."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Like many others onboard, Alexis and her roommates have tried to make this metallic, cold ship environment as cozy as possible."},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"And I see you\u2019ve done some decoration here with green lights on the ceiling."},{"author":"Floback","text":"Yeah, yeah, one of my cabinmates brought those to add a bit of decoration to the room, to make it a bit more homey."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Even though research trips like this are often called cruises, they are not the kind of nautical getaway you are probably picturing. The routine on a research vessel involves a lot of hard work."},{"author":"Carl Lamborg","text":"So Americans call these \u201ccruises.\u201d And of course, everybody immediately thinks, you know, one of those enormous cruise boats and shuffleboard and so on and so forth."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"This is Carl Lamborg, a chemical oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies mercury in the ocean."},{"author":"Lamborg","text":"Other countries call them \u201cexpeditions,\u201d which sounds much more official and scientific and adventurous. So it\u2019s not a cruise, really: it\u2019s an expedition."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"For the researchers onboard it doesn\u2019t matter if it is day or night, a weekend or even a holiday such as Christmas or New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014work never stops. Marty Fleisher, an oceanographer at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, is used to this rhythm. At age 65 he has been onboard the Palmer in Antarctica three times before this expedition."},{"author":"Marty Fleisher","text":"I\u2019m here to eat and sleep and work, and in some ways that simplifies your life. And you get to do it in a place like Antarctica."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Half of the researchers onboard work shifts of 12 to 16 hours. The other half of them are on duty and available at any time of the day. Margot Debyser, a postdoctoral researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is one of the people working around the clock. [CLIP: Rhythmic noises of a pump on deck]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"She spends long hours on deck setting up pumps that are hung on wire and deployed into the ocean to collect water. It is physically demanding work."},{"author":"Margot Debyser","text":"These pumps, they\u2019re kind of bulky, right\u2014they\u2019re like a meter by a meter [about 3.3 feet by 3.3 feet]. And we put them in a sequence on the wire. So it takes two people to just, like, lift them up and put them on the wire, and then all of us are, like, wheeling the pumps out one by one."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"In this job Margot and her colleagues are constantly exposed to the harsh and rapidly changing Antarctic weather. In a matter of minutes conditions outside can switch from a temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit [3 degrees Celsius] and sunny to snowy with wind gusts as cold as \u20135 degrees [F, or \u201321 degrees C]."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"I think doing things in cold weather, in these conditions, there\u2019s just a lot more, like, considerations and safety equipment that you need to wear. So if I wasn\u2019t wearing gloves, I could definitely be like, \u201cMy God, like, my fingers are getting, like, kind of cold.\u201d I don\u2019t want to risk getting frostbite because, you know, there\u2019s a lot of metal and stuff."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"But Margot often forgets to put on gloves, which can have consequences in these harsh conditions."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"Oh, my God, I\u2019m getting a very bad case of cruise hands. I think your hands are just wet a lot and salty a lot and cold a lot, and your hands just start peeling so badly. And I feel like my hands are like sandpaper right now. When I\u2019m in my bedsheets, they, like, catch onto my bedsheets. It\u2019s kind of gross. And I\u2019ve been trying to do scrubs, but it\u2019s not really worked out."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"With such intense work, keeping a healthy sleep routine is challenging for everyone as well. Between nine-hour-long pump deployments and running samples in the lab, Margot can\u2019t afford a whole night of sleep."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"So I feel like, with my method, it\u2019s more like sleeping when I can, which is some naps in between, kind of. Once my instruments are running and everything looks good, I just nap for, like, two or three hours, and then it\u2019s kind of around the clock."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"This routine makes it hard for people onboard to keep track of the days of the week and the time of day."},{"author":"Debyser","text":"I feel like on land, my perception of time is, like, day to evening, then you go to sleep, and then it\u2019s the next day. And here it kind of, like, all merges into this massive blur, and I feel like it both goes really fast and really slow at the same time. [CLIP: \u201cHandwriting,\u201d by Frank Jonsson]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"It doesn\u2019t help that Antarctica is the only continent in the world without official time zones. Because of that we follow our own made-up time on the ship. We start our journey following the time zone of our departure point in Chile. Then, throughout the trip, the captain announces several time changes so we arrive at our final destination in New Zealand at the local time. With the summer sun shining for 24 hours a day, the hour on the clock doesn\u2019t mean much. Meals become our main way to mark the passage of time."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"I feel this way, and so does Bettina Sohst, a research associate at Old Dominion University who serves as a laboratory supervisor and technician onboard."},{"author":"Bettina Sohst","text":"Every day is the same. The few things that keep you on track are standard meals\u2014like Taco Tuesday, you know, \u201cMust be Tuesday.\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Despite the chaotic work schedule, we can always count on food being served punctually: breakfast, lunch, dinner and midrats, an extra midnight meal for those with late-hour shifts. [CLIP: Chatter of people in the mess hall during mealtime]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The Palmer\u2019s chef, Chad Cavalier, had a grocery list to prepare for this trip that cost more than $130,000. It included countless pounds of meat and frozen vegetables, some 25 cases of frozen fries and 50 jars of Nutella, which were completely devoured by the end of the trip."},{"author":"Marissa Despins","text":"The food on the Palmer has been really great\u2014like, probably the best food I\u2019ve had on a ship."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Marissa Despins, a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She says that even with the excellent food, it\u2019s hard not to long for certain meals."},{"author":"Despins","text":"I feel like when there\u2019s, like, two weeks left of a two-month cruise, you start thinking about foods that you miss from home, and you start dreaming about them. And for me it\u2019s been this kale salad because we ran out of lettuce a little while ago, and I\u2019ve been having dreams about this kale salad."},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"Are you literally dreaming about it when you sleep?"},{"author":"Despins","text":"I definitely had one dream about the salad."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Phoebe Lam, a chemical oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and one of the scientists leading this cruise, came prepared."},{"author":"Phoebe Lam","text":"I need instant noodles\u2014instant noodles. Like, if I\u2019m working 24 hours, and I\u2019m so tired, I have, like, a cup of instant noodles, I perk right up. So that\u2019s my thing."},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"Did you bring your own?"},{"author":"Lam","text":"I did."},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"Me, too. I only brought three."},{"author":"Lam","text":"I only\u2014I only bought 18 [laughs]. [CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Bringing your own snacks can help you cope with homesickness. But isolation is still a big challenge here. We are navigating one of the most remote places on Earth. There is only a satellite phone available for restricted use, and the Internet connection is pretty limited\u2014sometimes even nonexistent. At the beginning of our trip we had 80 megabytes of Internet data to use on our devices each day. Let me tell you, that is not enough to stream videos or download pictures and barely enough to send texts!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Then, after about a week at sea, our location was so remote that we lost even that connection. The ship\u2019s internal e-mail became the only form of communication\u2014no more social media or even Google searches. After the initial shock several people came to appreciate being unreachable. That happened to University of Minnesota doctoral student Nicole Coffey."},{"author":"Nicole Coffey","text":"It\u2019s very isolating, being at sea, and sometimes that isolation can sting a little bit\u2014like when, this is the first time I\u2019ve been at sea for Christmas, and I\u2019m very close with my family. And that kind of hurt a little bit. But it\u2019s sometimes\u2014and most of the time, for me, at least\u2014it\u2019s isolating in a good way, in that the only thing we can do out here is our work, or we have game nights and whatever else to have fun."},{"author":"Nicole Coffey","text":"But it\u2019s nice being able to focus in on what we do in a very different way than we could on land."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Some of the researchers onboard are spending the winter holidays at sea for the second year in a row. People got creative to cope with loneliness. Marissa, for example, asked her loved ones to write letters for her to open on Christmas Eve."},{"author":"Despins","text":"I had, like, eight letters to open from family members and friends, and I also sent them letters, and that was [a] really nice way for me to feel connected to them, even when I\u2019m thousands and thousands of miles away. [CLIP: Sound of Christmas movies on television and chatter during a Christmas decoration party]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The researchers organize a Christmas decoration party. They watch classic Christmas movies together and cut out paper snowflakes to glue around their labs. There is also a Secret Santa gift exchange. On New Year\u2019s Eve, they find a break in the packed schedule to improvise a party."},{"author":"Everyone","text":"[Shouting] Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one [cheer]!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"For one hour the scientists dance around their instruments wearing orange and yellow rubbery overalls, plastic 2024 glasses and head lamps."},{"author":"Despins","text":"It does get sad. It\u2019s sad, missing holidays. But it\u2019s also nice because you\u2019re with a group of people that are also missing holidays, right? And I feel like community is built during the holidays."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"To lighten the mood the researchers come up with silly events, including a ship-wide flannel shirt day and Onesie Wednesday, when people wear funny jumpsuits around. Tara Williams, a doctoral student at Old Dominion University, is one of them."},{"author":"Tara Williams","text":"I am wearing a onesie with little duckies on it. Today is Onesie Wednesday, and we\u2019re just wearing onesies because it\u2019s funny and to keep enthusiasm and happiness going on the ship."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"At the door of the main lab, there is a so-called moralendar, where people can mark made-up festivities and celebration days for the weirdest things. One is French Appreciation Day to honor the two French researchers onboard. There is also Intergalactic Walk like a Penguin Day. Polls scribbled on the computer lab\u2019s whiteboard are also a hit."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"People can ask anything: \u201cDoes your back hurt now: Yes or no?\u201d \u201cDo you consider yourself a nerd: Yes, no or geek?\u201d \u201cHow often do you clean your room?\u201d For the last one, some people vote \u201cnever.\u201d On a typical day we can use a sauna and gym to blow off steam. The most musically inclined researchers even brave some jam sessions. [CLIP: A researcher plays guitar]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"For others the trip is also an opportunity for introspection, and the remoteness becomes a source of inspiration. Bettina stands at the ship\u2019s bow and looks out at the water."},{"author":"Sohst","text":"I\u2019ve had great ideas just staring at the ocean. No pressure, just looking out at no people, just blue\u2014or in this case white ice. Yeah, it\u2019s very cleaning."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"On our journey we had many opportunities to be amazed by Antarctica\u2019s dreamlike landscapes. We navigated close to giant, bright-white glaciers, saw the sea covered in a thick layer of ice and encountered penguins, seals and whales. I will never forget it. Still, most of the time, we are inside the ship."},{"author":"Laura Whitmore","text":"We are in these places that sound very adventurous. We\u2019re in this big, vast ocean. We\u2019re in Antarctica. There\u2019s this very bizarre juxtaposition of being stuck in a very confined space while being amid a very vast space."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Laura Whitmore, a chemical oceanographer at the University of Alaska Fairbanks."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"Of course, there is a spirit of adventure in going to Antarctica\u2014it\u2019s a big journey to even get here. But when I\u2019m here, I do sometimes feel removed from Antarctica itself because I\u2019m here on this vessel."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Between the preparation time we spent onboard before setting sail and the 60 days we were at sea, we were on the Palmer for almost three months. Sharing a confined space for that long, away from everything else, definitely creates a sense of camaraderie."},{"author":"Despins","text":"It feels like you\u2019re at summer camp with a bunch of people interested in the same thing or something similar as you."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Marissa again."},{"author":"Despins","text":"So it\u2019s a lot of fun because you get to go to an interesting place and just be surrounded and immersed in science."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Maybe that\u2019s why, despite the challenges, people on this ship love being at sea. Having gone on more than 20 cruises, Phoebe is still excited about it."},{"author":"Lam","text":"The older I get, the more I like being at sea. Everyone pitches in to help\u2014I love that. It\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t happen in real life\u2014like, on land. Everyone\u2019s too busy with their own lives. But here no one has a life except for the life on the ship. And so this becomes like your village, and you help your village members.

I even get a certificate to prove my membership. As our journey nears its end, on our way from Antarctica to New Zealand, I participate in an old maritime tradition: a \u201csea baptism\u201d ceremony. Such ceremonies are common when crossing geographical landmarks in the ocean such as the equator. For us it marks the crossing of the South Polar Circle at about 66.5 degrees south latitude."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"We had crossed this line at the beginning of our trip, but it was only at the end of the cruise, when the scientists were done with their sampling at sea, that they had time to organize this ritual. The newbies\u2014those onboard who crossed this landmark for the first time during our expedition\u2014get an angry e-mail from King Neptune, the protector of the seas. He invites us to participate in a secret trial, where he accuses us of loitering in his domain."},{"author":"Peter Sedwick (as King Neptune)","text":"To all cowardly trespassers into King Neptune\u2019s southern realm aboard the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer: I have observed that you have been loitering in my most southern domain without my permission. My subjects tell me you have pilfered my beloved sediments, sea ice and snow; stolen my precious water, suspended particles and dissolved gases; and made loud pumping noises, disturbing my peace!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"To avoid punishment, we have to entertain King Neptune\u2014played by Peter Sedwick, a chemical oceanographer at Old Dominion University and another one of the cruise\u2019s leaders."},{"author":"Sedwick","text":"Pay attention, disgusting, disgraceful pirates! [CLIP: Sound of a gavel]"},{"author":"Sedwick","text":"We are here to pass an arraignment and then pass judgment on your grievous, grievous crimes in Neptune\u2019s kingdom. But first, before any charges are read and perhaps to lessen your punishment, you may present some entertainment to please the court. We are happy to receive that before the charges are read. The royal court will be seated."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Unfortunately, I can\u2019t disclose what happened during the trial and what exactly the baptism ceremony entailed. I can only say that I was absolved after being taken blindfolded to see Neptune himself."},{"author":"Sedwick","text":"Congratulations, Sofia! [CLIP: People clap and exclaim]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"I receive the title of Shellback for crossing the international date line, the line from the South Pole to the North Pole that marks the boundary between one calendar day and the next. And I am now also part of the select group called the Order of the Red Nose, for those who have crossed the Antarctic Circle. It feels good that we made peace with King Neptune. I wish making amends for the ways we have interfered with Earth\u2019s climate was that easy."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"But the reality is that the beautiful icy landscapes I\u2019ve seen in Antarctica, the ocean around it and our planet\u2019s climate are moving toward a point of no return as humanity keeps emitting warming greenhouse gases.
