      "text": "Sound has powerful effects on us all the time, even though most of the time we\u2019re not conscious of it because we\u2019ve kind of got into the habit of suppressing our listening. There\u2019s so much noise around us in cities that we get into the habit of ignoring it. Now that\u2019s not a great thing when the noise is having a bad effect on us."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Julian makes a good point \u2013 that sounds affect us all the time, even when we don\u2019t realise. We\u2019re not conscious of it \u2013 so we\u2019re not aware of it, but it is there. It may be irritating us, but we don\u2019t stop to think what it is that\u2019s annoying us."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And another habit we get into is suppressing our listening \u2013 so, preventing or stopping ourselves from hearing the noises. But experts have found this isn\u2019t good for us. That noise in the background can lead to stress and mental health issues."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Yes, we all need some peace and quiet. Of course, there are many techniques for reducing and absorbing noise. For example, trees are grown by motorways to absorb the traffic noise. At a large rock concert, acoustic screens are put up to stop the sound being heard too far away."

      "text": "All sound ideas \u2013 I mean good ideas. But let\u2019s head to the world\u2019s noisiest city \u2013 Mumbai in India - where honking car horns are a big problem."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "I love the sound of that word honk \u2013 a short, loud sound \u2013 but I don\u2019t like the actual noise. The People Fixing the World programme discussed this problem and met a woman who\u2019s been working for years to try and reduce noise levels and create quiet zones."

This is what I was told when I started working, that these are all Western ideas to want to control noise \u2013 Indians love noise! And it\u2019s about the noise, it\u2019s about the colour, it\u2019s about the laughter and happiness, we don\u2019t want to be like the West \u2013 you know, those kind of dull, boring people, who don\u2019t express themselves the way we do!"

So, for example, a sound as high as 100 decibels \u2013 the level produced by a subway train \u2013 can be safely listened to for only 15 minutes each day."
