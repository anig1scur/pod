  "intro": [
    "These days, how well food in a restaurant is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes. By sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious and must go to that restaurant to eat it! Rob and Neil discuss if this means food is now about style over substance - and teach some new items of vocabulary along the way."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, I'll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish \u2013 that's a noun for food prepared for eating \u2013 is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren't they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone \u2013 but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Which isn't very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it!"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "You could argue it's about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Maybe, Rob \u2013 although I'm sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers \u2013 influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here's one of them \u2013 Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar Chick",
      "text": "It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I've got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you'd go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you're seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there \u2013 one that is used so much it has become boring \u2013 what we call a cliche .  The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 and even if it is a cliche \u2013 it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you're promoting food, a photo is everything."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And that's why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It's like a fashion photoshoot for food."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable \u2013 that's looking good enough for people to see \u2013 because people are making choices on what they see. I've also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens\u2026"

      "author": "Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of Oxford",
      "text": "We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain's already imagining what it's going to taste like. And the more beautifully it's presented, the more artistically , that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Right so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food."
