There are a number of projects in the UK at the moment trying to get more women interested in standing for parliament. One of these is the campaign \u2018sign-up-to-stand\u2019 from an organisation called 50:50 Parliament. Lucrece Grehoua is someone who has taken up that challenge and is hoping to stand in upcoming elections. She was a guest on the BBC Radio programme Woman\u2019s Hour. She wasn\u2019t always interested in politics, though. How does she describe it?"

When we see it on TV it looks extremely boring, politics looks boring, especially as a young person and so when I saw that 50:50 Parliament were including women and including young women, including a diverse range of young women, I thought \u2018wow, this is really for me and it can be for me\u2019. So I decided to #signuptostand. Ever since I\u2019ve just been excited at the prospect of me standing for parliament."

Even just as a working class person who hasn\u2019t, you know, been to a private school and who\u2019s come from a disadvantaged background and so I realised politics is for absolutely everybody, it\u2019s just the way that you speak about it has to be tailored to everyone."
