      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "In their time all these movies were blockbusters \u2013 very popular and successful films which sold millions of cinema tickets. And this success was often due to the on-screen romance between the leading actors."

      "text": "But by 2020 and the filming of the BBC television dramas, \u2018Normal People\u2019 and \u2018I May Destroy You\u2019, things had changed. Nudity and sexual content had become commonplace."

      "text": "With actors from the US, what they do have, what they put in place is that with each and every intimate scene we create a nudity / simulated sex waiver , for each and every scene and I actually really like that way of working. In the UK actors are asked to sign a nudity clause and generally that\u2019s an overall, for the whole of a production."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "British actors sign only one document with a nudity clause to cover the whole film. But in the US, actors sign a waiver \u2013 a legal document that allows or prevents an action that is different from how things are usually done."

      "text": "Ita thinks it\u2019s better if the actors agree to each and every scene \u2013 and she uses the phrase, \u2018each and every\u2019 because it emphasises that she means every single one."
