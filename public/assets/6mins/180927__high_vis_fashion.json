  "intro": [
    "Rob and Neil discuss the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble high-vis jacket. They were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they're working in the road or are directing people. So it's strange to think that now people choose to wear them as the latest fashion item. Listen to our discussion and learn new vocabulary along the way."

      "text": "Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they're working in the road or directing traffic. So it's strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend \u2013 that's following the latest fashion."

      "text": "There's also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye-catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone's scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that's going to get a bit of attention  - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we're quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed."

And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends \u2013 the word she used was traction ."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they're sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front."

      "text": "Every time fashion borrows from workwear, there're always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you're charging \u00a32000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn't actually make that much money, you know, there's obviously some thorny class issues there."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class \u2013 so different groups of people in society in different economic positions \u2013 some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily."

      "text": "And we wouldn't want to miss you when you're out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it\u2026 a)    the 1970s, b)    the 1980s or c)    the1990s?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, you know your fashion, Rob \u2013 it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear."

    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Next we mentioned traction . If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated . In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
