Catherine, do you think women's rights are well covered by the media? Catherine Covered means 'talked about'. And I would say it could be better, to be honest. Many women's magazines are all about beauty tips, fashion and how to please your man. Now, I'm interested in the real issues. One thing the media doesn't talk about much is what the role of childless women, like myself, is. And childless means 'having no children'. Li Yes. In some societies, the role of women \u2013 role, the way they are expected to behave \u2013 is to have children. If they don't, it's like there's something wrong with them, and they are supposed to be unhappy. Catherine I have no children and I'm very happy. Anyway, women in various countries around the world want to discuss problems which are close to home. And that's why the BBC has organised a series of programmes to discuss some issues that affect half the world's population. The series is called 100 Women and it's the theme of this 6 Minute English. Li The discrimination against women happens in different ways in different countries. Catherine Discrimination means the unjust treatment of people who belong to different groups - in this case, male and female. Maybe Li, more women should be in positions of power. And that's what today's quiz question is about. Li, how many female heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it:"

One is \"Is news failing women?\", which is obviously at the core of what we are trying to get to. And that will be a live debate held in London but we're going to have people speaking in different countries about that. And we're also doing a big debate called \"What does it mean to be a good girl or an ideal woman?\". December the 1 st we have three topics - leadership, relationships and image - and we're going to do three live debates on that day. And we've sent out packs to over 100 women's groups around the world, so that on the day they all get involved."
