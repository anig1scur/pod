OK, Catherine \u2013 well you are part of a growing trend of people who like to work out \u2013 or exercise in a gym. So perhaps you can tell me, how many people are members of a gym, here in the UK? Is it\u2026 a) 1 in 2, b) 1 in 7 or c) 1 in 10?"

Now let's listen to Philip Mills \u2013 he runs the sports fitness company Les Mills \u2013 named after his father, who was a track and field athlete who represented New Zealand for twenty years. Philip has a theory to explain why group exercise has become so popular in recent years."

      "author": "Philip Mills, CEO of Les Mills International",
      "text": "As people have become more sedentary they've realised that they need to move for their health. We work about 35% more hours than we used to work in the 60s. And people are too busy to play sports. Society has become fragmented and a lot of the things that used to bring people together don't exist anymore. But, you know, we're tribal animals \u2013 pack animals \u2013 and the gym has been one of the things that helps people to commune."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Yes our sedentary lifestyles! We do all spend too much time sitting down, don't we, Rob?"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, and according to Philip we're probably spending more time sitting down than we used to because we're working a lot more."

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And because we're busier with work, we have less time to take exercise."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So why are we choosing to go to the gym these days, rather than heading down to the park to play football? Philip Mills thinks it's because society has become fragmented \u2013 and we're losing the social connectedness that made it easy to get together and take exercise."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And fragmented means broken up into small pieces, by the way. The thing is, we miss that social connectedness \u2013 that feeling of belonging to a group \u2013 because we are essentially tribal animals. And a tribe is a group of people who live together and they share the same language and the same culture."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So even now most of us have left tribal society behind, we still want to feel like we're part of a group that we can commune with \u2013 which means to get close to someone or something."

      "author": "Catherine",

      "text": "And you were wrong, I'm afraid! Figures collected by Leisure Data Base, a company that has audited the fitness industry for fifteen years, show that one in seven of the UK population is a member of a gym.

    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Now number two \u2013 If you push yourself, you force yourself to try harder \u2013 'It's important to push yourself if you want to do well in your exams.'"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Good advice there, Catherine. Next up is 'work out' \u2013 which means to exercise in order to improve your health and fitness. For example, 'Catherine works out three times a week by cycling on the spot.' Our fourth word is 'fragmented' or broken up into small pieces. For example, 'I suffer from fragmented sleep. I wake up five or six times a night.'"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
