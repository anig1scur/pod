It was made by boiling raw coffee beans, and apparently tasted awful! In this programme, we\u2019ll be looking into the history of coffee in Britain, and as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some related vocabulary too. But before that, I have a question for you. The earliest coffee to arrive in Britain took its name from the port in Yemen it was shipped from. So, what was it called? Was it: a) Cappuccino? b) Mocha? or c) Latte?"

      "text": "Britain\u2019s love affair with coffee started with the opening of London\u2019s first coffee shop in 1652. People loved the effect \u2013 coffee made them more talkative and brighter, it kept them awake for longer, and the drink became more and more popular. Within a decade over eighty new coffee shops had opened in the City of London alone"

    {
      "author": "Judith Hawley",
      "text": "It became more of a working-class drink. So, there were coffee shacks and carts like these sort of little street carts that you get still in London, and you get all over New York, that is a cheap, quick drinks to perk you up . And the Temperance Movement sponsored coffee taverns to try to wean working men off going to the pub for lunch. So, it moved. It declined seriously and has never fully recovered even in the current coffee boom."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "In the 17th century there was a coffee boom \u2013 an increase in its popularity. One of the reasons was that coffee perks you up \u2013 gives you more energy and makes you more active."

      "author": "Sam",

      "author": "Judith Hawley",
      "text": "I think if we look at the way coffee consumption is going today it seems to me to set out two quite radical alternatives for the world. One is the world of corporate coffee, the coffee chains existing on a low wage economy. So, you have that kind of mass coffee market on the one hand. One the other hand you have these microlot estates, Fairtrade coffee, the sort of hipster coffee which is as varied and as interesting as fine wines and is made in an artisanal way."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Many customers today are turning away from large coffee chains like Starbucks, in search of a more responsibly sourced cup of coffee. One example of this is Fairtrade , an ethical standards scheme which guarantees a fair price for coffee producers in South America, Africa and Asia."

      "author": "Neil",
