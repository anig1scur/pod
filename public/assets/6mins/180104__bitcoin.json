    "It\u2019s something that makes the world go round, but it doesn\u2019t really exist. In fact, if we all stopped believing in it, it would have no use at all! It is, of course, money. But not just any money, in this 6 minute English, we'll be talking about the infamous Bitcoin. A digital crypto-currency. Is it the same as 'real' money? Can it be trusted? Is it safe? Dan and Neil discuss the issue and teach you six items of vocabulary."

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, crypto is a prefix meaning hidden or secret \u2013 it comes from the word cryptic which means mysterious or difficult to understand. You may have heard about the most popular crypto-currency at the moment, the Bitcoin."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, I think 2004 may have been a little early, and I think 2013 could be a little late, so the smart money\u2019s on 2009."

    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "You are right on the money, which means correct, both times. Bitcoin is just like any other currency except for two things. First, it\u2019s not printed by governments or banks, which means that it\u2019s not legal tender."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Legal tender means the official money that can be used within a country. So that means we can\u2019t use it to pay taxes or settle debts, right?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Exactly. Governments won\u2019t recognise it as an official currency, although it acts just like one. You can use it to buy items from anyone who will accept it, and its value fluctuates ."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Fluctuates means changes in level or amount. And what\u2019s the second thing?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Ah, the second thing is that bitcoin is a digital currency, meaning that with the exception of a few tokens, it largely exists online only. You can\u2019t carry a load of bitcoins around in your pocket!"

      "author": "Neil",

    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Well, no. You see, even though Bitcoin is not regulated by a bank or government, it still has a process that stops people from cheating. There are only two ways to get bitcoins. You either trade them from someone, or you go mining."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Oh wait, I've heard about this. This is when you use your computer to run calculations which verify other Bitcoin transactions. You get rewarded for this \u2018work\u2019 by earning bitcoins."

      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC correspondent A futures contract, a bet on where the currency will be a month from now, soared above 18,000 dollars. That means that investors believe Bitcoin, which started the year worth under 1000 dollars will continue to rise in value, albeit at a slower rate.  But at the big banks there\u2019s still plenty of scepticism about the currency."

      "author": "Dan",

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Ok. Baht for Thailand. Rupee for India and my favourite, Metical for Mozambique. Next we had cryptic . Something which is cryptic is mysterious or difficult to understand. For example, what do rich people need, poor people have and if you eat it, you die?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "A cryptic riddle indeed! I\u2019ll have to think about that. Then we had legal tender , that\u2019s the official money that can be used within a country. The Euro is legal tender within Spain, but what was the legal tender before that?"

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Wasn\u2019t it the Peseta? Then we had fluctuates . If something fluctuates, it changes in amount or level. The stock market fluctuates."

      "text": "But my love for my family never does. Then we had soared , which means increased very quickly. It\u2019s used with this meaning in the context of money, prices and statistics."
