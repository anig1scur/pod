Owen Bennett Jones: A year? But that's an enormous sum of money! Saleemul Huq: Not that enormous compared to what they gave to the banking system when it collapsed. Climate change is a much bigger problem than the banking crisis."

Well, he says rich countries have pledged \u2013 or promised \u2013 to deliver a hundred billion dollars a year to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. However, he suggests that this sum could have been larger \u2013 since more money than this was donated to resolve the banking crisis."

So don't think it's really cost-efficient."
