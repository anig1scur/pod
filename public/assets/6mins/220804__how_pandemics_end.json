    "It's been more than two years and we are still living in the shadow of Covid-19. There have been many pandemics through history, such as the Black Death, and our species has survived. Sam and Neil discuss how pandemics end, and teach you related vocabulary along the way."

But with cases of Covid infections still in the millions, and doctors warning about new variants of the disease, is the pandemic really coming to an end? In this programme, we\u2019ll be finding out how pandemics end, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some related vocabulary as well."

      "text": "Of course, pandemics are nothing new. Ancient texts are full of stories of plagues which spread death and disease before eventually going away. In the Middle Ages, The Black Death that killed over half of Europe\u2019s population lasted for four years. It\u2019s only with modern vaccines that diseases have been eradicated \u2013 completely ended. So, Neil, my question this week is: which disease was eradicated in 1977? Was it: a)    cholera? b)    polio? or c)    smallpox?"

      "text": "Of course, the idea that the pandemic might not be ending isn\u2019t something people want to hear. Most people are sick of worrying about Covid and can\u2019t wait for things to get back to normal. But as Yale University physician, Professor Nicholas Christakis, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry, it\u2019s not just the biological disease that needs to end \u2013 pandemics have a social ending too."

    {
      "author": "Prof. Nicholas Christakis",
      "text": "Pandemics are not just a biological phenomenon, they\u2019re also a social phenomenon, and they end socially. And one of the ways that they end socially is when everyone just sort of agrees that they have ended \u2013 when everyone is simply willing to tolerate more risk. On other words, we sort of declare victory, maybe prematurely , or another way of thinking about it is, we put our heads in the sand."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Biologically Covid still exists in the world and most of us would rather not catch it. But if you\u2019re vaccinated, the risk of getting seriously ill is much lower, so it\u2019s reasonable to make plans to resume normal life. When enough people do this, we declare victory \u2013 a phrase meaning to announce something to be finished before it actually is, but when it looks \u2018good enough\u2019."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The danger is that we declare victory prematurely \u2013 too soon, before it\u2019s the best time to do so. Professor Christakis uses another idiom for this \u2013 to bury your head in the sand , meaning to deliberately refuse to accept the truth about something you find unpleasant."
