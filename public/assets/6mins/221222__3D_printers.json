  "intro": [
    "Printers have come a long way since the printing press was first invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1436 in Germany. 3D printers - printers which can build solid, three-dimensional objects out of a variety of materials - are today providing solutions to many problems. Sam and Neil look at the role 3D printers are playing in medicine, and they teach you some related vocabulary as well."

Unlike a sculptor who chips away at a block of stone to reveal a shape underneath, 3D printers work in the opposite way, building up physical objects by adding material layer on layer. And the ability to print objects in this way is providing solutions to many problems, as we\u2019ll be finding out\u2026"

The idea of printing solid objects is not new, but it was only after the millennium that tech companies began to realise how it could be done.

You can put them in schools, you can put them in universities\u2026Ohh, it's actually really great for prototyping\u2019. And then people got excited about it and it became the answer to everything. Everything was going to be 3D-printed!"

They realised that 3D printers had many uses - for example, they discovered that 3D printers were great at making prototypes \u2013 models of a product that can be tested, improved and used to develop better products."

It\u2019s prosthetic, so the new eye doesn't restore Stephen\u2019s sight, but it has boosted his confidence. Surgeon, Mandeep Sagoo, led the team at Moorsfield Hospital that operated on Stephen\u2019s eye. Here he is explaining more to BBC World Service\u2019s, People Fixing The World:"
