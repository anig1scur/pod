In this programme, we\u2019ll be meeting two people whose family history has caused them to consider changing their name. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

But names change a lot between cultures and religions. Many Muslim boys are named Mohammed, Indian boys are often called Ram or Krishna, and in Mexico, some boys are named Jesus. So according to a recent global survey, what is currently the world\u2019s most popular boys\u2019 name? Is it:"

      "text": "OK Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. In Britain, a person\u2019s first name is also called their Christian name , and in Christianity, many names have a religious meaning. The name John, for example, means \u2018God is good\u2019. Anderson Jeremiah is the Bishop of Edmonton. He was born in South India, but he doesn\u2019t have a traditional Indian sounding name. Here, Bishop Jeremiah explains the roots of his name to BBC World Service programme, Heart and Soul:"

      "author": "Bishop Anderson Jeremiah",
      "text": "It was the name of one John Anderson. He was the first educational missionary who came and worked and set up several schools in South India, who had very noble ambitions, but also as with any missionaries, he was a big collaborator of the colonial establishment at that point in time, so he has a very a strong baggage that goes with it. So, Anderson is my Christian name, and Jeremiah is my dad's name."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Bishop Anderson Jeremiah\u2019s name comes from another man, John Anderson, a Christian missionary during the British empire. The history of the British empire in India is controversial with many views on all sides. Bishop Jeremiah thinks that some of the empire\u2019s missionaries were noble , meaning admirable or morally good."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But nevertheless, John Anderson was part of a violent and exploitative empire. Bishop Jeremiah uses the word baggage to describe the beliefs, especially outdated or unhelpful beliefs, which influence how people think. Emotional baggage tends to influence the feelings of one individual, while historical baggage can affect whole societies."

Low-status Indians, including Bishop Anderson\u2019s grandparents, escaped social discrimination by converting to Christianity and taking another, Christian, name. But elsewhere in the British Empire, names were connected with something completely unchristian: slavery."
