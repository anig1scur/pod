    "Some solutions to deal with climate change could damage the environment. An idea under scrutiny is deep-sea mining - the exploration of metals used for 'green' products, which could undermine delicate ocean ecosystems. Sam and Neil discuss the topic and teach you related vocabulary."

The idea, known as deep-sea mining, could provide the metals like copper, nickel and cobalt which are needed for the green technology used in electric car batteries and other renewable energy. But could deep-sea mining actually damage delicate ocean ecosystems as well?"

      "text": "We\u2019ll be hearing from two experts and learning some new vocabulary soon, but first I have a question for you, Sam. Mammals like dolphins and whales represent a tiny amount of all marine biodiversity - the thousands of animal species living in the sea. Even all the different types of fish combined make up less than 3% of all living things in the ocean. So, according to recent estimates by Unesco oceanographers, how many different marine species have their home in the ocean? Is it:"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Sam, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Deep-sea mining is supported by some scientists because it could provide the raw materials, especially metals, needed to power electric cars. Amongst them is, Bramley Murton, a professor of marine biology at Southampton\u2019s National Oceanographic Centre. Here he outlines the problem to BBC World Service\u2019s, Science in Action."

      "text": "As in so many things in life, there's a real kind of paradox or a conundrum . The global grid capacity by 2050 will have to increase by three times. Electrical car ownership is set to increase by a factor of 25. Solar and wind generation is going to grow by a factor of a hundred. All of these things which we need to do to decarbonise are going to require raw materials and metals in particular. So, as a society we\u2019re faced with this conundrum. We need to decarbonise."

      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Professor Murton describes the situation using two words. Firstly, he calls it a conundrum \u2013 a problem that is very difficult to solve. He also calls it a paradox \u2013 a situation that seems impossible because it contains two opposite ideas. Deep-sea mining could damage the ocean, but paradoxically it might provide rare metals needed to decarbonise the planet."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "At the heart of the problem is that, in the future, green activities like driving electric cars and using solar power is going to increase by a factor of a hundred. If something increases by a factor of a certain number, it becomes multiplied that many times."

My concern is that it really will be opening a door to something much more than those tests \u2013 it\u2019s leading down a rather slippery slope I think, towards this getting permission for deep-sea mining to be open on a commercial scale."

She thinks the tests which have been permitted to assess the difficulty of mining underwater could open the door to mining on a large scale which would damage fragile marine eco-systems beyond repair. If you open the door to something, you allow something new to start, or make it possible."
