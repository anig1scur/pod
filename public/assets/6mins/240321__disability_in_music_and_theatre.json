    "The UK's Equality Act of 2010 guaranteed the rights of disabled people to equal access to education, employment, and services, including music, theatre and the arts. Despite this, it's still difficult for disabled musicians and music fans to perform and see live music. Neil and Georgie introduce you to some ways people are trying to change this, while teaching you some useful vocabulary."

The phrase lived experience emphasises the unique experience of disabled people, plus the fact that this gives them knowledge and understanding that others do not have. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

      "text": "OK, Georgie, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Megan Steinberg is a music composer at Royal Northern College of Music, where she collaborates with Drake Music, a leading national organisation working in music disability and technology. Megan composes music to be played by \u2018new instruments\u2019. Here she explains what a \u2018new instrument\u2019 is, to BBC Radio 3 programme, Arts & Ideas:"

They might be mass-produced , that\u2019s when a factory makes a lot of the same thing, or bespoke, made specially for one person in particular. So, what are these new instruments like? Listen as Megan introduces the Rainbow Harp, a new instrument which was designed for harpist, Morwenna Louttit-Vermaat, to BBC Radio Programme, Arts & Ideas:"

      "author": "Megan Steinberg",

So, Morwenna is dyslexic , and she really found that traditional black and white musical notation was quite an obstacle for her in learning and teaching music, so she and her husband made these harps and they're, like, really colourful, as she uses colour in music\u2026"

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The strings of a Rainbow Harp are colour-coded : different colours are used to represent and separate out different strings and to produce different notes. It\u2019s a great idea, and an inclusive way for disabled musicians to share their talent with music fans across the UK. Which reminds me of my question, Georgie\u2026"

The good news for all music fans living in London is that The Southbank Centre is accessible, ready and waiting! OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with lived experience , the things that someone has experienced personally for themselves, rather than heard or read about."
