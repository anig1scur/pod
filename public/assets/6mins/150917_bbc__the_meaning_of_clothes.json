      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes. But the meaning of clothes goes far deeper than what you should or shouldn't wear in the workplace, Will. It can really influence what people think of us. Now, rightly or wrongly, they can make snap judgements - or quick decisions - about us."

      "author": "Will",

      "text": "Saris encircle the waist, are often pleated and then swept across the upper body with folds and fabric draped over the shoulder or veiling the head. There are more than 80 different ways of wearing a sari and they've been worn in the Indian subcontinent since the first millennium. It's a garment woven into the histories of the countries from which it comes."
    },
    {
      "author": "Will",

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It is, isn't it? Some Asian women in the West wear saris just for ceremonial occasions \u2013 that means special events like weddings. I suppose, in a sense, it's not that practical for day-to-day use. But it certainly makes a beautiful splash of colour \u2013 or a display of colour - when they do wear it."

      "author": "Will",

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, Will. I do know that actually. It was my attempt at a joke. But you're right: the British dress sense has become a bit samey (it looks the same) \u2013 apart from the fashion industry, which is highly regarded throughout the world."

      "text": "And yet the sari makes me feel safe too because I associate it with her body and the world she made for me. And now, as I struggle to keep hold of the sari, the rituals and the memories around it, I fear losing the world it signifies \u2013 and her, too."
    },
    {
      "author": "Will",

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And she uses the word signifies, which means giving the meaning of something. The sari obviously has an emotional attachment for her."
