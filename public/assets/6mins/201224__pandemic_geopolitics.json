Our ancestors all lived through big pandemics, some of them which were much more lethal than coronavirus. And one of the products of living together in high-density populations, going back as far as historical records go, is you find there are transitions of disease from animals to human beings and they inflict damage. And that damage typically you measure in mortality rates but then the economic and social consequences of disease. There\u2019s a lot of examples in history to learn from."

If you\u2019re a country like the UK which is the centre of all global flight routes , then the incidence of people going backwards and forwards, in and out of your country - you\u2019re going to spread and catch much quicker. The scorecard is very mixed and there\u2019ve been some democratic systems that have been extremely resilient and robust at anticipating it and some that have got it wrong."
