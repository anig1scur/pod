In 213 BC, mirrors were used to reflect sunlight back onto Roman ships attacking the city of Syracuse, causing them to catch fire. But which ancient Greek philosopher was responsible for this solar heat ray? Was it:"

Our first surprising solar project takes place in one of the world\u2019s biggest car parks, owned by US supermarket giant, Walmart. Joshua Pearce, a researcher at Western University in Ontario, Canada, wants Walmart to introduce solar canopies in all their car parks."

Joshua\u2019s canopies protect customers\u2019 cars from the sun and rain, while the solar panels fixed on top generate electricity. This electricity can be used by the supermarket, or given to customers to charge their electric car for free. Here\u2019s Myra Anubi, presenter of BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World, discussing Joshua\u2019s idea:"
