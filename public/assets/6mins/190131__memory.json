There are many ways we can improve our memory but one way is through the type of food we eat. According to the BBC Food website, which type of food supports good memory function? Is it\u2026 a)  eggs b)  spinach, or c)  bananas?"

    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, I'll have the answer later on. Now, let's talk more about improving our memory. Memory is the ability to encode, store and recall information but a number of factors can affect people\u2019s memory processes including health, anxiety, mood, stress and tiredness."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, that's one way. But people have different styles to help them remember. According to the BBC's iWonder guide, there are three different styles - visual, auditory and kinaesthetic , that's learning by \u2018doing\u2019 and practicing something over and over again. That sounds like me."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But recently, a new study has come up with a method that could possibly be the best way to improve your memory and that's by drawing. Daryl O'Connor, who's Professor of Psychology at the University of Leeds, has been speaking about it on the BBC Radio 4 programme, All In The Mind. See if you can work out why\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "Daryl O'Connor, Professor of Psychology at the University of Leeds",
      "text": "The authors certainly argue that one of the things that happens by drawing these particular objects, that it leads to this increased contextual representation of the object in one's mind\u2026 It makes a lot of intuitive sense \u2013 the idea that if you have encoded something in a greater level of detail, you're more likely to remember it\u2026 It's much stronger than just remembering writing down the words."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, so let's try to explain that. Drawing something leads to increased contextual representation of the object. When something is contextual , it is in the situation where it usually exists."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So as you draw something you are creating a picture in your mind about what it is, how you use it and where it is used. I wonder if this means artists have good memories\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Maybe. Daryl O'Connor says that when you draw you are encoding something in a greater level of detail, more than you would by just writing things down. Encoding is changing information into a form that can be stored and later recalled."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "That's because as you draw, you're thinking about different aspects of the object. He says it makes intuitive sense \u2013 intuitive means it is 'based on feelings rather than facts or proof' - so, you just feel it is the best thing to do."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Of course this is just one more way to improve your memory. I have also heard that doing crossword puzzles and Sudoku can help, especially when you're older."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, as we get older we can often have more difficulty retrieving information from our memory - and people with Alzheimer\u2019s find it very difficult to encode information \u2013 so any way to keep our memory working is a good thing. Basically we need brain training!"

Apparently, foods rich in B vitamins are important as they provide protection for the brain as we age and support good memory function. I think it's time to change my diet! Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme."
