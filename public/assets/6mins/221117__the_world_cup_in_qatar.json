But this year, for the first time ever, the competition is taking place in winter. Why? Because the 2022 World Cup is happening in Qatar."

      "text": "Over a million fans from all over the world are expected to visit Qatar for the World Cup which starts on the 20th of November. Because temperatures in Qatar exceed 45 degrees in the summer, the competition was moved to the winter. But the decision to hold the World Cup in the tiny, oil-rich Gulf state has been controversial."

      "text": "One of the richest countries in the world, Qatar has no tradition of playing football and some have criticised the focus on money instead of sport. And there are other criticisms too \u2013 about human rights and the treatment of the migrant construction workers who built the football stadiums, roads, transport systems and hotels without which the World Cup could not happen."

      "text": "OK, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Advertising for the Qatar World Cup shows football fans staying in new hotels and watching matches in air-conditioned stadiums. But hidden behind this, the lives of the migrant workers from Nepal, India and other South Asian countries reveal a very different story."

They include workers reporting having paid exorbitant and illegal recruitment fees to secure work abroad on two-year contracts, and then finding out they\u2019re coming on three-month visas, which means that they're not able to make up or recoup the price that they've paid to actually get this job, and may well be sent home in debt on top of everything else."

      "author": "Neil",

Because they couldn\u2019t make enough money, many returned home in debt \u2013 owing money to someone that they will have to pay back. What\u2019s worse, many have died building the football stadiums, in accidents, or due to overwork and heat stress."

James Dawsey is an expert on the politics of football in the Middle East. Here he explains to BBC World Service\u2019s, Business Daily, that for Qatar, hosting the World Cup is more about improving its international reputation than economics:"

Because Qatar isn\u2019t as powerful as its bigger neighbours, it uses soft power \u2013 the way a country uses its economic and cultural influence to persuade other countries, instead of using military power. Hosting an important international event like the World Cup is a part of Qatar\u2019s soft power strategy to be considered an important country on the world stage."
