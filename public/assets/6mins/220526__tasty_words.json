When synesthetes, as they\u2019re called, hear a word, their sense of taste also becomes activated. Words produce specific tastes on their tongues. For example, when Jen hears the name of her daughter, Sophia, she tastes pink marshmallows! And the name \u2018Leo\u2019 tastes like noodles."

We\u2019ve just heard what happens when Jen McCready hears the names \u2018Sophia\u2019, and \u2018Leo\u2019, but what does she taste when she hears the name \u2018Neil\u2019? a) eggs and bacon b) spaghetti hoops c) a jam sandwich?"

Synaesthesia isn\u2019t only about people, like Julie and Jen, who taste words - it can be a mixing of any of our senses. A synesthete may hear colours or see sounds. In fact, there could be as many as 150 different types of synaesthesia."

And with an estimated 4% of the world population having some form of sense mixing, a world of new and exciting possibilities is opening up to millions."
