Anyone who's seen cows grazing knows it\u2019s usually animals that eat plants, but some plants have turned the evolutionary tables to eat animals instead.

Plants have been on the planet for hundreds of millions of years longer than humans, and have used that time to evolve special skills. Here\u2019s Professor Rick Karban, a biologist at the University of California, explaining more to James Wong, botanist and presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Is Eating Plants Wrong?"

Studies modelled on the famous Pavlov\u2019s dog experiment, have trained pea seedlings to find the quickest route to light through a maze, and remember it \u2013 evidence of memory. In another experiment, potted plants were lined up with roots joining them like a chain of people holding hands. The plants talked to each other, passing along information about water and air temperature through their roots, like children playing a game where a message is passed on, in a whisper, through a chain of people, becoming distorted in the process. Distorted means changed from its original form."

We have to first of all think about what kinds of plants we are eating, what are the parts of those plants? Are we in fact destroying the entire living being, or just taking certain of its parts such as fruits and leaves that are not essential to it that can actually fall off without doing harm to the whole organism?"

Picking an apple, for example, is okay because it doesn\u2019t kill the tree itself which can go on to produce more fruit."
