The older of the two comes from the word \u2018thrive\u2019 etymologically, and described thrift as the ability to live well and to flourish , so it\u2019s that sense of human flourishing. The more recent definition is the one we\u2019re probably more familiar with which is about frugality . All of that said, it\u2019s been used historically of course by various people in various moments in various different places in very different ways and they\u2019ve often had a social or religious agenda ."

There\u2019s no point denying that, certainly in the developed world, there\u2019s been a rise in consumer capitalism, that\u2019s just a truism , but thrift hasn\u2019t declined."
