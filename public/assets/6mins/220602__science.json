Recent events like the Covid pandemic and climate crisis have put scientists under pressure from critics motivated by political views. Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks facts are not dependent on politics, but should be established with the scientific method, a process of finding the truth through testing and experimentation."

This process is called \u2018peer review\u2019 - other scientists double-checking the experiment to make sure everything was done correctly. One way they do this is to duplicate , or repeat, the experiment to see if they get the same result."

As protests by anti-vaccine groups and climate change deniers have shown, many Americans, even presidents, seem suspicious of scientific fact.

It\u2019s currently taught as a body of information, a satchel of facts that are imparted upon you and then you regurgitate that for an exam. That\u2019s an aspect of science, but it\u2019s not the most important part of science. The most important part of science is knowing how to question things and knowing when an answer has emerged that represents an objective truth about this world."
