Karaoke was invented in Japan and its name is a combination of different Japanese words \u2013 but what words? What is the meaning of \u2018karaoke\u2019? Is it:"

      "text": "OK, Georgina. I\u2019ll take that as a compliment. But however good - or bad - my singing may be, there\u2019s no doubt that the act of singing itself is a very complex skill, involving a huge number of processes in our bodies and brains. So what happens physically when we sing a musical note?"

      "author": "Georgina",

      "author": "Marijke Peters",
      "text": "Vocal folds, also called vocal cords , are crucial here. They\u2019re two flaps of skin stretched across your larynx that vibrate when you sing and create a sound. The pitch of that sound, how high or low it is, depends on the frequency of their vibration, so if you want to hit the right note they need to be working properly."

      "author": "Georgina",

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "So why do some people (Neil!) find it hard to sing in tune? Is it because they cannot physically reproduce sounds? Or because they hear sounds differently from the rest of us?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, according to psychology professor, Peter Pfordresher, it\u2019s neither. He thinks that for poor singers the problem is generally not in the ears or voice, but in their brains \u2013 specifically the connection between sound perception and muscle movement."
