  "intro": [
    "Grandmothers in Zimbabwe are being trained to provide therapy to people in their community. The African country has over 14 million people but fewer than 20 psychiatrists. After years of economic turmoil, unemployment and HIV, mental health is a huge challenge, and doctors estimate that one in four Zimbabweans suffers from depression or anxiety. Neil and Sam discuss the project and teach you vocabulary along the way."
