  "intro": [
    "How do you feed the world's ever-growing population when the amount of land available to grow things is getting smaller? Could pond scum be the answer? Scientists say this microalgae, which can be grown almost anywhere, could be part of the solution. Neil and Sam discuss the latest superfood craze and teach you some useful vocabulary too."

In the early 2010s, many juice bars started popping up in places around the world selling green smoothies - energy drinks made by blending healthy ingredients like kale, chard and spinach. The recent trend for microalgae and spirulina has been promoted in part by big drinks companies wanting to sell the latest brightly coloured smoothies."

So it doesn\u2019t use much agricultural land, which is becoming stretched , meaning there\u2019s not enough of it to meet the world\u2019s food needs. Sustainable intensification is another possible solution to this problem, because it is a way of increasing food production without harming the environment or using new land.
