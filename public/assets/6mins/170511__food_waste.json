      "text": "Yes, let\u2019s. First we had waste . If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we waste are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with waste too. Can you think of one, Dan?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "A waste of space is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I\u2019m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can\u2019t cook at all. Next we had leftovers. Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your leftovers , Neil?"

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Not if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had a household name . To be a household name is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Oh, that\u2019s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had infrastructure . Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society \u2013 such as electricity supply, trains, and roads."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "And finally we had abundance . If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in abundance , Neil?"
