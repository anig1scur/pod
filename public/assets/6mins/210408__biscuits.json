And before we do that, Rob, let\u2019s test your knowledge of biscuits with a question. The British aren\u2019t the only fans of biscuits. So in which country are barazeks traditionally eaten? Is it in\u2026 a) Syria, b) Morocco, or c) Spain?"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "They can be sweet or savoury \u2013 but I prefer the sweet ones that are crisp, crunchy and are good for dunking in my tea. Dunking means dipping into liquid for a short period of time."

      "text": "But enough about your eating habits, Rob. Let\u2019s find out how the biscuit got its name. It\u2019s something the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth has been exploring. Dr Laura Wright, a historical linguist from the University of Cambridge, explains its origins\u2026"

      "author": "Dr Laura Wright, historical linguist, University of Cambridge",
      "text": "From Latin \u2018biscoctum\u2019 \u2013 twice cooked. And it comes to us via Anglo-Norman French, but it\u2019s bread that\u2019s been cooked twice to extract all the moisture so that it goes hard, and it\u2019ll stay fit for consumption for a very long time, which is why you can take it to sea and have a sea biscuit... and from the 1500 at least we spelt it like it sounds \u2018bisket\u2019\u2026 but at some point, in the 1800, we started to prefer the French spelling for reasons of poncy-ness!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, the English word for biscuits has its origins in Latin. It describes cooking bread twice to make it hard. This baking process meant a biscuit could be kept for a long time, and as Dr Wright said, it would stay fit for consumption \u2013 another way of saying \u2018 edible\u2019 or able to be eaten."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "That\u2019s why they were taken on long sea voyages \u2013 but they weren\u2019t like the biscuits we eat now \u2013 they were plain, simple and very hard baked. Interestingly, the word biscuit used to be spelt B-I-S-K-E-T but the French spelling B-I-S-C-U-I-T was later adopted."

    {
      "author": "Anastasia Edwards, author",
      "text": "One key fact in the rise in the popularity of the biscuit is meal times. Before the Industrial Revolution, people have a later breakfast and earlier supper. By the end of the Industrial Revolution, breakfast is much earlier, the evening meal is much later, so you\u2019ve got this big gap of time where people need sustenance , and so lunch comes to greater prominence and tea time comes to greater prominence, and snacking \u2013 so there\u2019s this great opportunity for biscuits \u2013 something small, something ready, something easily consumable, not expensive, you know, a bit of a sugar rush ."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Right, so it was the Industrial Revolution that led to the rise \u2013 that's the increase \u2013 in the popularity of biscuits. Because the time between breakfast and dinner in the evening increased, people got hungry and they needed food to give them energy \u2013 what Anastasia called sustenance ."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So, this is when smaller meals, such as lunch or tea, became important or more well-known \u2013 it had greater prominence . And this included snacking on biscuits. These were cheap and easily consumable \u2013 easy and quick to eat. And because of their ingredients, they gave you a sugar rush -  a quick blast of energy."
