    "For some, it's a companion when it comes to relaxing at the end of a hard day. For others, it's a complex elixir which requires study and involves almost a ritual. We are talking about wine. Rob and Sam talk about the life of a sommelier and teach you related vocabulary along the way."

Encodes means changes the information into something that we can use or understand. Drinking more expensive wine makes you think it tastes better. So perhaps, when buying supermarket wine or wine in a restaurant, it may be better telling yourself that the cheaper option is OK!"
