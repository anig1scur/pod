There are lots of social media platforms out there \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram \u2013 and they're all different, and the question is, do we use different identities when we are using different digital spaces? And what's all this tweeting, posting, and hashtagging doing to our language and our psyche?"

So for example, your Twitter handle will have a \u2018you' that is probably different from a \u2018you' that you share if, say, for example you have a Facebook account, or is different from a \u2018you' that you would share if you're on a particular forum of something that you like \u2013 some music that you like, or food that you like, or whatever it is."

And, also, in order to basically reach out and tell people, 'Hey we're around'. It's like having a telephone on all the time: \u2018Hey, chat to me. I'm here. Anybody wanna hang out?' It's a big social playground."
