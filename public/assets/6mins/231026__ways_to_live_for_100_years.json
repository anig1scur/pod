      "text": "OK, Beth, we\u2019ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Of all the many factors for long life such as diet, exercise, and keeping active, human relationships are among the most important. People who are more connected with others, and have warmer relationships live longer and stay healthier. And according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, talking here with BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry, those relationships don't necessarily have to be with humans:"

      "author": "Dr Robert Waldinger",
      "text": "Introverts actually find having a lot of people around stressful, so they might only need one or two close people and that's all they need, that's all they want, and that's just fine for them. So one size doesn't fit all when it comes to how many relationships you need to have a healthy life. It doesn't have to be done with another human\u2026 we know that pets provide us with a great deal of comfort and joy and pets can calm us down."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Whether you\u2019re a shy introvert or noisy extrovert, what counts is friendship, be that with a human or a pet. Different things work for different people, so Dr Waldinger says it\u2019s not one-size-fits-all , a phrase meaning something which is suitable for everyone or every purpose."

      "text": "So far, we\u2019ve mentioned the importance of diet, exercise and friendship, but some people want more radical ways of defying death and staying young. Dr Nir Barzilai, director of the American Federation for Ageing Research, has developed three scenarios in his work with centenarians in the US."

      "author": "Beth",

      "author": "Dr Nir Barzilai",
      "text": "The second scenario is what we call 'The Wolverine' or the Fountain of Youth: taking old people and make them young. This is very, very hard, this will be the most complex things we can do. And the third scenario, and this is a very exciting scenario, and we have some evidence that it works, is the Peter Pan scenario . Peter Pan didn't grow old - the idea that you take people when they're 20 or 30 and give them a treatment every few months or every year. And you'll basically erase their ageing and let them age very, very slowly, which also will mean probably that they'll pass their 115 year maximum potential lifespan."

      "text": "All Dr Barzilai\u2019s treatments are aimed at extending lifespan , the length of time someone is normally expected to live. His second treatment, making someone who is old, younger, is called the Fountain of Youth , a legendary source of magical water that keeps anyone who drinks it young forever."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Dr Barzilai\u2019s third treatment involves slowing down the ageing process so much that people hardly age at all. This treatment is called Peter Pan, after the fictional boy who never grew up, and is connected to another idiom, Peter Pan syndrome , which describes an immature person who has reached adulthood but refuses to take on adult responsibilities."
