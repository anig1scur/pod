They can eat four times as much as native species. BBC World Service programme \u2018People Fixing the World\u2019 went to investigate. Here\u2019s Marisol Amaya talking to Celso Sho from marine conservation NGO, \u2018Blue Ventures\u2019 about attempts by the Belizean government to get people to eat lionfish."

OK, now let\u2019s recap the vocabulary that we\u2019ve looked at today. If something is resilient , then it\u2019s very hard to damage."
