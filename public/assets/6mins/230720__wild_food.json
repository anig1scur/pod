So, according to the group\u2019s website, what is the most popular food foraged in the UK? Is it: a)    seaweed? b)    berries?  or, c)    mushrooms?"

      "text": "OK. I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. Monica Wilde, known as Mo, is the author of The Wilderness Cure, a book charting her year of eating only wild food. Mo is one of a group of 26 experienced foragers taking part in the \u2018Wild Biome Project\u2019, a three-month experiment into the health benefits of introducing wild food into your diet."

The idea is that natural unprocessed foods found in the wild support our microbiome, leading to a range of health benefits from weight loss to increased energy levels. The foragers\u2019 microbiome is measured and monitored before, during and after the experiment. Here\u2019s Mo Wilde chatting with one of the foragers, Rob Gould, for BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."

They all report greater appreciation for the smell and taste of their food, and say foraging has given them increased self-worth, a natural treatment for depression and anxiety. Here\u2019s one forager describing her feelings to BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."
