    "There's a new look in town, which some people are calling 'scumbro'. Scumbro combines the word 'scummy', which means 'dirty and messy', with the word 'bro', which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men \u2013 but women can adopt it too. Find out more about it in this programme."

And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion \u2013 well sort of. And that's what we're discussing today \u2013 is looking like you're dressing in charity shop clothes a new fashion statement?"

And I think, like most of these trends, they're started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it's been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things ."

      "text": "Amber Graafland, Fashion & Beauty Director, Daily Mirror It's all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it's not just about looking like you've rummaged in a teenager's dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items \u2013 you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme \u2013 while it's basically about looking simultaneously like you've made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Wow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It's not just about looking messy \u2013 like you've rummaged in a teenager's dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that's mixed up with lots of other things."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "No don't be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you've not made any effort but at the same time, you're show you have made an effort! And that's the meaning of the word simultaneously \u2013 doing one thing at the same time as another thing."
    },

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "The issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford \u2013 but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they're wearing second-hand clothes \u2013 and the charity shops aren't making any money from it."
