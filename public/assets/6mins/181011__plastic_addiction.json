The first synthetic plastic \u2013 that's plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. Do you know what its brand name was?

At the one time, we're so horrified by what we're seeing \u2013 the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic, beaming in from all over the world, and at the same time we're being told we can't live without it, so that creates a psychological dissonance \u2013which I think is the barrier to behavioural change but I'm finding now awareness has peaked and it's going over into activism ."

This has created what Lucy says is a 'psychological dissonance' - dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas \u2013 so we're having an argument in our head about the right thing to do \u2013 this is the 'push and pull' of thoughts she referred to."

We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture."

It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands \u2013 we need to be more careful about how and when we use it \u2013 and use our collective power to force change if it's needed."
