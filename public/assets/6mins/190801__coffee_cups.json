  "intro": [
    "Most takeaway coffee cups are not recyclable because they're lined with plastic. One big coffee shop chain has introduced a 5p levy for using a disposable cup to encourage people to bring their own; another one pledged to recycle as many disposable coffee cups as they produce by 2020. Neil and Rob discuss if this is enough to encourage coffee drinkers to behave in a more environmentally-friendly way. And they teach you related vocabulary."

Some of the big chains are now charging customers more for a disposable cup and giving discounts if people bring their own reusable . However not all of the shops actually collect old cups and sort them for recycling in the shop itself. Here\u2019s Jaz Rabadia from Starbucks, Is the store only interested in facilities inside their shops?"
