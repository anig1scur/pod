      "author": "Dan",

    {
      "author": "Sophie Medlin",
      "text": "As the blood sugars drop, we increase our cortisol and adrenalin \u2013 so our kind of fight or flight hormones \u2013 and those have an impact on our brain and the neuropeptides \u2013 the things that control our brain, the chemicals in our brain, the ones the trigger for hunger are the same ones that trigger for anger and also for rage and impulsive type behaviours. So that\u2019s why you get that sort of same response."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So it\u2019s all to do with blood sugar, isn\u2019t it?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Yes, it seems so. When we are hungry the level of sugar in our blood is lower and this causes an increase in particular hormones. Hormones are the chemicals we make in our bodies that control certain biological and psychological functions."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The hormones released when we are hungry are the same as our fight or flight hormones. They are the hormones that the body uses to prepare us to either fight or run away from a dangerous situation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "When these hormones are increased, it can cause anger and rage. Rage is another word for being very angry."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And when we are angry we can behave impulsively. Impulsive behaviour is when we do things without thinking, without considering the consequences."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "So when we are hungry, the same emotions can run through us. We can be angry and make poor decisions. And that is hanger."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "I haven\u2019t quite reached rage yet. This was another of our words, rage, and it means a state of being very, very angry."

We just do them without any control and without thinking about the consequences. Neil Now I\u2019m off, I\u2019m starving. I\u2019ve got to eat before I do something impulsive.
