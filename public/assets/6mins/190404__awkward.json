    "We all know the feeling. That horrible uncomfortable silence where we freeze up, or look away or just want to turn invisible. Awkwardness can strike anyone in the wrong circumstances. But why does it happen? How is it connected to rules and what does it have to do with society? Neil and Dan find out and teach you related vocabulary."

New York was 1904 and Tokyo, 1927. Well done, and extra bonus points if you knew any of those dates. Now it's time for our vocabulary.
