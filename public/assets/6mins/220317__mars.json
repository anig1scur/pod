      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But before we go on, I have another question which needs answering, Sam. The ancient Romans were also interested in Mars. They even considered the planet to be a god \u2013 but god of what? Was Mars the Roman god of: a) Love? b) Fire? or, c) War?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Well, Mars is the \u2018Red Planet\u2019, so I guess the answer is b) the Roman God of Fire."

      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Whatever the Romans thought, civilisations throughout history have described looking into the night sky and seeing a bright, red light. But where does Mars\u2019 characteristic colour come from?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Someone who can answer that is Dr Michael Meyer. As lead scientist on NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Programme, he spent years observing and recording the Red Planet."

      "author": "Sam",

    },
    {
      "author": "Michael Meyer",
      "text": "One of the distinctive things about Mars is that it\u2019s red so you can see it and identify it. It looks red because of rust \u2013 iron oxide on the surface, which is red and, interestingly that look can change. And we saw that in 2018 when there was a global dust storm \u2013 Mars, instead of looking red looked a little orange, and that changing of colour might have made the civilisations watching Mars maybe uneasy to see something immutable in our night sky changing colours."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Dr Meyer calls Mars\u2019s red colour distinctive - easy to recognise because it\u2019s different from everything else. But did you hear why it\u2019s red in the first place, Sam?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Yes - it\u2019s red because of rust - a reddish chemical substance called iron oxide that occurs when metals react with water and air."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The colour of this rust can change slightly, from red to brown to orange, and Dr Meyer thinks these changing colours may have worried ancient astronomers who believed Mars was immutable , or never changing."

      "author": "Sam",

      "author": "Michael Meyer",
      "text": "And from all that we have learned from astrobiology, life is amazingly adaptable , but it still needs water. So that\u2019s why water is the key. So, finding liquid water on Mars, whether or not it\u2019s now or whether or not it\u2019s in the past, tells you that you potentially have a habitable environment, some place that could support life and perhaps even Martian life."
