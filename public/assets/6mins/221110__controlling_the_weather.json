We\u2019ll learn the details soon but first I have a question for you about the wettest place in the world, a village which gets nearly twelve metres of rain a year. But where is it?

      "text": "The first type of weather manipulation we\u2019ll hear about is a way of getting snow and rain out of clouds known as \u2018cloud seeding\u2019. Airplanes fly through the clouds and spray chemicals to make water particles freeze and stick together as snowflakes. These then fall as snow which builds up during winter before melting in spring to help water crops."

This involves putting tiny particles called aerosols into the stratosphere - the band of sky twenty kilometres above the surface of the earth, about twice as high as airplanes fly."

People are, I think, sensibly scared that this could provide an excuse that allows countries or companies to avoid doing the work that has to be done to cut emissions. But in fact, controversy has really waxed and waned over time, so in the early work on climate change in the 1960s, and 70s and early 80s, these ideas were just part of the way we talked about what might happen about climate change. And then, as climate change became more politically central, say in the 90s and 2000s, there was really a taboo."
