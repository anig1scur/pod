Often this additional harm, things like the spread of diseases or destroyed roads and buildings, are worse than the disaster itself. Fortunately, ways to limit the damage are within our grasp . If something is within your grasp it is very likely that you will achieve it."

So in addition to having people on bicycles with megaphones going out and saying, \u2018Look a cyclone is coming, please get to shelter!\u2019, people in the danger zones have grown up accepting that their shelters will be safe, knowing where the evacuation routes are, but most importantly that they can return afterwards to their homes and to their livelihoods because they've built the infrastructure, and they've built their jobs in order to avoid being destroyed by the cyclone."
