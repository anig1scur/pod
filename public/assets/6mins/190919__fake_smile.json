  "intro": [
    "Sometimes it can be difficult to tell if someone is really smiling or the smirk on their face is fake. But now there are computers that are able tell real smiles from fake ones better than humans can. How do they work and what are the benefits? It's something Neil and Sam are discussing in 6 Minute English - as well as teaching you some useful vocabulary that will hopefully bring a smile to your face."
