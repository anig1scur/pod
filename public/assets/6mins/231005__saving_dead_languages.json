    "Before the arrival of European settlers, Australia was home to more than 200 languages. Many of these have died out since, but some have now been brought back to life. Barngala is one of these. Neil and Phil discuss the revival of Barngala and teach you some useful vocabulary."

      "text": "But first I have a question for you, Phil, and it\u2019s about a country which used to be one of the most linguistically rich places on Earth, Australia. Before European settlers arrived in the 1800s, Australia had over 200 languages spoken by the native Aboriginal people who had lived there for thousands of years. Many Aboriginal languages were destroyed by the brutal laws of the Australian government at the time, however some survived. So, which of the following Aboriginal languages is still spoken today?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Phil",
      "text": "Hmm, I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s Djinang."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Phil, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. The sad truth is that it was no accident that the Aboriginal languages died out, given the cruel treatment of Aboriginal people. Children were removed from their mothers and sent to schools thousands of miles away to learn English, and even today Aboriginal communities experience racism and poverty."

    {

      "text": "Another Aboriginal language, Barngarla, officially died in 1960 when its last native speaker, Elder Moonie Davis, passed away. But Barngarla has been brought back to life, and today it\u2019s spoken between parents and children, and even learned in school."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, how did a dead language with no living speakers come back to life? The unusual answer involves a dictionary and a professor of linguistics. Here\u2019s Professor Ghil\u2019ad Zuckermann telling his story for BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World."

    {
      "author": "Professor Ghil\u2019ad Zuckermann",
      "text": "I had a dictionary written by a German Lutheran Christian missionary in 1844. His name was Clamor Wilhelm Schumann, and he wrote the dictionary with up to 3500 words, which is a lot, because he wanted to Christianise the, in quotation marks, \u201cheathens\u201d . So, it\u2019s a topsy-turvy , righting the wrong of the past, by using a tool written for one goal in order to achieve the diametrically opposite goal."

    {
      "author": "Phil",
      "text": "Professor Zuckermann found an English-to-Barngala dictionary written in 1844 by a German missionary \u2013 a person sent to a foreign country to teach their religion to the people living there. Christian missionaries used the dictionary to teach English to what they called \"Aboriginal heathens \". Heathen is an old-fashioned word for someone who belongs to no religion, or to a religion that is not Christianity, Judaism, or Islam."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Professor Zuckermann puts the word \u201c heathen \u201d in quotation marks . The phrase ' in quotation marks' is used to show the actual words someone else has written or said, but here the phrase is used ironically. Professor Zuckermann is questioning the real meaning of the word \u201cheathens\u201d. He is signalling that he doesn\u2019t think Aboriginals are heathens at all, a bit like adding a wink at the end of a sentence so people know you\u2019re not serious."
    },
    {
      "author": "Phil",
      "text": "What\u2019s ironic is that Professor Zuckermann used the missionary\u2019s dictionary not to spread Christianity and English, but to save an Aboriginal language from extinction, so he calls it ' topsy-turvy' , meaning upside down."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
