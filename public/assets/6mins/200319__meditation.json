      "text": "When I first met His Holiness the Dalai Lama it was 1972. He challenged me, he said, \u2018I understand that you\u2019ve been using tools of modern neuroscience to study anxiety and depression. Why can\u2019t you use those same tools to study kindness and to study compassion?\u2019"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Neuroscience is the scientific study of the workings of the human brain and nervous system. Professor Davidson measured negative mental states like depression, in contrast to positive attitudes such as compassion \u2013 that\u2019s the wish for everyone to be free from suffering."

This is what you or I might experience as a flash of insight \u2013 a moment of sudden understanding and clarity. For us, it might last less than a second. But for these experienced Buddhist monks, the gamma waves lasted minutes! Furthermore, as Richard Davidson explains, brain changes as a result of meditation can be long lasting."

      "author": "Richard Davidson",
      "text": "There is no question at this point in time based upon the current science that has been conducted over the last 10 years, that meditation can change the brain in enduring ways; and the circuits that are involved are multiple, but they include circuits that are important for regulating attention and regulating emotion."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, this was proof of neuroplasticity \u2013 our brain\u2019s ability to change in response to conscious effort. In other words, the meditating monks were intentionally remoulding their minds in more positive ways!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "And this was possible because the brain circuits \u2013 different parts of the brain responsible for different functions \u2013 start talking to each other in new ways that created enduring \u2013 meaning long-lasting - changes."

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "By generating and sending out the compassionate wish, \u2018May all beings be happy\u2019, Buddhist meditators change their brain circuits \u2013 different parts of the brain responsible for different functions.
