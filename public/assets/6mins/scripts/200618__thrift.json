It\u2019s to do with living a simple life free from the need to constantly buy the latest products."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Today\u2019s consumer culture encourages us to \u2018spend, spend, spend\u2019, but it hasn\u2019t always been that way. The Victorians for example told people to \u2018save up for a rainy day\u2019, meaning to keep some money back in case of unforeseen emergencies."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before we discover more about that, it\u2019s time for today\u2019s quiz question. If you\u2019re trying to save money you probably know how hard it can be. So my question is: what percentage of people in the UK, do you think, have less than \u00a31000 in savings? Is it: a) 5%, b) 15 %, or c) 30%?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, if I\u2019m anything to go by I\u2019d say c) 30%."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, we\u2019ll find the correct answer out later. I mentioned before that \u2018thrift\u2019 is a difficult idea to define, so here\u2019s Alison Hulme, a lecturer at the University of Northampton, explaining more to BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme Thinking Allowed :"},{"author":"Alison Hulme","text":"There are two dictionary definitions of thrift. The older of the two comes from the word \u2018thrive\u2019 etymologically, and described thrift as the ability to live well and to flourish , so it\u2019s that sense of human flourishing. The more recent definition is the one we\u2019re probably more familiar with which is about frugality . All of that said, it\u2019s been used historically of course by various people in various moments in various different places in very different ways and they\u2019ve often had a social or religious agenda ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It seems the oldest definition of \u2018thrift\u2019 has nothing to do with saving money and is connected to the verbs \u2018thrive\u2019 and \u2018 flourish\u2019 -  meaning to grow or develop successfully."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It was only later with the Puritans - 16th century English Christians with a reputation for strict discipline - that the meaning of thrift changed and became associated with frugality - being careful not to spend too much money or eat too much food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The Puritans believed that being frugal was a religious virtue and that people ought to save money in order to give to others in need."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Later on the meaning of \u2018thrift\u2019 changed again. During the Victorian era, it was connected to the idea of managing your own money in order to be a responsible citizen."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Throughout history then, there have been different versions of \u2018thrift\u2019, and this may be because different religions or social groups had their own agenda - a specific aim or reason for a particular group to do something. For example, the Victorian definition of thrift was based on a social agenda about being a respectable member of society."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ideas about frugality and thrift changed again during the Second World War when the public was encouraged to avoid waste so that every material resource could go into the war effort."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And in the post-war period, it changed again as people\u2019s wealth and standard of living increased. Here\u2019s Alison Hulme again:"},{"author":"Alison Hulme","text":"It\u2019s the idea that once people had enough to meet their kind of basic needs there was this kind of moral slide into consumerism. It\u2019s not a view that I subscribe to in a simplistic sense myself - I think there\u2019s a very fine line to tread here. There\u2019s no point denying that, certainly in the developed world, there\u2019s been a rise in consumer capitalism, that\u2019s just a truism , but thrift hasn\u2019t declined."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In modern times, people\u2019s motivation to save up and be thrifty declined once they had enough to meet their basic needs - the basic necessities needed to survive, like food, clothes and shelter and nothing extra."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Alison mentions that once these basic needs were satisfied, people moved away from thrift into consumerism, the desire to buy \u2018luxury\u2019 products which were not absolutely necessary. According to some, this created a moral slide \u2013 a decrease in the standards of behaving in good, fair and honest ways."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The rise in consumer capitalism we have seen around the world is an example of a truism - something that is so obviously true it is not worth repeating."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What is worth repeating is the quiz question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you how many British people had savings of under \u00a31000."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said, c) 30%."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In fact, Sam, it\u2019s b) 15%."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So I guess I\u2019m not such a bad saver after all!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, today we\u2019ve been talking about the changing meanings of \u2018thrift\u2019, an idea connected to frugality - being careful not to spend too much money."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The original meaning of \u2018thrift\u2019 was to flourish - grow or develop successfully - but that definition changed as different religious groups, like the Puritans, promoted their own agenda - aim or reason for a particular group to do something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In recent times, people\u2019s ability to meet their basic needs \u2013 the necessities for survival like food and shelter, have reduced the importance of \u2018thrift\u2019, which some believe has created a moral slide \u2013 a reduction in standards of moral behaviour."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the associated rise of consumer capitalism is an example of a truism - something that is obviously true and generally accepted by all."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for now.
