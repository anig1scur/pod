We\u2019ll look at this topic a little more after this week\u2019s quiz question, which is about music videos. The music video has been around for a while, but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated music video channel, launched in the US? Was it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"What do you think, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m going to guess. Is it the early 1980s?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, yes. Care to be more specific?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well\u2026 Well, it was a long time ago \u2013 I was just a small boy. I'm going to go for 1982."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I\u2019ll have answer later in the programme. But first, more about sad songs. Professor David Huron from Ohio State University has conducted research in this area and he discussed it recently on a BBC World Service radio programme - The Why Factor. He was looking at why some people like sad music and other people really don\u2019t like it all, as he says they just can\u2019t stand it. He believes it\u2019s to do with a hormone . A hormone is a natural chemical in our bodies which can have an effect on various systems and also emotions. Listen out for the name of the hormone he mentions."},{"author":"Professor Huron","text":"One of the things that we were interested in was \u2018what\u2019s the difference between people who listen to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can\u2019t stand it'. In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin, as you might have guessed from the name, is associated with \u2018 lactation\u2019 from breast-feeding. When people cry, they also release prolactin. And, there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So which hormone did he mention?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"He talked about the hormone called prolactin which he said was connected to lactation . This is the production of milk by mammals to feed their young."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What he noted was that this hormone can be released when people cry and in some cases this hormone has a comforting effect. When something is comforting , it makes you feel better, it calms your emotions. Let\u2019s listen again."},{"author":"Professor Huron","text":"One of the things that we were interested in was \u2018what\u2019s the difference between people who listen to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can\u2019t stand it. In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin, as you might have guessed from the name, is associated with \u2018 lactation\u2019 from breast-feeding. When people cry, they also release prolactin. And, there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, what conclusions did he make about this hormone and how it might be working? Professor Huron explains."},{"author":"Professor Huron","text":"So the thought was that, perhaps what\u2019s going on is that the people who are enjoying listening to sad music are receiving some sort of excess of prolactin, and people who are listening to sad music and they just find it incredibly sad and unhelpful and they just don\u2019t want to listen to it, maybe they\u2019re not getting enough prolactin when they listen to the music."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So what is happening? Or as Professor Huron said, what\u2019s going on ?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, it seems quite simple, though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very complicated. People who like sad music are maybe getting too much prolactin or more than is normal \u2013 he describes this as an excess of prolactin. And maybe people who don\u2019t like sad music aren\u2019t getting enough."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, the idea is that prolactin is a hormone which we find comforting . If our bodies release it when we hear sad music, it gives us a good feeling \u2013 but if prolactin isn\u2019t released or there isn\u2019t enough of it, we just find the sad music sad and it doesn\u2019t help to cheer us up."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I guess so, but you know emotions are funny things - it\u2019s weird to think that our feelings are caused by different natural chemicals that run around the body. Absolutely! OK, we\u2019re going to take another look at today\u2019s vocabulary but first, the answer to this week\u2019s quiz. The music video has been around for a while, but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated music video channel, launched in the US? Was it\u2026"},{"author":"","text":"And Neil, you said\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said it was definitely the early 80s."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, you\u2019re not wrong there, but which year exactly?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201882?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah well, you\u2019ll need to dig out a sad song to make you feel better now because the answer was 1981."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, I can feel my prolactin levels dropping already!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t! But let\u2019s move on to vocabulary. If you can\u2019t stand something, it means you really don\u2019t like it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A hormone is one of the body\u2019s natural chemicals."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the hormone prolactin is connected with lactation , which is the production of milk by mammals."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Something that is comforting makes you feel better emotionally."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The phrase what\u2019s going on has a very similar meaning to 'what\u2019s happening'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And an excess of something is 'too much or a more than normal amount of that thing'."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, before you have an excess of our company, we should wrap up. Thanks for listening and we hope you\u2019ll join us again soon.
