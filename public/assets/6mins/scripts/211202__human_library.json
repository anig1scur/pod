This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you browse through a library, you\u2019ll find a variety of different books, from fiction to crime to romance."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And if you walk through a city you\u2019ll see a variety of people of different ages, body shapes, skin colours and genders."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this 6 Minute English, we\u2019ll be hearing about an unusual library where the books are people, made of flesh and bone instead of paper. It\u2019s called The Human Library and the \u2018books\u2019 are individuals who have faced prejudice \u2013 which means an unreasonable dislike of certain types of people."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Readers may borrow these \u2018books\u2019, who are people from all walks of life, for a thirty minute conversation. The book titles are short and to the point - titles like \u2018transgender\u2019, \u2018former criminal\u2019 or \u2018immigrant\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The human books are volunteers, and visiting readers are encouraged to ask those awkward or embarrassing questions they\u2019ve always wondered about."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This means the Human Library needs to be a safe space \u2013 a place where people feel protected from danger and harm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s a fascinating idea but before we find out more, I have a question for you, Sam. The Human Library started out in Denmark but soon spread across Europe and the world. So how many countries have a Human Library now? Is it: a)    75? b)    85?   or, c)    95?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, everyone likes to hear a story \u2013 so I\u2018ll guess, c) 95."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right later in the programme."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The first Human Library was founded in Copenhagen by Ronni Abergel. Here he is telling BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World about the inspiration behind his original idea:"},{"author":"Ronni Abergel","text":"We don\u2019t have time on the street to stop and get to know everyone, so we drop people in little boxes \u2026 so it\u2019s instinct that\u2019s guiding us, and we never get beyond the instinct if we don\u2019t get to know the person\u2026 so in our library, we recommend sitting down and meeting some of the people that you normally might actually not feel interested in sitting down with because there\u2019s something about them that you may feel a little bit uncomfortable about. You learn tremendously not only about them, but also about yourself."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When we meet someone new, we often already have ideas about what they are like. Ronni says we put someone in a box \u2013 an expression meaning to judge what kind of person someone is based on their appearance or on a limited understanding of who they are."},{"author":"Sam","text":"He recommends meeting people who you wouldn\u2019t usually spend time with, even if this makes you feel uncomfortable \u2013 feel slightly worried or embarrassed in a social situation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So the main idea of the Human Library is to challenge the assumptions and stereotypes that we all have about other people."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ronni uses social media to find volunteers who are willing to talk about their lives at public meetings, which anyone can attend."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As the Human Library spreads around the world, more money is needed to keep the project going. This mostly comes from hosting events for private companies, including famous businesses like Google."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Transgender volunteer Katy Jon Went is a regular host for the Human Library\u2019s business events. Listen to this clip of her introducing the project to a group of Dutch businessmen from BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World:"},{"author":"Katy Jon Went","text":"When we\u2019re in the workplace or on social media, what we often find is we\u2019re walking on eggshells around diversity and difference, and many people don\u2019t want to get it wrong, quite understandably. The important thing to remember is that you can ask them anything \u2013 they\u2019re never going to make to feel wrong for the question you ask today, which is an incredibly rare offer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When meeting someone with completely different life experiences, people can be worried about saying the wrong thing or asking embarrassing questions. Katy says they are walking on eggshells \u2013 an expression which means to be very careful about what you do and say because you don\u2019t want to offend or upset anyone."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But in fact the human \u2018books\u2019 are rarely offended. The event is all about celebrating people\u2019s difference and diversity \u2013 a term which describes how many different types of people are included together."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exactly. It\u2019s a celebration for everyone regardless of race, age or gender\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Or nationality\u2026 and that reminds me \u2013 what was the answer to your question, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes, I asked how many counties today have a Human Library. What did you say, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guessed it was c) 95 countries."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer I\u2019m afraid. The correct answer was b) 85 countries, from Norway and Hungary all the way to Australia and Mongolia!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Wow! I bet that makes a lot of interesting stories! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary for this programme about people sharing their experience of facing prejudice \u2013 the unreasonable dislike of certain groups of people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A safe space is place where you feel protected from danger and harm."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When we put someone in a box , we judge them based on their appearance or a limited understanding of them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you feel uncomfortable , you feel slightly worried or embarrassed in a social situation."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The expression walking on eggshells means being very careful about what you do and say because you don\u2019t want to offend anyone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, diversity is a term describing many different types of people being included together."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, it\u2019s time to return these human books back to the library shelves because our six minutes are up!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Join us again for more real-life stories and topical vocabulary here at 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
