This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you have a bank account, Beth, or, like my grandparents, do you keep your money under the mattress?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Sure, I have a bank account with one of the big high street banks."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, me too. But do you know exactly what your money\u2019s being used for? Is it helping fight climate change, or polluting the planet? Our money doesn\u2019t just sit there in the bank, it\u2019s invested to fund other businesses, some of which are far from environmentally friendly. So, do you know if your money is funding dirty practices like oil drilling?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"No, I don\u2019t. I have to admit I\u2019m very green about money, and I don\u2019t mean green as in environmentally friendly, I mean green as in ignorant or na\u00efve. In this programme, we\u2019ll be discussing ways in which our money can help protect the environment, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Great. But first I have a question for you, Beth. As the climate crisis worsens, people are making changes in their lives to help, for example by driving less or cycling more. One of the most effective things to do is be smart about investing your money, so according to the campaign, Make My Money Matter, which of the following is the best way to fight climate change? Is it:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s changing your pension."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. Concerns about how banks invest our money led to the UK\u2019s first environmentally sustainable bank, Triodos, which opened in Bristol in 2012. John Fleetwood, who has worked in sustainable investing for decades, thinks public interest in ethical banks has ballooned in the last few years, as he told BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth:"},{"author":"John Fleetwood","text":"It was always viewed, I think, as a niche thing, something for those that had very clear views on the world, social views. That\u2019s now broadened hugely, and there\u2019s great concern about greenwashing so who\u2019s jumping on the bandwagon ? - that\u2019s a huge concern amongst investors. So, what I\u2019m doing is to tackle that and actually to say, okay, which are the funds that are actually making a positive social and environmental impact?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Ethical banks used to be considered niche, interesting or appealing only to a small number of people. But as environmentally responsible investing increased, banks started jumping on the bandwagon , an idiom meaning to become involved in an activity because it\u2019s popular, and not because you\u2019re really interested in it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As a result, some banks have been accused of greenwashing, attempting to appear environmentally friendly without actually doing anything serious to protect the environment."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But remember, banks rely on customers\u2019 money, and are likely to change their behaviour when customers threaten to take their money elsewhere. This idea inspired British film director, Richard Curtis, to start his campaign, Make My Money Matter. On TV, Richard has raised millions of pounds for the BBC\u2019s charity, Comic Relief, but even he was surprised by the amount of money saved by doing one simple thing, moving your pension to an environmentally sustainable fund. And as Richard told BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth, he was even encouraged by former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney:"},{"author":"Richard Curtis","text":"You know, when I started this everyone said, well you know all the mechanisms and all the accounting and all the transparency isn't quite there yet, but Mark Carney said to me, \u2018Go for it!\u2019 because it will be\u2026 the more that people become interested, the more transparent companies will have to be, the more examples they'll give you of good things that you're investing in\u2026 so that, as it were, it will get better the more the spotlight is put on exactly what an ethical or sustainable pension is doing."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The more people demand responsible pensions, the more banks need to be transparent, meaning open and honest, about their investments."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This in turn puts the spotlight on how pension funds are being used, for example whether they support large oil corporations or renewable energy companies. To put the spotlight on something means to attract attention to it, usually to share information about something bad. Luckily, the customer is always right, and by managing our money ethically, we can all help a little."},{"author":"Beth","text":"I think it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question about the most effective way to fight climate change, Neil. I said it was by moving your pension into ethical investments."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was... the correct answer! In fact, changing your pension is thought to be twenty-one times more effective than avoiding meat and stopping flying put together. OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme, starting with green, an adjective with several meanings, one of which is na\u00efve or inexperienced."},{"author":"Beth","text":"A niche interest appeals only to a small number of people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Greenwashing describes attempts by a business to seem more environmentally friendly than they really are."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The idiom jump on the bandwagon , means become involved in an activity because it is popular and likely to succeed, not because you are really interested in it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When a business is transparent, it\u2019s easy to see how it works because it is open and honest, without hidden secrets."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, the phrase to put the spotlight on something , means to draw attention to it. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English! Bye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","John Fleetwood","Richard
