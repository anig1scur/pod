This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sorry I was late today, Georgina. I\u2019d forgotten to take the recycling bins out before the rubbish collection this morning. I seem to have more and more plastic packaging each week! Actually, that\u2019s the topic of our programme. With more and more household waste being either incinerated \u2013 that\u2019s burned - or being buried underground, we\u2019ll be asking - is the recycling system broken?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"China used to accept 55% of the world\u2019s plastic and paper scrap \u2013 another word for unwanted waste - or in other words, rubbish. That included waste sent over from Britain. But in 2018 it stopped taking any more."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Other countries like Indonesia and Vietnam took over China\u2019s waste processing role. But they too are now sending much of the scrap back, arguing it is contaminated and it is harming their own environments."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"This has created major problems for countries in the West who traditionally relied on others to process their recycling waste."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the problem isn\u2019t going away. In fact we are creating more household waste than ever. So here\u2019s my quiz question. On average, how many kilograms of household waste were generated per person in the UK last year? Was it: a) 280 kg b) 480 kg c) 680 kg"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That sounds like a lot of waste! I\u2019ll say a) 280 kg."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. We\u2019ll find out later if you were right. Although nowadays people are recycling more, the use of plastic isn\u2019t decreasing at the same rate. The BBC World Service\u2019s programme The Inquiry spoke to Roland Geyer, a professor at the University of California about the current situation."},{"author":"Professor Roland Geyer","text":"There\u2019s been a real raise in consciousness which is fantastic and I\u2019m really glad that now it seems the public at large is really interested in this issue and appalled and wants to do something about it, wants to change it. But at the same time I don\u2019t see yet any real action that would make things better because while all of this is happening the virgin plastic industry is actually increasing its production capacity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Workers who process recycling are often exposed to dangerous waste materials which can harm them. Professor Geyer says there has been a raise in consciousness about this problem \u2013 meaning that people are being told about an unfair situation with the aim of asking them to help change it. Now, professor Geyer is an American and he uses 'raise' as a noun."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The main problem comes from virgin plastic - original, unused plastic containers. These are  made directly from fossil fuels like crude oil or natural gas - major sources of carbon dioxide and climate change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But consciousness raising of this issue is having an impact. The public at large \u2013 meaning most people in the world, rather than just some of them \u2013 are concerned about the increase in plastic waste and want to do something to help."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"However, it\u2019s not always easy to know what the best way to help is."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Another expert, Professor Monic Sun, believes that focusing only on recycling may not be the best idea. She conducted psychological experiments to find out more about peoples\u2019 attitudes to recycling\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"..and surprisingly found that if people know recycling is an option they tend to use more resources. They reduce any guilty feelings by telling themselves that the material will be recycled anyway."},{"author":"Professor Monic Sun ","text":"We have the slogan of \u2018Reduce, Reuse and Recycle\u2019 and the priority should be exactly that \u2013 reduce and reuse is better than recycling. And the cost of recycling is often not emphasised enough. People perceive recycling to be great but there\u2019s actually significant labour and material costs associated with recycling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Sun mentions \u2018Reduce, Reuse and Recycle\u2019 as a useful slogan - ashort, easily remembered phrase, often used to promote an idea, in this case that we should all do what we can to protect the environment."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But while protecting the planet is a common goal, recycling in itself may not be so important. It\u2019s better to reduce and reuse than recycle, so these two objectives should be emphasised - highlighted as being especially important."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you remember my quiz question? I asked you how many kilograms of waste the average British person generated last year."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I reckoned it was a) 280 kg."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That would be bad enough, but the real answer is b) 480 kg. Multiply that by the UK population of 66 million and you start to see the size of the problem!"},{"author":"scrap","text":"Today we\u2019ve been talking about the problems associated with recycling  \u2013 another word for rubbish."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Western countries used to send their rubbish to China for recycling but this caused issues for the local environment. Some groups raised consciousness about the problem \u2013 made people aware of the situation to encourage them to help change it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The public at large \u2013 most people in the world \u2013 are now aware of the need to \u2018Reduce, Reuse and Recycle\u2019, the slogan \u2013 or short, memorable phrase \u2013 used by environmentalists to spread their message."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A related problem is the increase of virgin plastic \u2013 original, unused plastic made from fossil fuels. Recycling is unable to keep pace with virgin plastic production, so instead reducing and reusing plastic should be emphasised - highlighted as being especially important."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s all from us.
