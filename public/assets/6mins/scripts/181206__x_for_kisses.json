The letter is X."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. Exactly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Alright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let\u2019s have a question. English has 26 letters.

Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from?

And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And this has got nothing to do with a penny , which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk . That\u2019s more like the noise two heavy metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s listen to that exchange again."},{"author":"Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge","text":"Well, we\u2019ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763.

It\u2019s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn\u2019t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?"},{"author":"Professor Nils Langer, University of Bristol","text":"A colleague of mine from Bristol, who... when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue.

So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue , which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We don\u2019t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid . To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Time now for the answer to our question.

The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We started with a penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The phrase, the penny has dropped , means that someone has suddenly understood something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The Inland Revenue is the UK\u2019s tax authority."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, a quid , which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it\u2019s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com.
