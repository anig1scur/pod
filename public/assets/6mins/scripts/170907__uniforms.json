Why are you wearing a policeman\u2019s hat, Tim?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"To get me in the mood for our topic today \u2013 uniforms!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, the hat certainly suits you!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"And if something suits you it looks good on you! Well, thanks, Neil. And funnily enough, I have a question for you on the subject of police hats! In the 19th century, police officers' top hats could be used\u2026 a) to stand on, b) as a weapon or c) to protect their heads from the sun?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, they're kind of pointy so I\u2019m going to say as a weapon."},{"author":"Tim","text":"OK. Let\u2019s consider what the point of a uniform is. Why do some jobs have them while others don\u2019t?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well \u2013 The police, and other emergency services, like the fire brigade, and ambulance service \u2013 they need practical clothes to help them do their job."},{"author":"Tim","text":"People need to recognize them too, don\u2019t they?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s right. A uniform makes people stand out from crowd."},{"author":"Tim","text":"If something stands out it\u2019s noticeable or easy to see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But uniform also allows you to fit in \u2013 it shows you belong to a particular group or organization \u2013 and people often enjoy that sense of community at work."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Do you think we should get some 6 Minute English T-shirts made, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we share a sense of community without team T-shirts, Tim. Let\u2019s listen to cultural historian, Joe Moran, talking about why wearing a uniform can also allow you to behave differently to the way you normally behave."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Joe Moran, cultural historian It\u2019s a role and a genre that you adopt and it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s not quite you. It\u2019s kind of a persona that you can put on. In Germany they call it \u2018maskenfreiheit\u2019, which is the freedom conferred by masks. There\u2019s something about taking on what is very clearly a persona or professional role, that can be liberating, I think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So when you put on a uniform you are adopting a role or genre. Genre means a particular style. And a persona is a character you present to the outside world \u2013 as opposed to the person you feel like inside."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Joe Moran compares putting on a persona to putting on a mask. And he says this can be very liberating . But do you really think putting on a uniform liberates \u2013 or frees \u2013 us from the person we really are?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe. If you\u2019re shy, for example, a uniform might feel liberating because it allows you to behave more confidently. So, if you could choose a uniform and a new persona, what would it be, Tim?"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Hmm. An airline pilot, I think. I\u2019d look great in a blazer with brass buttons \u2013 and with the cap and mirror sunglasses. Hello, this is your captain speaking. We\u2019ll shortly be arriving at LAX airport in sunny Los Angeles. Local time is 12.55 and it\u2019s hot hot hot outside, so I hope you\u2019ve packed plenty of sun cream."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Tim, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! I can see you\u2019d love being a pilot \u2013 or at least you\u2019d love talking to your passengers!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"What about you, Neil? What would you like to try on for size? A surgeon\u2019s scrubs? A nun\u2019s habit?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"To try something on for size means to decide whether it\u2019s what you want or not. No Tim\u2026 I\u2019d go for a chef\u2019s apron, checked trousers, a tall hat."},{"author":"Tim","text":"I think the uniform would suit you, but are you good at cooking, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m an excellent cook. Now, I think we should have the answer to today\u2019s quiz question, Tim."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Yes, I asked what a police officer\u2019s hat could be used for in the 19th century."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said as a weapon."},{"author":"Tim","text":"Wrong, I\u2019m afraid. From 1829 to 1839, Metropolitan Police officers wore a cane-reinforced top hat, which could be used as a step to climb or see over walls. I wonder if modern police hats are strong enough to stand on?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"We\u2019ll try yours later and find out. But now let\u2019s go over the other key words we learned today."},{"author":"Tim","text":"OK. If something \u2018suits you\u2019, it looks good on you. For example, \u201cDoes this pilot\u2019s uniform suit me, Neil?\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It suits you down to the ground, Tim! And that means it suits you very well!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Number two \u2013 If something \u2018stands out\u2019, it\u2019s noticeable or easy to see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cMy colourful suit really stood out at the party.\u201d"},{"author":"Tim","text":"In a good way, I hope! OK, next item \u2013 \u2018to fit in\u2019 \u2013 means you belong to a particular group and are accepted by them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cI never fitted in with the cool kids at school.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Tim! Maybe you weren\u2019t wearing the right uniform? Number four is \u2018persona\u2019 \u2013 the character you present to the outside world \u2013 as opposed to the person you feel like inside."},{"author":"Tim","text":"\u201cMy work persona is confident and chatty but I\u2019m actually rather shy.\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m learning a lot about you today, Tim!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"They\u2019re just examples, Neil. I don\u2019t have a work persona \u2013 that\u2019s the nice thing about our job \u2013 there\u2019s no need to put on masks or personas."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Just the occasional hat\u2026"},{"author":"Tim","text":"Indeed. And a very nice hat this is too \u2013 I think I\u2019ll keep it. Now, let\u2019s finish the vocabulary! Number five \u2013 \u2018liberating\u2019 means feeling you can behave however you like."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For example, \u201cTalking openly about your problems can be very liberating.\u201d Tim And finally, \u2018to try something on for size\u2019 means to test something to decide whether you want it or not."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Our listeners can try these new vocabulary items on for size and decide whether they\u2019ll be useful or not!"},{"author":"Tim","text":"And if not, then please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us what you think!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!
