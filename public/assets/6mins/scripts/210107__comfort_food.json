You can\u2019t beat a bite on a biscuit for a quick and easy sweet treat. They make me feel good \u2013 as long as I don\u2019t eat too many!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, these are your \u2018edible comforters\u2019 \u2013 a comforter is something that makes you feel relaxed and feel good. Put another way, it is your comfort food, which is what we\u2019re talking about in this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, like biscuits \u2013 comfort food is snacks and meals we like to stuff our faces with, even if it\u2019s not always good for us. We\u2019ll be discussing what actually makes us eat the stuff."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But how about a question to feast on, Rob? Patrick Bertoletti from the USA holds the Guinness World Record for eating the most cream-filled biscuits in one minute, but do you know how many biscuits he ate? Was it\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, based on my biscuit-eating skills, I\u2019d say 15 \u2013 it depends if he had to swallow them all as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m not sure about that \u2013 but I\u2019ll reveal the answer later on. Now, biscuits, ice cream, crisps and pizzas are all good examples of comfort food. They\u2019re easy to snack on and they don\u2019t require many culinary skills \u2013 culinary means related to cooking."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Umm, well that makes sense, but there must be something else that is urging us to seek out this \u2018easy\u2019 food?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to psychologist Shira Gabriel, it\u2019s about memories and emotional experiences. She spoke on The Food Chain podcast on BBC World Service and said her comfort food was macaroni and cheese \u2013 something that brings back memories\u2026"},{"author":"Shira Gabriel, psychologist","text":"At some point in my life those were foods that were made for me or shared with me by people who cared about me and loved me and took care of me, so because those are the foods that I had in my youth, I\u2019ve associated with them, sort of, those feelings of being taken care of. And those associations are strong, the associations we have with food are very strong, and so by eating those foods, I\u2019m able to activate those associations and give myself a rush of positive feelings and a sense of acceptance."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026 so like so many of us, Shira associates eating certain types of food with past experiences from her youth. Associates means makes a connection in your mind with something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And these connections between food and memories are very strong. I know eating biscuits reminds me of eating them after school, as a treat."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Shira explains how we get a rush \u2013 a sudden and strong emotion \u2013 of positive feelings when these memories are activated by eating comfort food."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And it\u2019s not just memories that are activated, but also the emotions we feel as well. If we felt happy the first time we ate the food, then hopefully we\u2019ll feel happy when we eat it again."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s not always that simple, Rob. Tucking into food that\u2019s high in carbohydrates, sugar or salt can make us feel guilty, but we don\u2019t realise our minds are trying to trigger \u2013 or start - a positive emotion, and it\u2019s making us eat that food to do so."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The Food Chain podcast explores this in more detail \u2013 but what is interesting is that comfort food isn\u2019t universal. Some languages don\u2019t have a comparable phrase."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s a good point and something food writer Jenny Linford talked about. Here\u2019s her theory on why that is\u2026"},{"author":"Jenny Linford, food writer","text":"Talking to Italian friends, I realised that, no, they don\u2019t have a phrase for \u2018comfort food\u2019 \u2013 I think it\u2019s sort of irrelevant \u2026. My Italian friends I asked about comfort food, they were just, they said to me, look you know, food is always comfort and always pleasure and it\u2019s a joyful thing, so it\u2019s just really interesting that you know this idea of comfort food is not universal, it\u2019s actually quite nuanced ."},{"author":"irrelevant","text":"Rob So, according to Jenny\u2019s Italian friends, all food brings comfort and pleasure. Talking about specific comforting food is  \u2013 it is not important or has no connection with the discussion."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, she thinks the concept of comfort food is quite nuanced , depending on where you are from \u2013 so there are small but important differences."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, maybe we should take comfort from - or feel less bad about \u2013 the fact that eating any kind of food can bring us joy, warmth, happiness and comfort. So if you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019ll munch on another biscuit."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Are you trying to beat the record of Patrick Bertoletti from the USA? Earlier I mentioned he holds the Guinness World Record for eating the most cream-filled biscuits in one minute, but how many biscuits did he eat? Was it\u2026 a) 2 b) 7, or c) 15?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I thought he ate 15. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, Rob. He scoffed only 7 in one minute. So maybe you can beat him? But before you do, let\u2019s recap on some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve been discussing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Of course. We\u2019ve been talking about comfort food \u2013 food that makes us feel good \u2013 and we described it as a \u2018 comforter\u2019 - something that makes us feel relaxed and feel good."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We also mentioned culinary \u2013 connected to cooking."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And associated \u2013 which means made a connection in our mind with something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Something that is irrelevant is not important or has no connection with the discussion taking place."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And something that is nuanced has small but important differences."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Finally, when you take comfort in something, you don\u2019t feel so bad because of something else."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Neil, we\u2019re out of time but let\u2019s take comfort in knowing that there are lots more 6 Minute English programmes to enjoy on our website at bbclearningenglish.com."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We also have an app that you can download for free from the app stores.
