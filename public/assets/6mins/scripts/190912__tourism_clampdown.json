Well, joining me to do this is Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hello! So what\u2019s our interesting topic today, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Something close to our hearts, Sam \u2013 it's travel."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Great!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"But more and more of us are travelling to explore the world \u2013 many of us have more leisure time, and the cost of travelling has become relatively cheaper."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But here lies the problem \u2013 the places we\u2019re visiting are becoming more crowded, sometimes spoiling the atmosphere and the beauty \u2013 the things we came to see in the first place!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"This is why we\u2019re going to be discussing how some cities around the world are putting restrictions on the tourists who visit. But that\u2019s after I challenge you to answer this question, Sam! Are you ready?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bring it on, Rob!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"According to Mastercard\u2019s Global Destination Cities Index, what was the most visited city in 2018? Was it\u2026 a) London b) New York, or c) Bangkok?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"All great places to visit \u2013 but I think I\u2019ll stay close to home and say a) London."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. Well, as always I will reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, let\u2019s start our journey in Italy\u2019s capital city, Rome. Famous for its Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and many other things."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Lots of people are visiting, Rob \u2013 and locals and tourists have differing attitudes towards the way they respect these beautiful and historic sites. Respect here is a verb, to mean treat something with care."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, the authorities in the city fear that some tourists are showing disrespect to the city and have introduced laws to clampdown on certain behaviour. Clampdown means officially trying to stop or limit people doing something. Sabina Castelfranco is a journalist in the city. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours programme why new restrictions have been introduced\u2026"},{"author":"Sabina Castelfranco, journalist","text":"The new rules are really to make sure that tourists do not misbehave when they are visiting tourist attractions in Rome. Romans don't like to see tourists walking around bare-chested, they don't like to see them wading in their fountains - so really the objective is to improve the life of the city for residents and for tourists themselves."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, the new rules are to stop tourists misbehaving \u2013 that\u2019s doing bad or inappropriate things. I\u2019m sure not all visitors misbehave \u2013 but those who have been, have been wading \u2013 that\u2019s walking through water \u2013 in the famous fountains and men have not been covering up the top half of their bodies \u2013 so, going bare-chested."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Not any more, Sam! These new laws have banned this with the objective of improving the life for the people of Rome \u2013 the Romans. An objective is a plan or aim to achieve something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Other laws introduced in Rome, with the objective of improving the city, include giving out severe fines to people who drop litter and to those who attach \u2018love padlocks\u2019 to historic monuments."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I guess if it makes the city a nicer place to visit for everyone, then it\u2019s a good idea.  Well, let\u2019s talk about another historic old city \u2013 Bruges in Belgium. The old and narrow streets are often packed with sightseers \u2013 so restrictions have been introduced there. Helen Coffey, deputy travel editor for the Independent newspaper, also spoke to the You and Yours programme, to explain what is going on\u2026"},{"author":"Helen Coffey, Deputy Travel Editor, The Independent","text":"Bruges was the latest city to say we're going to introduce new regulations to crack down on what they called the Disneyfication of their city. A really key one is they're going to cap the number of cruises that can dock, and actually this a big one that lots of cities do. They basically don't like cruise visitors because cruise visitors don't spend money."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So Helen mentioned a crackdown \u2013 which like clampdown \u2013 means taking action to restrict or stop certain activities. And Bruges wants to crack down on the Disneyfication of the city."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This term describes turning something into an artificial, not real, commercial environment, similar to a Walt Disney theme park. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that similar yet, but one way to maintain the authentic feel of the city is to cap the number of cruises that can dock."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Cap means restrict or limit. It\u2019s felt that visitors who come by cruise ship, don\u2019t stay overnight and therefore don\u2019t bring much money into the city. The message from the city authorities is \u2018stay overnight or don\u2019t come!\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, one city that has people visiting for the day or staying longer is the most visited city in the world \u2013 but where is that, Sam? Earlier I asked you what the most visited city in 2018 was? Was it\u2026 a) London b) New York, or c) Bangkok?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said London."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That was in second place. The most visited city last year was Bangkok, in Thailand."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Rob. Well, maybe what I can get right is a recap of today\u2019s vocabulary. Starting with respect . If you respect something you treat it with care."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We also discussed clampdown , which means officially trying to stop or limit people doing something. Crackdown is a similar phrase."},{"author":"Sam","text":"To misbehave is to do something bad or inappropriate. And an objective is a plan or aim to achieve something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Our next word is Disneyfication - a term that describes turning something into an artificial, not real, commercial environment, similar to a Walt Disney theme park."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally we had cap \u2013 which means restrict or limit."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, we\u2019ve had to cap this programme at 6 minutes \u2013 and we\u2019re out of time. Goodbye!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bye bye!"}],"authors":["","Rob","Sam","Sabina Castelfranco, journalist","Helen Coffey, Deputy Travel Editor, The
