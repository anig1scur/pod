Doesn\u2019t it mean that people often feel better after talking about their problems with someone?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right - in this programme we\u2019ll be hearing the extraordinary story of how these ideas were taken up by a team of community grandmothers in Zimbabwe."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Zimbabwe has over 14 million people but fewer than 20 psychiatrists.

Now, although the recent history of Zimbabwe has left millions struggling with mental health issues, at the start of his project, Dr Dixon Chibanda was the only psychiatrist working in public health in the whole country."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And as well as a lack of provision, many villagers were suspicious of talking therapy, preferring to rely on traditional faith healers instead."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is why when Kim Chakanetsa, of BBC World Service\u2019s The Documentary Podcast , spoke to Dr Dixon Chibanda, she started by asking him whether people were supportive of his idea:"},{"author":"Dr Dixon Chibanda","text":"Initially there was a lot of scepticism , a lot of resistance, particularly from colleagues who thought this was not evidence-based, and it wasn\u2019t going to work. The whole idea of training grandmothers \u2013 I mean, this has not been done anywhere else in the world so naturally there was resistance ."},{"author":"Kim Chakanetsa","text":"Were you at all apprehensive ?"},{"author":"Dr Dixon Chibanda","text":"I was, to be quite honest."},{"author":"Sam","text":"At first, Dr Dixon Chibanda\u2019s ideas were met with scepticism \u2013 an attitude of doubting whether something is useful or true."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Grandma benches\u2019 were a totally new idea, never seen before anywhere in the world and so his colleagues naturally felt some resistance - refusal to accept a change or new idea."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which left Dr Dixon Chibanda feeling a little apprehensive \u2013 worried that something bad was going to happen to his project."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Fortunately, as it turned out, Dr Dixon Chibanda\u2019s apprehensions were wrong. Grandmothers are highly respected in Zimbabwean society and as they started listening, people began opening up and telling their stories."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The \u2018grandma benches\u2019 have empowered over 50,000 people to deal with their life problems and Dr Dixon Chibanda even has plans to move his idea online, giving the world access to a virtual Friendship Bench."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here he is again, explaining on the BBC World Service\u2019s The Documentary Podcast why he believes his ideas have been so successful:"},{"author":"Dr Dixon Chibanda","text":"It works because it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s run by communities, particularly grandmothers who are in essence a resource in African communities \u2013 you know, they are the custodians of local culture and wisdom \u2013 that\u2019s why is works, and I guess, it does away with western concepts which remove the stigma that is normally associated with mental illness."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Clients are willing to share their problems with the grandmother-therapists because they are respected as cultural custodians \u2013 people with responsibility for taking care of something or trying to protect ideas or principles, in this case local customs and wisdom."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This helps do away with \u2013 or remove \u2013 the stigma attached to mental health \u2013 strong feelings of shame or disapproval which most members of a community have towards something, such as psychological illness."},{"author":"Sam","text":"For Zimbabweans suffering domestic violence, unemployment and dealing with HIV, having a grandmother to talk to really can change their perceptions about how problems can be managed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So it seems true that \u2018a problem shared is a problem halved\u2019, which reminds me of our quiz question, Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes. You asked me what the talking therapy abbreviated to CBT stands for. And I said c) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is absolutely right! CBT \u2013 a way of managing problems by changing ways of thinking and behaving."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So this week we\u2019ve been hearing the inspiring story of Zimbabwean Dr Dixon Chibanda\u2019s \u2018grandma bench\u2019 therapy -  an idea which was initially met with scepticism \u2013 a doubtful attitude, and resistance \u2013 refusal to change and accept new ideas."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Dixon Chibanda\u2019s feelings of apprehension \u2013 worries that the project would fail, proved false when his team of grandmother therapists were treated as custodians \u2013 or protectors, of wisdom and life experience who really could help people suffering depression, poverty and trauma."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The success of the project helped do away with \u2013 or remove \u2013 strong feelings of shame or disapproval felt by many people regarding mental health, known as stigma.
