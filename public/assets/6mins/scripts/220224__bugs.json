This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you like trying new food?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I do indeed \u2013 I love eating foods from around the world and I especially like trying out restaurants that serve news kinds of food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Me too, and I like food that is a mix of different styles \u2013 sometimes called fusion food. But could I tempt you to some insect tapas or a tarantula doughnut?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Maybe not \u2013 the idea of eating food made from bugs and creepy crawlies doesn\u2019t appeal."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, maybe I can convince you in this programme because that\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing \u2013 and teaching you some vocabulary along the way. But first, I must serve you a question to answer. It\u2019s about food \u2013 but not made form bugs. Do you know what type of food is sometimes known as \u2018priest chokers\u2019? Is it: a)    cheese? b)    pasta? or c)    potato?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think I know this one, Neil. It\u2019s pasta, isn\u2019t it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I will give you the answer at the end of the programme. But, let\u2019s get back to food made from bugs \u2013 which is a growing trend in the Western world.  Insects are an alternative source of food and experts say they\u2019re filled with lots of good nutrients, including amino acids and protein. And eating them could help to fight world hunger and reduce pollution."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m not convinced yet, but I do know that the word for eating insects is \u2018 entomophagy\u2019 and it\u2019s something BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, discussed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The programme spoke to experts who think cooking with bugs is a great idea. One of them was Andy Holcroft, founding director of Grub Kitchen and Bug Farm Foods. He explained the challenge of getting some people to eat bugs\u2026"},{"author":"Andy Holcroft, founding director of Grub Kitchen and Bug Farm Foods","text":"In the Western culture, we have got a bit of an uphill \u2013 I would say - struggle because pre-conceptions around eating insects are already sort of ingrained in society, so we already think before we've even tried them, they're going to taste disgusting or gross. So, to actually get someone to put it in your mouth - the easiest way we find straightaway is to try maybe, a cricket cookie or a chocolate-chip cricket cookie where you have\u2026 we are using cricket powder so you don\u2019t actually see any insects whatsoever \u2013 you\u2019re getting the idea of eating them so people can deal with that a bit more than actually seeing the whole insect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Interestingly, it seems to be western cultures that don\u2019t like eating insects \u2013 perhaps because it\u2019s thought to be wrong or just disgusting, even if it\u2019s not! As Andy says, people have pre-conceived ideas about it. To change these ideas is an uphill struggle or needs a lot of effort to achieve."},{"author":"","text":"Sam Yes, the negative attitude to eating bugs is ingrained into society, meaning it is a long-lasting attitude that is difficult to change. But Andy and other chefs are trying to change that attitude by subtly introducing insects into food, such as his chocolate-chip cricket cookies."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This is just for starters! Other interesting and exotic dishes, where you do see the bugs you\u2019re eating, are now being served."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m still not convinced but maybe chef Joseph Yoon can change my mind? He is a chef and an \u2018edible insect ambassador\u2019. He\u2019s also trying to persuade the squeamish \u2013 people easily upset by something unpleasant - to overcome their fears of crickets, worms, and spiders, and instead see them as a tasty, alternative source of protein."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here he is, speaking on the BBC\u2019s Food Chain programme talking about changing people\u2019s attitudes."},{"author":"Joseph Yoon, chef and executive director of Brooklyn Bugs","text":"We approach our work with openness, with understanding and inclusivity. When people approach me and they go like \u2018urghh\u2019 or they react very viscerally , I don\u2019t get confrontational, I go like, I understand that you can feel that way and what we need to do is start changing these perceptions from insects as being a pest, that bites you or that carries disease, to edible insects, something that\u2019s sustainably farmed and harvested specifically for human consumption."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, Joseph is passionate about edible insects but is understanding of people who don\u2019t like the idea and maybe show this viscerally - having an emotional reaction rather than one based on fact or reason."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But Joseph wants to change these negative emotions by explaining the insects are farmed purely for humans to eat, and they are farmed sustainably \u2013 in a way that can last for a long time and is good for the environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I suppose we kill animals such as cows and sheep to eat so why not insects or spiders? The debate about this continues but there\u2019s no debate about the answer to today\u2019s question, Sam. Earlier, I asked you if you knew what type of food is sometimes known as \u2018priest choker\u2019?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I was sure if was pasta."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It is pasta. Strozzapreti, which means \u2018priest chokers\u2019 in Italian, is an elongated form of cavatelli pasta. Its name is thought to come from the greedy priests who were so enthralled by the pasta that they ate too quickly and choked themselves. No bugs were involved, though."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s good to know because we have been talking about entomophagy , a word for the practice of eating insects."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Other vocabulary we mentioned included fusion , which means a mix of different styles. And the expression an uphill struggle means needs a lot of effort to achieve."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Something that is ingrained is a long-lasting attitude that is difficult to change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Viscerally describes having an emotional reaction rather than one based on fact or reason."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And, doing something sustainably is doing it in a way that can last for a long time and is good for the environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s all for this 6 Minute English.
