But in decades after that famous event, interest in returning to the Moon faded away... until now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Summer 2023 saw the start of a new race for the Moon between Russia\u2019s Luna-25 spacecraft and India\u2019s Chandrayaan-3. Russia\u2019s rocket crashed on landing, but Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down on the 23rd of August, making India only the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"But why this sudden interest in going back to the Moon? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be discussing in this programme and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before we blast off, I have a question for you, Georgie. Everyone knows that Neil Armstrong was the first man on the Moon, and was followed by a second astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. But who was the third Apollo astronaut who flew the command module while his crewmates walked on the Moon? Was it:"},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Hmm, I think it was Michael Collins."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Okay, Georgie, we\u2019ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. In some ways, the current interest in the Moon is really more about the origins of Earth. One theory is that during the early days of the solar system, around 4 billion years ago, another planet crashed into Earth breaking off a part which then formed the Moon. Unlike the Earth\u2019s surface, which is constantly moving, the Moon is completely still, frozen in time to create a perfectly preserved record of what happened at the birth of the solar system. Here\u2019s astronomer, Dr Becky Smethurst, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science:"},{"author":"Dr Becky Smethurst","text":"\u2026Whereas on the Moon, it\u2019s just this inert rock, there's no atmosphere so every single thing that's happened to the Moon in its four-and-a-half billion years\u2019 worth history is still recorded there on it.  And so, if anyone's ever seen an image of the far side of the Moon, the side of the Moon that we cannot see from Earth is incredibly pockmarked . There are craters all over that thing, and so this is a really big deal when we're thinking about what happened to the early Earth as well, because we think all of the Earth's water came from impacts with comets and asteroids in the very early days of the solar system."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"The rock which makes up the Moon is inert \u2013 it doesn\u2019t move. It\u2019s also full of craters - large holes in the ground caused by something hitting it. The Moon has so many of these craters, it\u2019s described as pockmarked \u2013 having a surface that\u2019s covered in small marks and scars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"These craters play an important part in the story. Because the Moon\u2019s surface does not change, finding water there would explain a lot about how water, and therefore life, started on Earth. That\u2019s why Dr Smethurst calls the Moon mission a big deal , meaning important or significant."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"That\u2019s right. Astronomers know that comets are full of ice, and think comets brought water to Earth when they crashed into it. Evidence of those crashes has been erased by the constantly moving surfaces on Earth, but not on the Moon. So, comparing water from the Moon with water on Earth could provide scientists with vital information, as Dr Smethurst explained to BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Inside Science:"},{"author":"Dr Becky Smethurst","text":"So they'll be looking essentially to see if it has the same characteristics as water here on Earth, and then we can sort of trace that back from sort of the crater history as well to working out what actually happened. How long has it been there for as well. Also, various other minerals that might be there, these very heavy minerals that we know come from comets and asteroids. Again, that would be this sort of smoking gun to be like, yes this that's where this water came from and it's likely that Earth\u2019s water came from there as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Scientists can trace the existence of water on the Moon back to find out what happened on Earth. If you trace something back, you discover the causes of something by investigating how it developed."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"For this reason, Dr Smethurst says finding water on the Moon would be finding a smoking gun , a modern idiom meaning indisputable evidence or proof. We\u2019ve learned a lot about the Moon, but we still don\u2019t know the answer to your question, Neil - who was the third Apollo astronaut on that famous first landing in 1969? I said it was Michael Collins\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Michael Collins never set foot on the Moon himself, but afterwards said the experience of looking back at Earth from the Apollo spacecraft changed his life forever. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from our trip to the Moon, starting with inert , not moving or unable to move."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"A crater is a very large hole in the ground."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Pockmarked means marked by small holes and scars."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"If you say something is a big deal ,it\u2019s important or significant in some way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To trace something back means to discover its causes by examining how it developed."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"And finally, the idiom a smoking gun refers to indisputable evidence or conclusive proof of something. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us next time for more scintillating science and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Georgie","Dr Becky

In some ways, the current interest in the Moon is really more about the origins of Earth. One theory is that during the early days of the solar system, around 4 billion years ago, another planet crashed into Earth breaking off a part which then formed the Moon. Unlike the Earth\u2019s surface, which is constantly moving, the Moon is completely still, frozen in time to create a perfectly preserved record of what happened at the birth of the solar system.

And so, if anyone's ever seen an image of the far side of the Moon, the side of the Moon that we cannot see from Earth is incredibly pockmarked .

How long has it been there for as well. Also, various other minerals that might be there, these very heavy minerals that we know come from comets and asteroids.
