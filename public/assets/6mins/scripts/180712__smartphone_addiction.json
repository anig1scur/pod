I'm Rob."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And I'm Catherine."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, Catherine, how long do you spend on your smartphone?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"My smartphone? Not that long really, only about 18 or 19 hours."},{"author":"Rob","text":"No, sorry, I meant in a day, not in a week."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Er, that's what I meant too, Rob \u2013 a day."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh wow, so you\u2019ve even got it right here\u2026"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"\u2026yep, got it now, Rob. Yes, I should tell you that I suffer from FOMO."},{"author":"Rob","text":"FOMO ?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"FOMO - Fear of Missing Out. Something cool or interesting might be happening somewhere, Rob, and I want to be sure I catch it, so I have to keep checking my phone, to make sure, you know, I don\u2019t miss out on anything."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So we could call you a phubber \u2026 Hello\u2026 I said, so you\u2019re a phubber ? Someone who ignores other people because you\u2019d rather look at your phone."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Oh, yeah, that's right."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It sounds like you have a bit of a problem there, Catherine. But you\u2019re not the only one. According to one recent survey, half of teenagers in the USA feel like they are addicted to their mobile phones. If you are addicted to something, you have a physical or mental need to keep on doing it. You can\u2019t stop doing it. You often hear about people being addicted to drugs or alcohol, but you can be addicted to other things too, like mobile phones. So, Catherine, do you think you\u2019re addicted to your phone? How long could you go without it? Catherine? Catherine!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Sorry, Rob, yes, well I think if I went more than a minute, I'd probably get sort of sweaty palms and I think I'd start feeling a bit panicky."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh dear! Well, if I can distract you for a few minutes, can we look at this topic in more detail please? Let's start with a quiz question first though. In what year did the term \u2018smartphone\u2019 first appear in print? Was it:"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK, you've got my full attention now, Rob, and I think it\u2019s 2000, but actually can I just have a quick look on my phone to check the answer?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"No, no, that would be cheating \u2013 for you \u2013 maybe not for the listeners."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Spoilsport."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right, Jean Twenge is a psychologist who has written about the damage she feels smartphones are doing to society. She has written that smartphones have probably led to an increase in mental health problems for teenagers. We\u2019re going to hear from her now, speaking to the BBC. What does she say is one of the dangers of using our phones?"},{"author":"Jean Twenge, psychologist and author","text":"I think everybody\u2019s had that experience of reading their news feed too much, compulsively checking your phone if you\u2019re waiting for a text or getting really into social media then kind of, looking up and realising that an hour has passed."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So what danger does she mention?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, she said that we can get so involved in our phones that we don\u2019t notice the time passing and when we finally look up, we realise that maybe an hour has gone. And I must say, I find that to be true for me, especially when I'm watching videos online. They pull you in with more and more videos and I\u2019ve spent ages just getting lost in video after video."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well that's not a problem if you're looking at our YouTube site, of course - there's lots to see there."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yes, BBC Learning English, no problem. You can watch as many as you like."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, she talks about checking our phones compulsively . If you do something compulsively you can\u2019t really control it - it\u2019s a feature of being addicted to something, you feel you have to do it again and again. Some tech companies, though, are now looking at building in timers to apps which will warn us when we have spent too long on them. Does Jean Twenge think this will be a good idea?"},{"author":"Jean Twenge, psychologist and author","text":"It might mean that people look at social media less frequently and that they do what it really should be used for, which is to keep in touch with people but then put it away and go see some of those people in person or give them a phone call."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, does she think it\u2019s a good idea?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, she doesn\u2019t say so directly, but we can guess from her answer that she does, because she says these timers will make people spend more time in face-to-face interaction, which a lot of people think would be a good thing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, she said we should be using it for keeping in touch with people - which means contacting people, communicating with them and also encouraging us to do that communication in person . If you do something in person then you physically do it \u2013 you go somewhere yourself or see someone yourself, you don\u2019t do it online or through your smartphone, which nicely brings us back to our quiz question. When was the term smartphone first used in print - 1995, 2000 or 2005? What did you say, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I think I said 2005, without looking it up on my phone, Rob!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That's good to know, but maybe looking at your phone would have helped because the answer was 1995. But well done to anybody who did know that."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Or well done to anyone who looked it up on their phone and got the right answer."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Mmm, right, before logging off let\u2019s review today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK, we had FOMO , an acronym that means 'Fear of Missing Out'. Something that I get quite a lot."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And that makes you also a phubber - people who ignore the real people around them because they are concentrating on their phones."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yes, I do think I\u2019m probably addicted to my phone. I have a psychological and physical need to have it. My smartphone is my drug."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Wow, and you look at it compulsively . You can\u2019t stop looking at it, you do it again and again, don't you?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"It's sadly true, Rob. To keep in touch with someone is to contact them and share your news regularly."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And if you do that yourself by actually meeting them, then you are doing it in person . And that brings us to the end of today\u2019s programme. Don\u2019t forget you can find us on the usual social media platforms \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube -  and on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Rob","Catherine","Jean Twenge, psychologist and
