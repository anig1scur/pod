This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In China they\u2019re crescent shaped and filled with pork and cabbage, in Nepal they\u2019re called momos and are fried with buffalo meat. In Ireland they\u2019re soaked in Guinness gravy, and Italians fill them with spinach and call them gnocchi. They can be steamed or fried and are found all over the world. I\u2019m talking, of course, about dumplings."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Dumplings are a group of dishes where a filling is wrapped inside pieces of cooked dough. They\u2019re basically dough envelopes with a filling inside. Fillings can be anything from meat and fish to vegetables, tofu or cheese. And the dough is usually based on a starchy grain like wheat, rice, corn or potato. In fact, the English word, \u2018dumpling\u2019, comes from a 17th century adjective, dump, meaning \u2018dough-like\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The really amazing thing about dumplings is that they\u2019re found all over the world. Over the centuries, different countries and regions have experimented with flavours and fillings to create something unique. Wherever in the world you are there\u2019s probably a special kind of dumpling for you!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be sampling a dumpling from the West African country of Ghana. And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Great! But first I have a question for you, Beth. Probably the most famous British dumplings, suet dumplings, are cooked on top of a chicken or beef stew. They\u2019re made from suet\u2026 but what exactly is that? Is suet:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Hmmm, I think suet is made from animal fat."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Beth, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the correct answer later in the programme. The origins of dumplings are a mystery. Historians think the dish is very old, but no-one knows for sure when or where the first dumpling was cooked. One theory puts the birthplace of the dumpling along the Silk Road, linking China with Central Asia, and Turkey."},{"author":"Beth","text":"One way or another, the dumpling journeyed through the Middle East and across Africa to Ghana, where today it\u2019s a favourite way of adding carbohydrates to a dish, as well as soaking up sauce and juices. Kafui Adzah is a businesswoman and fan of the Ghanian dumpling called, kenkey."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here she introduces kenkey to Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Kafui Adzah","text":"I love kenkey. In fact I had kenkey this afternoon!"},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"You\u2019ve had some this afternoon?"},{"author":"Kafui Adzah","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"Ah, lovely. And it hits the spot ?"},{"author":"Kafui Adzah","text":"Absolutely, and\u2026 the Ga-Adangbe is one of the tribes in Ghana and kenkey is their staple food , even though it\u2019s eaten across the whole country."},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"How is it then eaten?"},{"author":"Kafui Adzah","text":"Now we have to eat kenkey with what we call shito \u2013 chilli sauce. OK. But we also have the black sauce\u2026 it's like with shrimps, fish, and all sort of proteins in it. And then... Yum Yum ! You go at it! You dig in !"},{"author":"Ruth Alexander","text":"Is this really satisfying comfort food ?"},{"author":"Kafui Adzah","text":"It is very satisfying, in fact kenkey is loved by most people who do manual work because it fills the tummy and it takes you almost a whole day before you feel hungry again."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Kafui says eating kenkey really hits the spot . If something hits the spot , it\u2019s exactly what you wanted and totally satisfies you."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Kenkey dumplings are made from maize sourdough and eaten across Ghana. For some tribes, kenkey is their staple food \u2013 a basic and important type of food that is regularly eaten by a large portion of the population. In Britain for example, bread and eggs are staple foods."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Kenkey takes time to make - the maize needs to be soaked in water for a week. But when they\u2019re ready and served with a hot chilli sauce, Kafui uses two phrases to show it\u2019s time to eat. Yum yum ! is used to say that food tastes or smells very good, and dig in ! is another exclamation meaning: don\u2019t wait, start eating and eat as much as you like."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For Ghanaians, kenkey is comfort food , something which is enjoyable to eat and makes you feel happier. And what\u2019s more, it fills your tummy or stomach."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Whatever type you eat and wherever in the world you eat them, dumplings are a great way to spread a little love, including in Britain!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, it looks like we\u2019re back to my earlier question. I asked you what the traditional British suet dumpling is made from. Beth guessed it was animal fat, which was\u2026 the correct answer! Suet dumplings aren\u2019t the healthiest, but for some Brits they\u2019re certainly comfort food - food that makes you feel happier because it tastes good, or because it reminds you of home."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with the idiom hits the spot , meaning that something is satisfying and exactly what you wanted."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A staple food is a basic and important type of food that is regularly eaten by a large portion of the population."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The exclamation yum yum ! is used to say that food tastes or smells delicious."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you say dig in ! you\u2019re inviting someone to start eating as much as they want."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, tummy is an informal word for stomach. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Kafui Adzah","Ruth
