This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil. In 1436 in Germany, Johannes Gutenberg, invented the printing press - a machine capable of making many copies of the same page of text. Ever since, printing has been used around the world to produce books, newspapers and magazines."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Printing technology has come a long way since Gutenberg\u2019s time, but even today\u2019s most advanced laser printers have only printed flat, two-dimensional objects\u2026 until now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re discussing 3D printers \u2013 printers which can build solid, three-dimensional objects out of a variety of materials including plastic, concrete and metal."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Now, Neil, when you say a printer that can make solid objects, I guess you\u2019re not talking about a normal printer\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right, Sam. These large and complex 3D printers work in a completely different way. Unlike a sculptor who chips away at a block of stone to reveal a shape underneath, 3D printers work in the opposite way, building up physical objects by adding material layer on layer. And the ability to print objects in this way is providing solutions to many problems, as we\u2019ll be finding out\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"But first I have a question for you, Neil. Before Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press, copies of texts were made by block printing, using hand-carved wooden blocks pressed into ink. So - what was the oldest known text to be printed this way? Was it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think it might have been a recipe."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. The idea of printing solid objects is not new, but it was only after the millennium that tech companies began to realise how it could be done. Here\u2019s Professor Mark Miodownik, a material scientist at University College, London, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:"},{"author":"Professor Mark Miodownik","text":"As the millennium turned, patents expired and that meant people started making very cheap 3D printers. And people started mucking about with them and going, \u2018Hold on a minute! - it\u2019s not just an industrial tool\u2026. You can put them in schools, you can put them in universities\u2026Ohh, it's actually really great for prototyping\u2019. And then people got excited about it and it became the answer to everything. Everything was going to be 3D-printed!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"After the year 2000, 3D printers suddenly got much cheaper and tech companies started mucking about with them \u2013 spending time playing with them in a fun way. They realised that 3D printers had many uses - for example, they discovered that 3D printers were great at making prototypes \u2013 models of a product that can be tested, improved and used to develop better products."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Professor Miodownik thinks these tech companies were surprised at how useful 3D printing was. He uses the phrase Hold on a minute! to express this surprise or disbelief."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In fact, in turned out that 3D printers were excellent at making bespoke things \u2013 objects which are made specially for a particular person. One area which 3D printing dramatically improved was medical prosthetics - artificial body parts made specially for someone who has lost an arm, a leg or a foot, for example."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In 2021, Stephen Verze, who lost an eye in a childhood accident, became the first person to be fitted with a 3D-printed prosthetic eye. It\u2019s prosthetic, so the new eye doesn't restore Stephen\u2019s sight, but it has boosted his confidence. Surgeon, Mandeep Sagoo, led the team at Moorsfield Hospital that operated on Stephen\u2019s eye. Here he is explaining more to BBC World Service\u2019s, People Fixing The World:"},{"author":"Professor Mandeep Sagoo","text":"In many countries, particularly the developed world, there are facilities for custom-making a prosthetic eye to match the other eye, and that's an artisan process which is very time-consuming and requires real artistry on the part of the ocularist \u2013 the ocularist is the person who fits the prosthetic eye \u2013 and so what we have been developing is a technique to automate the whole process."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even before 3D printers, prosthetic eyes were custom-made, a word similar to \u2018bespoke\u2019 which means specially made according to a particular person\u2019s requirements. But the traditional way of making artificial eyes by hand is very time-consuming \u2013 it takes a lot of time to do. Nowadays, 3D printing can complete the whole process in just thirty minutes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It\u2019s great to see technology helping people, and amazing how far new inventions like 3D printers have come since the days of Johannes Gutenberg\u2026 speaking of which, Neil, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. You asked me about the earliest known text to have been printed using wooden blocks, and I guesses it was a cooking recipe\u2026 So, was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"You were\u2026 wrong, I\u2019m afraid, Neil! The oldest known wooden block print was actually a religious text \u2013 the Buddha\u2019s Diamond Sutra. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with mucking about, an informal way to say playing with something carelessly, not for a serious reason."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A prototype is a model of a product that can be tested, improved and used to develop a better product."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The phrase Hold on a minute! can be used to express surprise or disbelief."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Prosthetics refer to artificial body parts such as arms, legs, feet or eyes, which are used to replace a missing natural part."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The words bespoke, and custom-made describe something specially made for a particular person."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, if something is time-consuming, it takes a lot of time to do.
