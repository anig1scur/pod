Relax!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"What are you doing, Rob? Trying to hypnotise me?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, since hypnotism is the topic of this programme, I thought I\u2019d give it a try! So how do you feel, Sam? Are you under my spell?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, I don\u2019t think so, Rob. It\u2019s not so easy to put me into a hypnotic trance \u2013 that\u2019s the word to describe the state of mind of someone who\u2019s been hypnotised and isn\u2019t completely in control."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You mean like those stage magicians who trick people into clucking like a chicken or playing an imaginary violin?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, some hypnotists make people do silly things for entertainment but hypnotism has real benefits as well - curing phobias, for example."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Maybe so, but for other people the very idea of a hypnotic trance is nonsense. And even if hypnotism is real, why would you let a complete stranger inside your head?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Don\u2019t worry, Rob. I won\u2019t make you cluck like a chicken!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Please don\u2019t! At least, not before my quiz question, which is about a well-known 20th century hypnotist.

Was it: a) Sigmund Freud?, b) Franz Mesmer?, or c) Harry Houdini?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, people who want to quit smoking sometimes use a kind of therapy involving hypnotism, so maybe it\u2019s a) Sigmund Freud!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. One question that\u2019s often asked is whether anyone can be hypnotised - or are there people, maybe like you, Sam, who are less hypnotisable than others?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Professor Amir Raz is a psychiatrist at The Brain Institute in Orange County, California. According to him, there are two things which explain what makes one person more or less hypnotisable than another, as he told BBC World Service programme, The Why Factor."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And listen out for the first thing he mentions:"},{"author":"Prof Amir Raz","text":"Initially people thought that if you\u2019re very intelligent you\u2019re likely to be less suggestible ; if you are male you\u2019re likely to be less suggestible than if you\u2019re female; and so on. These have been largely dismissed."},{"author":"Nicola Kelly","text":"In fact, it\u2019s about two things. First, absorption\u2026"},{"author":"Prof Amir Raz","text":"Your ability to get engrossed in a particular activity \u2013 we all know people who are capable of reading a book and losing track of time , we know the same thing about people who are watching a film and beginning to cry, having all these emotional reactions, again getting very much sucked into the scene and being riveted."},{"author":"Sam","text":"People often think you can be easily hypnotised if you are suggestible ,or easily influenced by others."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In fact, hypnotism is about two things. Did you hear the first thing, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes - it\u2019s getting absorbed; so absorbed that you lose track of time - become so occupied with something that you are unaware of the passing time."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And getting absorbed can also mean you get sucked into something - become involved in a situation when you do not want to be involved."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Stage hypnotists often speak in a soothing, gentle ways to help this process of getting someone absorbed or sucked in!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"But according to Professor Raz, there\u2019s a second important part to being hypnotised: attention."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Listen to the definition of attention Professor Raz gives to BBC World Service programme, The Why Factor:"},{"author":"Prof Amir Raz","text":"The ability to get focused, to concentrate and hone in on particular, select pieces of information to the exclusion of others."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Besides the relaxed, dream-like feeling of being absorbed, what\u2019s also needed is the concentration to hone in on something , in other words, to give it your full attention."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What you hone in on could be the way the hypnotist speaks, like how Rob said, \u201cLook into my eyes!\u201d at the beginning of the programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Or it could be some other object, like a moving finger, a pendulum or a swinging watch that some hypnotists use."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I don\u2019t feel hypnotised, Rob, but I\u2019m certainly focused on one thing \u2013 my lunch! So come on, tell me \u2013 what's the correct answer to the quiz question?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam. I asked you which hypnotist was so famous that his name became used as a verb. And what did you say?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guessed it was a) Sigmund Freud."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It was a good guess \u2013 but the correct answer was b) a German doctor called, Franz Mesmer."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course! And the word named after him was\u2026 mesmerised \u2013 to have your attention completely fixed so that you can\u2019t think of anything else."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, that might be a problem if you want to remember this vocabulary, so let\u2019s recap the words we\u2019ve learned, starting with trance \u2013 a state of consciousness in which you are not completely aware or in control."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Someone who is suggestible is easily influenced by other people."},{"author":"Rob","text":"When you lose track of time , you become so absorbed with something that you are unaware of time passing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And you might get sucked in - become involved in a situation that you don\u2019t want to."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hypnotism also depends on concentration and the ability to hone in on something - to give something your full attention\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2026until you\u2019re mesmerised \u2013 you have your attention completely fixed so that you cannot think of anything else."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s all for this hypnotic journey.
