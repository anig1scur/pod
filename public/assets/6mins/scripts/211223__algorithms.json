This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What do shopping with a credit card, finding love through internet dating and waiting for the traffic lights to change have in common?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, they all involve computers?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good guess, Sam! But how exactly do those computers work? The answer is that they all use algorithms \u2013 sets of mathematical instructions which find solutions to problems."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Although they are often hidden, algorithms are all around us. From mobile phone maps to home delivery pizza, they play a big part of modern life. And they\u2019re the topic of this programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A simple way to think of algorithms is as recipes. To make pancakes you mix flour, eggs and milk, then melt butter in a frying pan and so on. Computers do this in more a complicated way by repeating mathematical equations over and over again."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Equations are mathematical sentences showing how two things are equal. They\u2019re similar to algorithms and the most famous scientific equation of all, Einstein's E=MC2, can be thought of as a three-part algorithm."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before my brain gets squashed by all this maths, I have a quiz question for you, Sam. As you know, Einstein\u2019s famous equation is E=MC2 - but what does the \u2018E\u2019 stand for? Is it: a)    electricity? b)    energy?  or c)    everything?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m tempted to say \u2018E\u2019 is for \u2018everything\u2019 but I reckon I know the answer: b \u2013 \u2018E\u2019 stands for \u2018energy\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right later in the programme."},{"author":"Sam","text":"With all this talk of computers, you might think algorithms are a new idea. In fact, they\u2019ve been around since Babylonian times, around 4,000 years ago."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And their use today can be controversial. Some algorithms used in internet search engines have been accused of racial prejudice."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ramesh Srinivasan is Professor of Information Studies at the University of California. Here\u2019s what he said when asked what the word \u2018algorithm\u2019 actually means by BBC World Service\u2019s programme, The Forum:"},{"author":"Ramesh Srinivasan","text":"My understanding of the term \u2018algorithm\u2019 is that it\u2019s not necessarily the bogyman , or its not necessarily something that is, you know, inscrutable or mysterious to all people \u2013 it\u2019s the set of instructions that you write in some mathematical form or in some software code \u2013 so it\u2019s the repeated set of instructions that are sequenced, that are used and applied to answer a question or resolve a problem \u2013 it\u2019s a simple as that, actually."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Some think that algorithms have been controversial, but Professor Srinivasan says they are not necessarily the bogyman . The bogyman refers to something people call \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018evil\u2019 to make other people afraid."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Srinivasan thinks algorithms are neither evil nor inscrutable \u2013 not showing emotions or thoughts and therefore very difficult to understand."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Still, it can be difficult to understand exactly what algorithms are, especially when there are many different types of them. So, let\u2019s take an example."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s autumn and we want to collect all the apples from our orchard and divide them into three groups \u2013 big, medium and small. One method is to collect all the apples together and compare their sizes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But doing this would take hours! It\u2019s much easier to first collect the apples from only one tree - divide those into big, medium or small \u2013 and then repeat the process for the other trees, one by one."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s basically what algorithms do \u2013 they find the most efficient way to get things done, or in other words, get the best results in the quickest time."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Mathematics professor Ian Stewart agrees. Listen as he explains how the algorithm called \u2018bubble sort\u2019 works to BBC World Service\u2019s programme, The Forum:"},{"author":"Ian Stewart","text":"Think of when your computer is sorting emails by date and maybe you\u2019ve got 500 emails and it sorts them by date in a flash. Now it doesn\u2019t use bubble sort, but it does use a sorting method and if you tried to do that by hand it would take you a very long time, whatever method you used."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Stewart describes how algorithms sort emails. To sort is a verb meaning to group together things which share similarities."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Just like grouping the apples by size, sorting hundreds of emails by hand would take a long time. But using algorithms, computers do it in a flash \u2013 very quickly or suddenly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That phrase \u2013 in a flash \u2013 reminds me of how Albert Einstein came up with his famous equation, E=MC2."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And that reminds me of your quiz question. You asked about the \u2018E\u2019 in E=MC2. I said it stands for \u2018energy\u2019. So, was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Energy\u2019 is the correct answer. Energy equals \u2018M\u2019 for mass, multiplied by the Constant \u2018C\u2019 which is the speed of light, squared."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with equation \u2013 a mathematical statement using symbols to show two equal things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If something is called a bogyman , it\u2019s something considered bad and to be feared."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Inscrutable people don\u2019t show their emotions so are very difficult to get to know."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Efficient means working quickly and effectively in an organised way"},{"author":"Sam","text":"The verb to sort means to group together things which share similarities."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, if something happens in a flash , it happens quickly or suddenly."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s all the time we have to discuss algorithms. And if you\u2019re still not 100% sure about exactly what they are, we hope at least you\u2019ve learned some useful vocabulary!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Join us again soon for more trending topics, sensational science and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
