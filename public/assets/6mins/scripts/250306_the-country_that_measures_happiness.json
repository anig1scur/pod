This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"And I\u2019m Pippa. In this programme we\u2019re talking about happiness."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It makes me happy when I\u2019m with a group of old friends and we\u2019re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?"},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don\u2019t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m not surprised. That sounds great."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"So, happiness means different things to different people, but what\u2019s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We\u2019ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it\u2019s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day:"},{"author":"Pippa","text":"I\u2019m going to say the 20th June, because it would be sunny in the UK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s find out if you're right at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world \u2013 the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:"},{"author":"Dr Ha Vinh Tho","text":"So, his idea was: 'How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric ?' Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies."},{"author":"Charmaine Cozier","text":"So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage ."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact \u2013 they\u2019re complete and unspoiled."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"As a result, the happiness of Bhutan\u2019s people took centre stage , it became the most important thing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bhutan\u2019s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain ."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project\u2019s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service\u2019s, The Inquiry:"},{"author":"Charmaine Cozier","text":"The project is also about reversing Bhutan's brain drain ."},{"author":"Dr Lhawang Ugyel","text":"The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it's also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan\u2019s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they\u2019ve learned abroad through upskilling . And upskilling is the process where workers\u2019 skills are improved through training."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it\u2019s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Yes, that\u2019s true \u2013 and it reminds me of your question, Neil\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?"},{"author":"Pippa","text":"I said it was the 20th June in the summer in the UK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, maybe it\u2019s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it\u2019s actually the 20th March."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Nice."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you\u2019ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with modernise , to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"A country\u2019s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective intact means complete and undamaged."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"If something takes centre stage , it becomes more important than anything else."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"And finally, upskilling means improving workers\u2019 skills through training and experience.
