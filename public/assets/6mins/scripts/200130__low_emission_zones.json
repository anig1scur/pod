This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re discussing low emission zones and explaining some useful items of vocabulary along the way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s good, Sam. But what exactly is a low emission zone?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, the noun emission is an amount of, usually, gas, that is sent out into the air and harms the environment \u2013 it\u2019s pollution. And a low emission zone is an area of a city where the amount of pollution is controlled."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course, and cities like London have them - most vehicles, including cars and vans, need to meet certain emissions standards or their drivers must pay a daily charge to drive within the zone \u2013 or they might even be banned altogether."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Exactly. It\u2019s all about making the air we breathe cleaner. And my question today is about one UK city which recently announced it wants to be the country\u2019s first \u2018net zero\u2019 city - placing their greenhouse emissions at a neutral level. But which one is it? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, I\u2019ve heard about this and I\u2019m sure it is a) Glasgow."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I'll let you know if that was correct at the end of the programme. Now, Neil mentioned that London already has an ultra-low emission zone. But this year, other UK cities, including Bath, Leeds and Birmingham, are also bringing in Clean Air Zones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And around the world, many other cities, like Beijing, Paris and Madrid have these zones. Although there are many types of emissions, such as from factories, these zones predominantly target exhaust fumes from vehicles \u2013 poisonous gases called nitrogen dioxide."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Let\u2019s hear from an expert on this - Alastair Lewis, who is a Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of York. He spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science programme and explained why we should be trying to reduce these pollutants \u2013 a word for the substances that cause pollution\u2026"},{"author":"Alastair Lewis, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry, University of York","text":"Most of the evidence we have now on air pollution is that we continue to see health benefits by reducing pollution, even when you're below the target value. So, just because the city meets a particular value, there is still an incentive to continue to improve air quality, because the health benefits continue to build up as you do that. So, targets are very good at focusing the mind , but they shouldn't be the only thing that we're considering."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Alastair Lewis mentions \u2018targets\u2019. These are official levels of something that need to be achieved. They give us something to aim for \u2013 in this case reducing air pollution."},{"author":"Sam","text":"He uses the phrase \u2018 focusing the mind\u2019 \u2013 that means to concentrate on one idea or thought."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But, while setting a target to cut air pollution is good \u2013 it has health benefits \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t just focus on meeting the target. Even if the target is met, we shouldn\u2019t stop trying to improve. The incentive should be that we are improving people\u2019s health."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And an incentive is something that encourages someone to do something. So, I think it\u2019s accepted that creating low emission zones is an incentive because it encourages people to either not drive into cities or to, at least, drive low-polluting vehicles."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And, of course, changing to electric-powered cars is one way to do this. There\u2019s more of an incentive to do this now, at least in the UK, because the government has said new diesel and petrol cars and vans will be banned from 2040."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But pollution from vehicles is just part of the problem, as Alastair Lewis points out\u2026"},{"author":"Alastair Lewis, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry, University of York","text":"One has to accept that air pollution is an enormously complex problem with a very very large number of contributing sources, and there will never be any one single action that will cure the problem for us. So, low emission zones are one way to reduce concentrations , but they are not, in isolation, going to be the solution."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, Alastair points out that air pollution is a complex problem \u2013 it\u2019s complicated, difficult and involves many parts."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, there are many sources \u2013 things that create these emissions. So, it\u2019s not possible to solve - or cure \u2013 the problem by doing one thing. Low emission zones are only one part of the solution to the problem."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He said it was one way to reduce concentrations \u2013 he means amounts of substances, pollutants, found in something, which here is the air."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, earlier, Neil, you had to concentrate your mind and answer a question about emissions. I asked which UK city recently announced it wants to be the country\u2019s first \u2018net zero\u2019 city - placing their greenhouse emissions at a neutral level. Was it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said it\u2019s Glasgow."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And it is Glasgow! Well done, Neil. It wants to become the UK's first \u2018net zero\u2019 city. And later this year it is hosting a major United Nations climate change summit."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, I think we need a recap of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed, starting with emissions \u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Emissions are amounts of, usually, gas that is sent out into the air from things like cars. They harm the environment. And pollutants are the actual substances that cause pollution\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"To focus the mind means to concentrate on one idea or thought."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And we mentioned an incentive , which is something that encourages someone to do something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Complex describes something that is complicated, difficult and involves many parts."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And when talking about pollution, we sometimes talk about concentrations. These are amounts of substances, or pollutants, within something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, in a polluted city, we might find high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide because of all the traffic \u2013 it\u2019s not great for our health, Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Indeed, Neil \u2013 that\u2019s why we need low emission zones!
