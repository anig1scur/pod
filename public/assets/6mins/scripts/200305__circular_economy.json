Do go on."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thank you. So the amount of waste we produce around the world is huge and it\u2019s a growing problem."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But, there are some things that we can do, like recycling. Where I live, I can recycle a lot, and I\u2019m always very careful to separate - to split my rubbish into paper, metal, food, plastic and so on."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But is that enough, even if we all do it? We\u2019ll look a little more at this topic shortly, but first, as always, a question. Which country recycles the highest percentage of its waste? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019m not sure, but I think it could be Germany so I\u2019m going to go with that - Germany."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re right a little bit later on. The BBC radio programme, Business Daily, recently tackled this topic. They spoke to Alexandre Lemille, an expert in this area. Does he think recycling is the answer? Let\u2019s hear what he said."},{"author":"Alexandre Lemille","text":"Recycling is not the answer to waste from an efficient point of view because we are not able to get all the waste separated properly and therefore treated in the background. The main objective of our model is to hide waste so we don\u2019t see as urban citizens, or rural citizens, we don\u2019t see the waste, it is out of sight and therefore out of mind ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What\u2019s his view of recycling?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I was a bit surprised, because he said recycling wasn\u2019t the answer. One reason is that it\u2019s not always possible to separate waste you can recycle from waste you can\u2019t recycle, and that makes treating it very difficult. Treating means handling it and using different processes, so it can be used again."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the result is a lot of waste, including waste that could be recycled but which is just hidden. And as long as we don\u2019t see it, we don\u2019t think about it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And he uses a good phrase to describe this \u2013 out of sight, out of mind . And that\u2019s true, at least for me. My rubbish and recycling is collected and I don\u2019t really think about what happens to it after that. Is as much of it recycled as I think, or is it just buried, burned or even sent to other countries? It\u2019s not in front of my house, so I don\u2019t really think about it \u2013 out of sight, out of mind."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s listen again"},{"author":"Alexandre Lemille","text":"Recycling is not the answer to waste from an efficient point of view because we are not able to get all the waste separated properly and therefore treated in the background. The main objective of our model is to hide waste so we don\u2019t see as urban citizens, or rural citizens, we don\u2019t see the waste, it is out of sight and therefore out of mind ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One possible solution to this problem is to develop what is called a circular economy. Here\u2019s the presenter of Business Daily, Manuela Saragosa, explaining what that means."},{"author":"Manuela Saragosa","text":"The idea then at the core of a circular economic and business model is that a product, like say a washing machine or even a broom, can always be returned to the manufacturer to be reused or repaired before then sold on again. The point is the manufacturer retains responsibility for the lifecycle of the product it produces rather than the consumer assuming that responsibility when he or she buys it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So it seems like a simple idea \u2013 though maybe very difficult to do."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, the idea is that the company that makes a product, the manufacturer , is responsible for the product, not the person who bought it, the consumer ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Neil So, if the product breaks or reaches the end of its useful life, its lifecycle , then the manufacturer has to take it back and fix, refurbish or have it recycled."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guess this would make manufacturers try to make their products last longer!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It certainly would. Let\u2019s listen again."},{"author":"Manuela Saragosa","text":"The idea then at the core of a circular economic and business model is that a product, like say a washing machine or even a broom, can always be returned to the manufacturer to be reused or repaired before then sold on again.

Which country recycles the highest percentage of its waste? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think it\u2019s Germany."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well I would like to offer you congratulations because Germany is the correct answer. Now let\u2019s go over the vocabulary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course. To separate means to divide or split different things, for example, separate your plastic from your paper for recycling."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Treating is the word for dealing with, for example, recycled waste."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The phrase out of sight, out of mind , means ignoring something or a situation you can\u2019t see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A manufacturer is the person or company that makes something and the consumer is the person who buys that thing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the length of time you can expect a product to work for is known as its lifecycle ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well the lifecycle of this programme is 6 minutes, and as we are there, or thereabouts, it\u2019s time for us to head off.
