But maybe you should \u2013 because in this programme we\u2019re looking at how talking to strangers might actually be good for you! But first, let me talk to you about today\u2019s question. I\u2019d like you to answer this. To make conversation we need words \u2013 so according to the Oxford English dictionary, approximately how many words are in use in the English language? Is it\u2026 a)    171,146 b)    271,146 c)    371,146"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"We use a lot of words in English, but not 371,000 \u2013 so I\u2019ll go for a) 171,146."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, as always I will reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, let\u2019s continue our conversation about having conversations with strangers! Many of us spend part of every day surrounded by strangers, whether on our commute to work, sitting in a park or cafe, or visiting the supermarket."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But we rarely reach out and talk to them because we fear it would make us both feel uncomfortable \u2013 or awkward. And Gillian Sandstrom, social psychologist from Essex University in the UK, can explain why. Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s All In The Mind programme\u2026."},{"author":"Gillian Sandstrom, Social psychologist, Essex University","text":"We kind of underestimate , we have this negative voice in our head that's telling us \"I shouldn't have said that, why did I do that? I said that story better last time\". But the other person doesn't know any of that and they\u2019re probably\u2026 they might be anticipating that they won't have a positive conversation and then they do. And they think, wow, that person was amazing. So we walk round with this fear that the other person isn\u2019t going to be interested in talking to us."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Fascinating stuff. So we have a negative voice in our head telling us about all the bad things that might happen. We basically underestimate ourselves."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To underestimate means to think that something is smaller or less important than it really is. We worry that what we say won\u2019t be interesting or important enough."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah, but the other person doesn\u2019t know that. They\u2019re also anticipating \u2013 or guessing - the outcome. They're thinking that if they have a conversation, it won\u2019t go well. But of course, when strangers do talk to each other it normally goes well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, it\u2019s just fear that is stopping us. But if we get over that fear, and get chatting, people might actually like us \u2013 and we might make new friends."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Another reason why you should pluck up the courage to talk to strangers is that it\u2019s good for our health!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018 Pluck up the courage\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a good phrase, Georgina, meaning force yourself to do something that you\u2019re scared about and\u2026 research by the University of Chicago found we may often underestimate the positive impact of connecting with others for both our own and others' wellbeing."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And connecting here means starting or having a good relationship with someone. So the research found that, for example, having a conversation with a stranger on your way to work may leave you both feeling happier than you would think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Gillian Sandstrom also spoke about her research and the power of talking to strangers on the You and Yours programme. Listen out for the word \u2018connected\u2019\u2026"},{"author":"Gillian Sandstrom, Social psychologist, Essex University","text":"What we've shown in the research is that it's really good for your mood. So people are in a better mood after they reach out and have a conversation, however minimal, and the other thing that the research has shown is that just makes people feel more connected to each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There you go! Talking to strangers is good for our mood \u2013 and mood means the way we feel. It\u2019s good for our mental health \u2013 and we might discover people actually like us! And even if we\u2019re an introvert \u2013 a person who prefers to be alone rather than with other people - experiments have shown that talking to others can make us happier."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The problem remains, Neil, that when speaking to someone new, what do you talk about?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"How about some interesting facts \u2013 like approximately how many words are in use in the English language? Which is what I asked you earlier. Is it? a)    171,146 b)    271,146 c)    371,146 What did you say, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said 171,146. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Spot on, Georgina. Well done! Yes, there are an estimated 171,146 words currently in use in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary \u2013plus many more obsolete words."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I shall pick a few of them and make conversation with someone on the Tube later, but not before we recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve explained."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 so we highlighted six words, starting with underestimate which is to think that something is smaller or less important than it really is."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Anticipating means guessing or expecting a certain outcome. I anticipate this programme to be 6 minutes long!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s a given! Next, we mentioned the phrase to pluck up the courage ,meaning to force yourself to do something that you\u2019re scared or nervous about."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When you connect with someone, it means you start or have a good relationship with someone. I think we\u2019ve connected on this programme, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Absolutely, Georgina. And that\u2019s put me in a good mood \u2013 mood means the way we feel."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And finally, an introvert is a person who prefers to spend time on their own."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks, Georgina.  Well, that\u2019s our conversation over, but you can hear more from us on our website and on our app. Goodbye!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["","Neil","Georgina","Gillian
