This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let me tell you a story, Georgina. Are you ready?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Grandma had always warned me not to look into the mirror at midnight. There was something strange about that mirror, she said. How childish \u2013 to believe silly stories! Later that night I heard a noise. I woke up, dark and alone. A clock chimed midnight. The floorboards were creaking as I walked towards the mirror. I looked into my face reflecting in the glass, when suddenly - my eye winked!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Agh, stop Neil! You\u2019re scaring me!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh sorry, Georgina! OK, let\u2019s try another story: Once upon a time there was a beautiful servant girl who lived with her wicked stepmother and two jealous stepsisters\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah, that\u2019s better, Neil, and I know this story \u2013 Cinderella \u2013 more romantic and much less scary!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"As you can see from Georgina\u2019s reaction, telling stories is a powerful way to connect and communicate with people - and the topic of this programme."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Stories help us make sense of the world, which is why we\u2019ve been telling them to each other for millennia \u2013 and why some of the earliest folk tales \u2013 stories that parents have told and passed on to their children over many years \u2013 are still being told today."},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to the novelist Sandra Newman, and other academics, there are seven classic plotlines which are constantly being recycled into new stories. They include \u2018rags to riches\u2019 plots, like Cinderella\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"\u2018Defeating the monster\u2019 plots, like Dracula\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026and other plots such as \u2018comedies\u2019, \u2018adventures\u2019 and \u2018tragedies\u2019. So, my quiz question is this: which of the following well-known folk tales is a \u2018defeating the monster\u2019 story? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, they all have beasts, bears or wolves in the title, so I\u2019ll guess b) Beauty and the Beast."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll come back to that later. It\u2019s interesting to ask how we can explain the lasting appeal of these classic plotlines. Someone who might know is anthropologist and writer, Professor Jamie Tarani."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here he is talking to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Why Factor. See if you can spot his answer."},{"author":"Jamie Tarani","text":"Often the reason why we feel so motivated to pass on stories is because the stories do tap into certain universal human fantasies and fears that will often transcend the concerns of particular times and places. We are intensely moralistic \u2013 most of the time, the bad guys have unhappy endings and the good guys have happy endings. We know that in the real world it doesn\u2019t actually work like that so there\u2019s an element of wish-fulfillment that somehow satisfies our moral appetite."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Stories from very different cultures often have plots with similar fantasies and fears. These human emotions are universal , meaning they exist everywhere and relate to everyone in the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Classic stories work because they tap into basic human emotions \u2013 they understand and express what it means to be human."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unlike in the real world, stories can reinforce our sense of morality - evil stepmothers get punished, Cinderella marries her prince and everyone lives happily ever after. In this way they create wish-fulfillment \u2013 the achievement of what we really want and desire."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, so much for plotlines, Neil, but that still doesn\u2019t explain how stories have the power to catch and hold our attention."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s hear from novelist Sandra Newman, author of How Not To Write a Novel \u2013 a handbook of over 200 common mistakes."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here she tells BBC World Service\u2019s, The Why Factor, that her absolute number one storytelling rule is comprehensibility \u2013 people need to understand your story."},{"author":"Sandra Newman","text":"There are some people who actually are so unfortunately bad at communicating that even when they tell a story to another person it becomes incomprehensible. And gradually as they stop making sense and ramble and digress and don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going, you see everybody not only lose interest but become hostile \u2013 people become very frustrated when someone is not getting to the point ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to Sandra, the biggest mistake is incomprehensibility or not understanding the plot because the storyteller is rambling \u2013 talking in a confused way, going off the subject or not making sense."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When listeners give a story their time and attention, they want the storyteller to get to the point - start talking about the most important and relevant information."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But to cut a long story short, Georgina, it\u2019s time to return to the quiz question. Remember I asked you which famous folk tale had a \u2018defeating the monster\u2019 plot. What did you say?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said the answer was b) Beauty and the Beast. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Your answer was\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Oh, do get to the point, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026wrong! In fact, the answer is, a) Beowulf - an Old English epic about the hero, Beowulf, who defeats dragons and beasts."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, Neil, there are two sides to every story, as the saying goes. So, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with folk tales \u2013 popular stories that have been told and passed down over generations."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many folk tales contain universal ideas \u2013 ideas which exist everywhere, in every age and culture. Stories tap into these ideas, meaning they understand, connect to and express them."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Wish-fulfillment means the achievement or realisation of things you really want and desire."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A good storyteller will never ramble - talk in a confused way, often going off the subject or not making much sense."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And instead will get to the point - start talking about what is most important and relevant."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all we have time for, but remember to join us again soon for the inside story on trending English topics and vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English.
