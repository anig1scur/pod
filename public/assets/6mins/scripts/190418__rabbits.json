Rabbits are cute and fluffy and a most adorable creature for some, but others find it a pest that can multiply rapidly and cause problems. Even in literature rabbits have been represented in very different ways: from the sweet characters of Beatrix Potter, to tricksters like Peter Rabbit.

But there is an animal people often associate with Easter..."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Rabbits! Cute, adorable and fluffy \u2013 what's not to like about a rabbit?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, not everyone is a fan of them \u2013 by not a fan of I mean they don't like them. Some people think they are a pest.  But we'll be telling you more about rabbits shortly."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That's good to know. Well, I'll tell you what I am a fan of and that is your quiz questions \u2013 so what are you going to ask me today?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It's all about wild rabbits. In the last rabbit survey in 1995, how many were estimated to exist in the UK? Is it..."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I know rabbits are everywhere in the UK but not 37 million of them \u2013 so I'll go for b) 3,750,000."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you\u2019ll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out. But you're right when you say rabbits are everywhere in the UK. It's probably true in other countries too. You could say they are endemic \u2013 meaning very common or strongly established in a place or situation."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But are they a typically British wild animal?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"They are now but it's believed they were brought to the country by invaders \u2013 some say The Romans, others The Normans. But they eventually spread across the UK. Victoria Dickinson is author of a book called Rabbit and she's been telling the BBC Radio 4 programme Costing The Earth about what helped them spread..."},{"author":"Victoria Dickinson, author","text":"It was really by the middle of the 17th Century when people really started to think about rabbit as being particularly British...and certainly there were more rabbits in Britain than in the rest of Europe. There was a calculation done that there are over 400 villages and towns in Britain with the word ' warren ' in their name. So the rabbits were raised in Britain but they really kept to their warrens until there was the rise of fox hunting - when their predators disappeared rabbits do what rabbits do best, and they started to multiply and become wild, feral rabbits throughout the land."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Victoria knows a thing or two about rabbits \u2013 and said the word ' warren ' used in town and village names, is evidence that they've been in the UK since the mid-17th Century. A warren is the area underground where rabbits live with lots of holes and connected passages."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But today we use the word warren to mean a building or part of a town where there are lots of confusing passageways or streets. It's a kind of place where you get lost."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But it was rabbit warrens where rabbits would live until hunting, particularly fox hunting, was introduced and that killed many of the rabbit's predators. A predator is an animal that hunts and kills another animal."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now, Victoria was talking about feral rabbits \u2013 so wild rabbits \u2013 not the sort people keep at pets in a rabbit hutch.  Moving on \u2013 I'm interested to know why not everyone loves these cute little creatures, I mean, think of the rabbit characters in the Beatrix Potter stories."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well they weren't always well behaved. And Victoria Dickinson spoke to the Costing the Earth programme about this. What word did she use to describe rabbits having the two opposite sides to their character?"},{"author":"Victoria Dickinson, author","text":"The rabbit is a paradoxical animal; it has a lot of faces if you will. It's both wild and tame, it's timid but also has its reputation as trickster rabbit - if you think of Peter Cottontail, or you think of Br'er Rabbits - and I think our relationship with rabbit is the rabbit of the nursery rhyme, the rabbit of childhood or you think of Peter Rabbit."},{"author":"Rob","text":"She said that rabbits are paradoxical animals \u2013 that's the word that describes them having two opposing characteristics."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 we think of them as wild, maybe a trickster \u2013 someone who deceives people to get what they want. Like Peter \u2013 what a cheeky rabbit!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"But we also think of rabbits as tame \u2013 we have nursery rhymes about them, kids have soft cuddly rabbit toys. I say that they're the perfect symbol for Easter."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Rob, if you say so. But now let me answer the question I set you earlier. In the last survey of rabbits in 1995, how many were estimated to exist in the UK? Was it..."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said b) 3,750,000."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you're wrong Rob! A government survey put the population in the UK at 37.5 million \u2013 so a lot more. But despite its reputation, a recent survey suggests rabbit numbers in the UK have declined by around 60 per cent over the last 20 years."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That is sad news. But let's cheer ourselves up with a recap of the vocabulary we've discussed today, starting with a fan of ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When someone is a fan of something, they are keen on it, they like it a lot.
