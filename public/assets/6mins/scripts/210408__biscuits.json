This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re talking about biscuits!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Biscuits \u2013 a subject very close to my heart \u2013 something important to me and that interests me."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I know, Rob. You are a biscuit connoisseur after all.  And in the UK, many of us love to nibble on these sweet treats. And we have lots of names for them too."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, we have the chocolate digestive, the garibaldi, the custard cream and the jammie dodger. It\u2019s making my mouth water."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I can see. But we\u2019re not going to be tucking into any biscuits today. Instead, we\u2019ll be looking at the origins and the language of this humble snack. And before we do that, Rob, let\u2019s test your knowledge of biscuits with a question. The British aren\u2019t the only fans of biscuits. So in which country are barazeks traditionally eaten? Is it in\u2026 a) Syria, b) Morocco, or c) Spain?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hmmm, well I have not eaten one, but I\u2019ll have a guess at Syria."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the right answer later on. But now, let\u2019s talk more about biscuits, also sometimes known as cookies. They come in all shapes, sizes and varieties."},{"author":"Rob","text":"They can be sweet or savoury \u2013 but I prefer the sweet ones that are crisp, crunchy and are good for dunking in my tea. Dunking means dipping into liquid for a short period of time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But enough about your eating habits, Rob. Let\u2019s find out how the biscuit got its name. It\u2019s something the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth has been exploring. Dr Laura Wright, a historical linguist from the University of Cambridge, explains its origins\u2026"},{"author":"Dr Laura Wright, historical linguist, University of Cambridge","text":"From Latin \u2018biscoctum\u2019 \u2013 twice cooked. And it comes to us via Anglo-Norman French, but it\u2019s bread that\u2019s been cooked twice to extract all the moisture so that it goes hard, and it\u2019ll stay fit for consumption for a very long time, which is why you can take it to sea and have a sea biscuit... and from the 1500 at least we spelt it like it sounds \u2018bisket\u2019\u2026 but at some point, in the 1800, we started to prefer the French spelling for reasons of poncy-ness!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, the English word for biscuits has its origins in Latin. It describes cooking bread twice to make it hard. This baking process meant a biscuit could be kept for a long time, and as Dr Wright said, it would stay fit for consumption \u2013 another way of saying \u2018 edible\u2019 or able to be eaten."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s why they were taken on long sea voyages \u2013 but they weren\u2019t like the biscuits we eat now \u2013 they were plain, simple and very hard baked. Interestingly, the word biscuit used to be spelt B-I-S-K-E-T but the French spelling B-I-S-C-U-I-T was later adopted."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Biscuits are a handy go-to snack for when I\u2019m hungry or bored. But how did biscuits become such a popular foodstuff and how did we come to depend on them so much?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s something Anastasia Edwards, author of Biscuits and Cookies, A Global History, talked about in the Word of Mouth programme. Listen to the word she uses to mean 'food' in her explanation\u2026"},{"author":"Anastasia Edwards, author","text":"One key fact in the rise in the popularity of the biscuit is meal times. Before the Industrial Revolution, people have a later breakfast and earlier supper. By the end of the Industrial Revolution, breakfast is much earlier, the evening meal is much later, so you\u2019ve got this big gap of time where people need sustenance , and so lunch comes to greater prominence and tea time comes to greater prominence, and snacking \u2013 so there\u2019s this great opportunity for biscuits \u2013 something small, something ready, something easily consumable, not expensive, you know, a bit of a sugar rush ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, so it was the Industrial Revolution that led to the rise \u2013 that's the increase \u2013 in the popularity of biscuits. Because the time between breakfast and dinner in the evening increased, people got hungry and they needed food to give them energy \u2013 what Anastasia called sustenance ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, this is when smaller meals, such as lunch or tea, became important or more well-known \u2013 it had greater prominence . And this included snacking on biscuits. These were cheap and easily consumable \u2013 easy and quick to eat. And because of their ingredients, they gave you a sugar rush -  a quick blast of energy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course, now, we eat biscuits at any time, and because of their sugar content, we know to only eat them in moderation \u2013 Rob!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I think a packet a day is fine \u2013 but a whole box, well, that would really take the biscuit!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Take the biscuit! Good idiom there, Rob, to mean \u2018be the most foolish, annoying or surprising thing to do\u2019.  But now let\u2019s find out the answer to my quiz question. Earlier, I asked which country are barazeks traditionally eaten in?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I thought Syria. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, you were. Well done. You are a smart cookie!Barazeks are biscuits filled with roasted sesame seeds and pistachio chips."},{"author":"Rob","text":"They sound delicious. I would love to try some."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well we\u2019ve been discussing the language of biscuits and mentioned some of these words. Dunking describes dipping something, like a biscuit, into liquid for a short period of time."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Describing something as being fit for consumption means it is edible \u2013 which is another one of our words and means \u2018it can be eaten\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sustenance is another word for food. And something that has prominence is important or more well-known."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And when you get a sugar rush , you get a quick blast of energy from, unsurprisingly, eating something containing lots of sugar."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well, we only get six minutes for this programme \u2013 that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles \u2013 so we\u2019re out of time. Bye for now."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Goodbye."}],"authors":["Neil","Rob","Dr Laura Wright, historical linguist, University of Cambridge","Anastasia Edwards,
