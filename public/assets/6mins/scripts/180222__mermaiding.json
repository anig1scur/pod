But for some people, going up and down a pool can be tedious. Now there's a new trend of dressing up and swimming like a mermaid. It's called mermaiding and although it's aimed at teaching kids to be safe in water, it's catching on with adults too.

I'm Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now Neil, I know you're a keen swimmer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I am. I try to get to the pool once a week and do a few lengths, yes."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That's good to hear because swimming is one of the best sports for keeping fit. It's an aerobic exercise \u2013 aerobic means a very active type of exercise that makes your heart and lungs stronger. The opposite of this is anaerobic \u2013 and for my question today Neil, I wonder if you know which of these activities is an example of anaerobic exercise?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I don't have a clue but I'll pick my favourite sport \u2013 a) weightlifting."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Is that really your favourite sport?! Anyway, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So what about you Rob \u2013 do you visit the swimming pool very often?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Only to use the cafe! I don't like anything aquatic \u2013 I mean connected to water. I just don't like getting wet - and swimming up and down a pool is just boring!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well there are alternatives to plain swimming. There's synchronised swimming\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Synchronised \u2013 that's moving together at the same time or speed as someone else. Like dancing in water I suppose? Hmm, I'm not a good dancer either."},{"author":"Neil","text":"How about the new craze of 'mermaiding' which is making a splash at the moment \u2013 in other words becoming very popular. The idea originated in America but is now popular in the UK and Europe."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. Tell me more!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let's hear from an expert \u2013 Emma Longden, who's founder of Fin2Fit \u2013 which runs classes, teaching the skills of swimming safely like a mermaid\u2026"},{"author":"Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit","text":"Mermaiding is putting a monofin on your feet. Putting a beautiful tail on and getting in the water and swimming like a mermaid."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, so I would need to wear a monofin \u2013 the prefix ' mono ' means 'only one or single' \u2013 so a single fin \u2013that's  like a mermaid's tail - then I just get in the water and swim like a mermaid \u2013 I'm not so sure about that Neil \u2013 I don't really know how mermaids swim!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"There's more to it than that Rob. It's actually good for your fitness as Emma can explain\u2026"},{"author":"Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit","text":"It gives children's confidence in water a boost, it improves their water strength, it gives you an entire body workout. It works your cardiovascular system, it works your legs, your core \u2013 it improves the children's swimming technique, flexibility, balance, co-ordination \u2013 you get the reward, you get the social aspect \u2013 and alongside all of that, they're learning vital life skills along the way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So there are many benefits to mermaiding Rob. Improving confidence, strength, technique and it's good for your cardiovascular system \u2013 cardiovascular relates to your heart and blood vessels."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I like the sound of the social aspect \u2013 and by that Emma means being with other people and having fun. It's an activity that's sociable.  And it teaches life skills \u2013 useful skills that help you deal with everyday challenges. Well that's great for kids \u2013 and that's the problem."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What's that?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Mermaiding is for kids \u2013 so I can't get involved \u2013 even if I wanted to\u2026 can I?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You can Rob. According to Emma, it's growing in popularity with adults too \u2013 any excuse to live out your fantasies hey!"},{"author":"Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit","text":"There are so many adults that actually kind of want to live out their childhood dreams that they wanted to be a mermaid when they were children and they didn't get the opportunity and now it's here and now it's available and... So yes, we do a lot of adult classes as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There you go Rob \u2013 living out your childhood dreams \u2013 that doing things you wanted to do when you were a child. Like being a mermaid!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Sorry Neil, that wasn't a dream for me \u2013 although I did dream of swimming like a shark once! Anyway, mermaiding is a good form of aerobic exercise \u2013 but earlier I asked you what an example of anaerobic exercise is. Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said weightlifting. Was I right?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"You were Neil, well done. Any exercise that consists of short exertion, high-intensity movement is an anaerobic exercise \u2013 such as weight lifting, sprinting and jumping. I won't go into scientific detail \u2013 but aerobics exercise is done over a longer period of time and strengthens the heart and lungs, thereby improving the body's utilisation of oxygen."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks for that Rob. Now I think we should sprint through our recap of some of the words we've talked about today \u2013 starting with ' aerobic' , which you just explained. \"Mermaiding is a good aerobic workout.\""},{"author":"Rob","text":"Assuming you don't mind dressing up! Next we had ' aquatic' which refers to something connected with water. \"Synchronised swimming is an example of an aquatic sport.\""},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, you slipped in another of our words there \u2013 ' synchronised' \u2013 which means 'moving together at the same time or speed as someone or something else'. \"We synchronised our watches so that we all arrived at the same time.\""},{"author":"Rob","text":"Good idea \u2013 you're always late Neil. Then we mentioned ' mono' which means 'one' or 'single' and is used as a prefix on words such as 'monochrome' \u2013 one colour \u2013 or 'monorail' \u2013 a train running on a single track."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Then we heard the word ' cardiovascular' - a word that relates to the effect on your heart and lungs. \"Experts say those who quit smoking could also quickly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.\""},{"author":"Rob","text":"Finally, we also mentioned ' social' \u2013 this adjective relates to activities that you do with other people and are usually fun. \"Now I live in London, I have a great social life.\""},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well you never invite me out Rob!  Anyway, that's it for this edition of 6 Minute English. Before you rush off to fulfil your dream of being a mermaid, don't forget to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes and that's at bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye."}],"authors":["Rob","Neil","Emma Longden, founder,
