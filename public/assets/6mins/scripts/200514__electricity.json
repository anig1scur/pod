Well, their 1979 hit \u2018Highway to Hell\u2019 stayed at No.1 for eleven weeks\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, no, no - not that AC DC, Georgina! I\u2019m not talking rock music here, I\u2019m talking electrical currents \u2013 alternating current - AC, and direct current - DC, the two ways in which electricity flows."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Oh, I see. No, I don\u2019t know anything about that ACDC!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, don\u2019t worry because in today\u2019s programme we\u2019ll be finding out some quirky facts about electricity - how it differs across the world and why some countries have more complicated electrical systems than others."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmmm, I have noticed that when I travel to another country I need a converter plug to connect my laptop. Is that something to do with AC DC?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, it could be. Of course, electricity itself doesn\u2019t change from country to country."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"No. It\u2019s an invisible, natural force at work in everything from lightning storms to the electrical sparks firing our brains."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But although it happens naturally, one scientist was credited with discovering electricity. Who? That\u2019s my quiz question \u2013 who discovered electricity? Was it: a) Thomas Edison b) Alexander Graham Bell, or c) Benjamin Franklin"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I\u2019m not a qualified electrician myself, Neil, but I\u2019ll say c) Benjamin Franklin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well one person who definitely is a qualified electrician is BBC presenter Gareth Mitchell. So when BBC Radio 4\u2019s \u2018Science Stories\u2019 sent him to meet electricity expert Keith Bell, the conversation was, shall we say, sparky."},{"author":"Keith Bell","text":"Standard frequency in the US is 60 hertz, actually I think in the US on the mainland US, main continent, there are three different synchronous areas. So although it\u2019s around 60 hertz, at any moment in time these three different areas, because they\u2019re not connected to each other, will be going at a slightly different frequency. There are bigger differences elsewhere. So in Japan for example, I think one of the main islands is at 60 hertz and the other half of Japan is at 50 hertz."},{"author":"Gareth Mitchell","text":"That\u2019s a bit of a pickle!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Generally speaking, frequency means how often something repeats. In the case of electrical currents, frequency is the number of times an electrical wave repeats a positive-to-negative cycle."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It\u2019s measured in hertz (Hz). In the US power is at 60 hertz and in the UK it\u2019s around 50 hertz."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So the US and UK are not in the same synchronous area \u2013 not occurring together at the same time and rate, or in this case, frequency."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which means that to safely use a British electrical device in America, I need to convert the power supply. If not it won\u2019t work or even worse, it could break."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And a broken laptop could leave you in a bit of a pickle \u2013 an informal expression meaning a difficult situation with no obvious answer. Here\u2019s Gareth and Keith again talking about more differences."},{"author":"Gareth Mitchell","text":"I\u2019m pretty sure when I go to the United States, my electric toothbrush doesn\u2019t charge up at 60 hertz - 110 volts, but my laptop still works. Maybe you have no comment, Keith, but I\u2019m just saying\u2026one of these anomalies that I seem to have found."},{"author":"Keith Bell","text":"So, I\u2019m not sure about the electric toothbrush but I know a lot of our power supplies for laptops and stuff are solid state , you know - they\u2019ve got electronics in that do all the conversion for you, so basically it ends up with a DC supply into the machine itself. So there\u2019s a little converter in there and it\u2019s designed so it doesn\u2019t care what frequency the AC input is."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Gareth noticed that in the United States his toothbrush doesn\u2019t always fully charge up \u2013 get the power needed to make it work."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Electric toothbrushes which don\u2019t fully charge and differences between electrical frequencies are good examples of anomalies \u2013 things which are different from what is usual or expected."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But with modern technology these anomalies are becoming less and less commonplace. For example, computer companies have started making laptops with solid state electronics \u2013 electronics using semiconductors which have no moving parts and can automatically convert different electrical currents."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Meaning I can use my laptop to google the answer to your quiz question!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, yes. I asked you which scientist was credited with discovering electricity. And you said?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"c) Benjamin Franklin \u2013 and I already know I\u2019m right because I googled it on my solid state laptop! To show that lightning was electricity, Franklin attached a metal key to a kite and flew it during a thunderstorm. The key conducted electricity and gave him a shock!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm, not an experiment I recommend trying at home! Today we\u2019ve been talking about anomalies \u2013 or unexpected differences in electrical currents between countries."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Electrical currents are measured in frequencies \u2013 the number of times a wave repeats a positive-to-negative cycle. These can be different if two countries are not synchronous \u2013 occurring at the same rate, for example Britain and the United States."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Different frequencies may mean your electrical devices like your laptop, phone and toothbrush won\u2019t properly charge up \u2013 get the power to function, in other countries."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And having a phone with no power could leave you in a bit of a pickle - a difficult situation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Fortunately many modern devices use solid state electronics \u2013 non-moving semiconductors inside the machine which automatically convert the electrical current."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So you\u2019ll never miss another edition of 6 Minute English again!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for today.
