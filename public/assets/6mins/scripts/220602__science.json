This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Once in a while along comes a scientist who captures the public imagination and communicates their passion for science in an exciting and understandable way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be meeting one of America\u2019s best-known popular scientists. Astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson. He\u2019s a man with a gift for communicating and inspiring people with his television shows and books on cosmology \u2013 the study of the origin and nature of the universe."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In his day job he runs the Hayden Planetarium in New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History, but Neil\u2019s real mission is to encourage scientific thinking among the American public."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We\u2019ll be hearing from the famous astronomer, and learning some new vocabulary, soon. But first I have a question for you, Sam. Science is ever-changing with new discoveries updating our understanding all the time. For centuries, the Earth was thought to be the centre of the Universe - but who was the first astronomer to have the correct idea that, in fact, the Earth and the planets revolve around the Sun? a)    Nicolaus Copernicus b)    Isaac Newton c)    Galileo Galilei"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmm, I\u2019ll say it was c) Galileo."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Recent events like the Covid pandemic and climate crisis have put scientists under pressure from critics motivated by political views. Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks facts are not dependent on politics, but should be established with the scientific method, a process of finding the truth through testing and experimentation."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s Neil explaining more about the scientific method to BBC World Service programme, HardTalk."},{"author":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","text":"If you have a brilliant idea and you test it and it unearths so much of what has been known before, we\u2019re gonna double-check that \u2013 the rest of us \u2013 we\u2019ll say, \u2018But did he do it? Did he cross his t\u2019s and dot his i\u2019s ? Did he \u2026 Let me check the power that\u2019s driving his experiment, you know, the wall current, let me check how that was conceived and done\u2019. And if no-one can duplicate your results, it\u2019s not a result."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Before scientists can confirm the truth of an experiment, their findings must be doubled-checked - making certain something is correct by carefully examining it again. This process is called \u2018peer review\u2019 - other scientists double-checking the experiment to make sure everything was done correctly. One way they do this is to duplicate , or repeat, the experiment to see if they get the same result."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In other words, Neil wants scientists to have crossed the t\u2019s and dotted the i\u2019s , a phrase which means paying attention to the small details of whatever you are doing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A scientific approach requires an open mind and critical thinking, but Neil believes the most important thing is to know the difference between fact and opinion. People have opinions about all kinds of things but that doesn\u2019t make what they believe a fact."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yet fact and opinion are becoming harder to separate. As protests by anti-vaccine groups and climate change deniers have shown, many Americans, even presidents, seem suspicious of scientific fact. It\u2019s a worrying trend that Neil thinks is a result of the US education system, as he told BBC World Service programme, HardTalk."},{"author":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","text":"It has to do with how science is taught in schools. It\u2019s currently taught as a body of information, a satchel of facts that are imparted upon you and then you regurgitate that for an exam. That\u2019s an aspect of science, but it\u2019s not the most important part of science. The most important part of science is knowing how to question things and knowing when an answer has emerged that represents an objective truth about this world."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Neil says that science is taught by encouraging students regurgitate facts - to repeat information without properly understanding it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Knowledge is important, but what\u2019s also needed is a questioning attitude than can recognise objective truth - a truth about the natural world which is not influenced by human bias, opinions or emotion. Without that, anyone is free to call whatever they like a \u2018fact\u2019, which only leads to chaos."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right. No matter how hard I believe that the Moon is made of cheese, or the Sun goes round around the Earth, believing it doesn\u2019t make it true."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That sounds like something Neil deGrasse Tyson would agree with \u2013 and maybe Galileo too!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. In my question I asked who first came up with the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said it was Renaissance astronomer, Galileo."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which was the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. Galileo knew the Earth revolved around the Sun, but the first person with the idea was Polish astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus, in 1543 \u2013 unfortunately, centuries before the invention of television could spread the news of this objective truth \u2013 a provable truth which is uninfluenced by human bias or opinion."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the rest of the vocabulary from our chat about American scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson and his love of cosmology - the study of the Universe."},{"author":"Rob","text":"To double-check something means to make certain it\u2019s correct by carefully re-examining it. One way scientists do this is to duplicate , or repeat exactly, an experiment."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The idiom \u2018 cross the t\u2019s and dot the i\u2019s\u2019 means to pay close attention to the details of what you are doing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally, if you r egurgitate facts, you just repeat them without properly understanding them \u2013 something a true scientist would never do!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Sam","Rob","Neil deGrasse
