I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Rob","text":"As awful as the coronavirus pandemic has been, it\u2019s also highlighted the compassionate side of human nature - doctors and nurses helping the sick."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, and people helping out elderly relatives and neighbours, raising money for charity or wearing a face mask to keep others safe."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But the pandemic has also highlighted a more worrying issue called \u2018 compassion fatigue\u2019 . Have you heard of that, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, I think compassion fatigue is a kind of emotional exhaustion which reduces your ability to empathise or feel compassion for others."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, exactly, Sam. Compassion fatigue has long been a problem for people working in medical professions and is the topic of this programme."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ll be hearing how the suffering and unhappiness we see on the TV news can increase feelings of helplessness."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But first, let me ask you my quiz question, Sam. Humanitarian workers see human suffering on a daily basis and can easy fall victim to compassion fatigue. Founded in 1971, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res is one of the biggest humanitarian organisations. But what does M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res mean? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I remember newspapers calling it MSF and using its English name, which I think was, b) Doctors without borders."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out the answer later on. Compassion fatigue centres on the idea that we can feel too much empathy and that feeling can lead to emotional burnout."},{"author":"Sam","text":"According to psychologist, Margaret Heffernan, caring and fatigue are closely connected. Caring for others means taking on someone\u2019s pain yourself and this can have unhealthy consequences for the carer."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, here\u2019s Margaret Heffernan talking to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Documentary Podcast. See if you can hear the effects of compassion fatigue she mentions:"},{"author":"Margaret Heffernan","text":"As you find people spending more and more time online, reading more and more and more depressing news and they become more and more numb they also become more and more addicted to it. And this develops a kind of state of mind that is a kind of \u2026 it's a form of learned helplessness \u2013 because I\u2019m consuming something that\u2019s upsetting me but I cannot do anything about it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Margaret Heffernan mentions that spending too much time reading depressing online news can leave us feeling numb - unable to feel any emotions or think clearly because we are so upset or afraid."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The news exposes us to human suffering around the world which we feel powerless to help. This can lead to something which in psychology is called learned helplessness - giving up trying to feel better because your previous attempts have not worked."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This is all incredibly depressing, Rob! It sounds like we have limited amounts of compassion."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, there are more positive ways of looking at it, Sam. Here\u2019s an alternative view from Tom Rivett-Carnac, speaking with BBC World Service\u2019s, The Documentary Podcast."},{"author":"Tom Rivett-Carnac","text":"I understand why you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s finite \u2013 but I also think compassion is a habit. So dwelling with that, developing that habit - yes, there are a lot of headwinds to that and the rapid acceleration of the news cycle , the focus on the next problem so quickly draws our attention away from developing those deeper habits as humanity that gives us that courage and that strength to make these big transformations."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Like Margaret Heffernan, Tom Rivett-Carnac believes the news media is part of the problem."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Online newspapers and social media, speed up the news cycle - the reporting of a particular news story, from the first instance to the last."},{"author":"Sam","text":"As a result, we are constantly worrying about the next problem - and this can easily lead to emotional fatigue."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Tom emphasises compassion as a habit to be developed, instead of something finite \u2013 limited or having a fixed size."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But such compassionate habits can be difficult to cultivate because they face many headwinds - forces blowing in the opposite direction which stop you moving forward."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Headwinds such as the rapid news cycle which distracts us from developing compassion and courage. Maybe the answer is to help in whatever ways we can, without becoming hard-hearted \u2013 like the volunteers of MSF."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes - your quiz question, Rob. You asked what the French name M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res means in English. I said, b) Doctors without borders."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Well done! Doctors Without Borders offer volunteer medical assistance in the world\u2019s worst conflict zones."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Rob, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary, starting with compassion fatigue - emotional exhaustion which reduces your feelings of compassion."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This can leave you numb - unable to feel any emotions because you are so shocked or scared."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Learned helplessness is a psychological term for when someone stops trying to feel better because their previous attempts failed."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Some people believe that compassion is finite - limited or having a fixed size."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And it can be disturbed by the news cycle \u2013 the round of media reports and reactions to a news story."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which can be a headwind or opposing force, which stops us caring for others."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And that\u2019s it for this edition of 6 Minute
