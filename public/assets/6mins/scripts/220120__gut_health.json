This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

Are you a vegetarian, Neil? Do you follow any particular diet?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and only a little meat from time to time."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, while many diets claim to improve health or help you lose weight, recent research shows that what counts is not what you eat but how your body reacts ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, and that reaction doesn\u2019t happen where you might think \u2013 not in the brain, or tongue, or even the stomach, but in the gut \u2013 another name for the intestines - the long tube inside your body which digests food."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Inside everyone\u2019s gut are millions of microbes \u2013 tiny living organisms, too small to see without a microscope. Some of them are good for us, some bad."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Microbes help digest food, but they influence our bodies more than we know. Think of them as chemical factories that cause our individual reaction to the food we eat."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This mix of gut microbes is unique and different for everyone, even identical twins."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And it\u2019s the reason why some doctors now recommend a personalised diet, one that perfectly fits your own unique combination of microbes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Neil, and it\u2019s about the gut - the tube which includes the large and small intestine. It\u2019s very long - but how long exactly is the average adult\u2019s gut? Is it: a) 3.5 metres? b) 5.5 metres? or, c) 7.5 metres?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, everybody is different of course, but I\u2019ll say on average the gut is b) 5.5 metres long."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Among the first to investigate gut microbes was Dr Tim Spector, author of bestselling book, The Diet Myth. He wanted to check whether the dietary advice he had heard and believed, advice like \u2018eat little and often\u2019 or \u2018avoid fat\u2019, was really true."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Listen as Dr Spector explains how he started to doubt some of this advice - \u2018food myths\u2019, he calls them - to BBC Radio 4 programme, The Life Scientific:"},{"author":"Tim Spector","text":"All these so-called myths that I\u2019d believed, whether it was about calories , about fats, when to eat, how to eat, were based on flimsy or no evidence, very old, very poor quality, and had been repeated so much that people didn\u2019t think to question them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One of the food myths Dr Spector questioned was counting calories \u2013 the units which measure the amount of energy food provides."},{"author":"Sam","text":"He discovered that much of the dietary advice he had heard was either incorrect or based on flimsy evidence. If evidence is flimsy , it\u2019s weak and unconvincing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As Dr Spector questioned these food myths, he remembered an earlier study involving identical twins, pairs of brothers or sisters with the same genes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It was the surprising differences in weight between one twin and another that made Dr Spector realise that no two people have the same gut \u2013 even identical twins\u2019 guts are different."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But, as he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Life Scientific, the discovery came in a very smelly way \u2013 by asking his volunteers to send samples of their poo in the post!"},{"author":"Tim Spector","text":"We collected lots of these samples, sequenced them, and looked at twins where one was overweight and one was skinny \u2026 and we found in every case, the skinnier twin had a more diverse microbiome, greater numbers of different species and they also nearly always had high numbers of a couple of microbes that just stuck out of the crowd \u2013 and one was called christensenella and the other was called akkermansia."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Although genetically identical, one twin was overweight, while the other twin was skinny , or very thin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Because the weight difference could not be explained genetically, Dr Spector suspected the microbes in the skinnier twin\u2019s gut held the answer: the more diverse someone\u2019s microbes, the better their gut was at digesting food, regulating fat and maintaining health."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Two microbes, christensenella and akkermansia , were especially effective. Dr Spector says these microbes stuck out of the crowd , meaning they were easy to notice for their positive effect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And since everyone\u2019s microbes are different, it follows that a personalised diet which selects the friendliest food for your gut, is best. Right, and all this talk of eating is making me hungry, so tell me, Sam, was my answer to your question, right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, I asked about the length of the gut in the average adult."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said it was 5.5 metres."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Well done, Neil \u2013 that took \u2018guts\u2019, which is the second meaning of the word: courage."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned starting with gut \u2013 an informal word for the intestines, the tube which digests food from the stomach."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Microbes are microscopic organisms living inside the body."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A calorie is a unit measuring how much energy food provides."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If an argument or evidence is flimsy , it\u2019s weak and hard to believe."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A skinny person is very thin."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, if something sticks out of the crowd , it\u2019s noticeable in a good way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unfortunately, our six minutes are up, but remember: look after your gut, and your gut will look after you!
