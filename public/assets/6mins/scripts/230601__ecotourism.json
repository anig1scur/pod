This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth. Nowadays, the word \u2018safari\u2019 is often used negatively. For many people, the idea of killing animals for sport is unacceptable."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As the popularity of hunting declines, safaris are swapping their guns for cameras, offering tourists the chance to photograph wild animals in their natural habitat. In recent years, nature and wildlife tourism, also called ecotourism , has grown massively."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But the story is complex. While money from ecotourism is supposed to support threatened wildlife and traditional local cultures, the reality is sometimes different. In this programme, we\u2019ll be asking: is ecotourism good or bad? And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first I have a question for you, Beth. Most tourists on safari are looking for \u2018the big five\u2019, the name given to Africa's most iconic large animals. But which animals are \u2018the big five\u2019? Is it:"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I guess it\u2019s a) the lion, leopard, giraffe, baboon and buffalo."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. The balance between the good and bad things ecotourism can bring is well understood by Vicky Smith, whose website, Earth Changes, matches ecotourists with environmentally-friendly travel companies. Here is Vicky talking with BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth."},{"author":"Vicky Smith","text":"Just because tourism is nature-based, it doesn't mean to say it's necessarily responsible or sustainable . So, there's a lot of animal activities in tourism that we know which are, you know, highly irresponsible and unsustainable, like a performing whale and dolphin shows, or swimming with dolphins, elephant-riding, tiger selfies where the tigers are drugged."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Genuine ecotourism is sustainable \u2013 designed to continue at a steady level which does not damage the environment. Not every travel company which calls themselves eco-friendly acts sustainably, and may still advertise irresponsible tourist activities, including tiger selfies \u2013 having your photo taken with a captive wild tiger."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There are two requirements travel companies should meet to qualify as genuine ecotourism. First, tourists\u2019 main motivation should be to appreciate and observe the natural world without interfering, and second, the money they spend should support traditional communities. Clearly, having your photograph taken with a chained and drugged tiger does not meet these requirements."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But not all companies claiming to be ecotourism behave so irresponsibly. According to Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent, who runs small scale wildlife expeditions to some of the most remote places on Earth, it\u2019s possible to put travel companies on a sliding scale from good to bad. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme, Costing the Earth, Antonia discussed her work in Tajikistan, a country where ecotourism is making a positive impact on both animal and human communities."},{"author":"Antonia Bolingbroke Kent","text":"At the other end of the scale is Tajikistan, where I work a lot, which gets less than two dozen wildlife tourists a year, and the money these visitors bring is essential to the conservation work that grassroots NGOs are doing. So those few tourists\u2026 their money goes a very long way and the animals people are looking at\u2026 snow leopards, rare mountain ungulates like Bukharan markhor, they are being observed from a distance, their behaviour is not being affected in any way, and the local communities are genuinely benefiting."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Antonia uses the phrase at the other end of the scale as a way of contrasting irresponsible tourist companies with what\u2019s happening in Tajikistan. There, animals including snow leopards and mountain ungulates, are being protected by ecotourist projects run by non-governmental organisations, or NGOs - organizations trying to achieve environmental or social aims outside of government control. These NGOs are grassroots organisations meaning that they are run from the bottom up, by ordinary people rather than leaders."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Despite getting very few ecotourists a year, the money they spend in Tajikistan goes a long way , in other words, the money is an important factor in achieving their goals, which in Tajikistan at least, means protecting rare wild animals. OK, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question."},{"author":"Beth","text":"You asked me about \u2018the big five\u2019, the name for Africa\u2019s iconic safari animals. I guessed they were: the lion, leopard, giraffe, baboon and buffalo."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You guessed right about the lion, leopard, and buffalo, but the others were the rhinoceros and the elephant. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about ecotourism \u2013 travel to places of natural beauty where the tourists\u2019 motivation is to appreciate nature and support the local culture."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The adjective sustainable describes actions designed to continue at a steady level so as not to damage the environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A tiger selfie means having your photo taken with a captive wild tiger, not something to be advised!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"The phrase at the other end of the scale is similar in meaning to the phrase, \u2018by contrast\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A grassroots NGO is a non-governmental organisation which tries to achieve its aims through the actions of local ordinary people rather than leaders."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, if something goes a long way towards a certain goal, it\u2019s an important factor in achieving that goal.
