Now, Rachel Tobac, CEO of Social Proof Security, is an expert in cyber crime. She describes herself as an\u2019ethical fraudster\u2019. Businesses wanting to combat fraud employ her to hack into their computer systems to find their weak spots."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here, Rachel explains to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry, how getting people\u2019s information is the key to online fraud:"},{"author":"Rachel Tobac","text":"The reason why we\u2019re able to do that, from an attacker mindset , is because we use what\u2019s called OSINT \u2013 open source intelligence .

Rachel says they have options for how to do that. Login details stolen during a data breach from one company, often using software or viruses called malware , are used to infiltrate customer accounts at another."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To access people\u2019s data, fraudsters use cover stories \u2013 false stories told in order to hide the truth. For example, they may pretend to be calling from your bank or credit card company."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"If people believe these cover stories and share personal data, this can result in a data breach - an occasion when private information can be seen by people who should not be able to see it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Malware - computer software and viruses that are designed to damage the way a computer works \u2013 can also be used to gain login details and passwords\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"\u2026data which is then used to infiltrate other online accounts - secretly enter a place, group or organisation in order to spy on it or influence it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Modern fraudsters are so devious at collecting online information that many victims only realise what\u2019s happened after their bank accounts have been emptied."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which I guess was the mindset behind those British fraudsters you mentioned earlier, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, the nine men who tried to defraud the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme.
