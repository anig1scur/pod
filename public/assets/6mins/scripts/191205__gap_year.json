This is 6 Minute English and I'm Neil. And joining me to do this is Georgina."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hello."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, Georgina, I know you went to university to study for a degree but before you moved from college to university, did you take a year off?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I did."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you\u2019re not alone. Many students choose to take a break from their studies to travel or gain work experience before moving on to university."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, and this is what we call a \u2018 gap year\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And \u2026 in this programme we\u2019re talking about taking a gap year and why doing this has become more important than ever. But first, as always, I need to challenge you and our listeners, Georgina, to answer a question. Are you ready?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ready and waiting, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which subject studied at university will lead to the highest average earnings five years after graduating? Is it\u2026 a) Law b) Veterinary science, or c) Medicine and dentistry What do you think, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, all are subjects that involve lots of studying \u2013 but as a guess, I think those studying veterinary science end up working as vets and earning the most money \u2013 so it\u2019s b), I think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. Let's get back to talking about gap years \u2013 as the name suggests, it\u2019s a break or gap in between your studies \u2013 we might also call it a year out. It\u2019s not a new concept \u2013 meaning idea \u2013 and there are a number of reasons why someone may choose to take one."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s right. The BBC\u2019s Smart Consumer podcast looked at this and heard from two students \u2013 one, Meg, took a gap year and the other, Tom, didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s hear from them now\u2026"},{"author":"Students \u2013 Meg and Tom","text":"Meg: I knew I wanted to go to university, but... I decided I'll do it after a year out. That way I can wait till I get my official results and apply to university with those rather than getting predicted grades and then, you know, potentially being surprised and not being able to follow the path I wanted. I just always had in the back my mind that I'd spend a year doing something productive and something that would just be good fun. Tom: It's not something that I really knew about to be honest, I think, until I started university. It was a bit of an alien concept to me. It's something I've never thought about - it would have been far too expensive and it's not something that would have been able to rely on my parents or family members for."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Two different experiences there. So Meg said she had \u2018 in the back of my mind\u2019 doing a gap year. That means she had the idea but didn\u2019t think about it frequently \u2013 it was stored deep in her memory."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And she had the idea of doing something productive \u2013 that means leading to a good or useful outcome \u2013 and, of course, having fun at the same time!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"She also wanted to do something while she waited for her exam results to come in, rather than applying for a university place based on predicted results which may turn out to be wrong. If something is predicted , it\u2019s an estimation of what is likely to happen in the future based on current information."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Now, Tom had a different experience. He wasn\u2019t really aware of the gap year and described it as an alien concept \u2013 so an idea that is strange and not familiar."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tom also mentioned a gap year would have been too expensive \u2013 but according to Chris Rea from the organisation Prospects, it needn\u2019t cost a lot of money. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours programme, he says it\u2019s about gaining skills and being more employable\u2026"},{"author":"Chris Rea, Higher Education Services Manager, Prospects","text":"I think the experience of the gap year has become actually much more practical , partly as I say to do with university participation increasing, but also because of the demands on developing skills, specifically employability skills. A ctually from an employer\u2019s point of view, certainly, any form of experience and skills acquisition that you've undertaken is valuable."},{"author":"Neil","text":"According to Chris Rea, the focus these days is for a gap year to be more practical \u2013 this adjective describes the learning of real skills which can be usefully applied."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, and these are skills that help you compete for a place at university and ultimately make you more employable - they help you get a job."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, but which job might earn you the most money Georgina? Earlier I asked you, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which subject studied at university will lead to the highest average earnings, five years after graduating? Is it\u2026 a) Law b) Veterinary science, or c) Medicine and dentistry What do you say, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said veterinary science. Was I correct?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sadly you weren\u2019t. The correct answer is c) Medicine and dentistry. According to research in the UK, graduates of medicine and dentistry earn an average of \u00a346,700."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s more than an English teacher I suspect, but that\u2019s not going to stop us recapping today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. So, we\u2019ve been talking about a gap year \u2013 that's a year between leaving school and starting university that is usually spent travelling or working."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When we say something is at the back of my mind , we mean an idea we don\u2019t think about frequently but keep stored deep in our memory."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And when something is productive \u2013 it describes something that leads to a good or useful outcome."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Next, we mentioned the word predicted . If something is predicted , it\u2019s an estimation of what is likely to happen in the future based on current information."},{"author":"Neil","text":"An alien concept is an idea that is strange and not familiar."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And when you\u2019re doing something practical , you\u2019re doing something that is real and useful because you learn skills that can be used in the future."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thank you, Georgina, for that practical run through of our vocabulary. So that\u2019s all from 6 Minute English for now.
