I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s it."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re correct at the end of the programme. John Drury is a researcher from Sussex University. On the BBC Radio 4 series All in The Mind he spoke about yawning and why it is contagious. Which animal does he mention will also catch a yawn from its owner?"},{"author":"John Drury","text":"Yawning is actually a difficult case when it comes to these contagious behaviours. It is the most contagious behaviour \u2013 it\u2019s meant to be automatic, it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t stop. Dogs yawn when their owners yawn, animals yawn to each other. It happens whether you want to or not. These kind of effects have been found for other kinds of behaviour, so really, we were trying to push it as far as we could and see if there is a cognitive element to this influence behaviour."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which animal might yawn when its owner does?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dogs! Dogs can catch a yawn from their owners."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, yawning is a very contagious behaviour. The use of the word behaviour here is interesting. Normally it is an uncountable noun to describe the way we act \u2013 either in a good or a bad way. We talk about, for example, dogs' or children\u2019s behaviour being good or bad."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But it\u2019s also used as an uncountable noun when we are talking about a particular action that, for example, an animal makes in particular situations. These behaviours are often not conscious, but are an automatic response to a situation."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And the researchers were looking to see if there was a cognitive side to the behaviour. Which means they are looking at the mental process \u2013 what is happening in the mind to make us yawn, particularly when someone else yawns. Let\u2019s listen again"},{"author":"John Drury","text":"Yawning is actually a difficult case when it comes to these contagious behaviours.

Here\u2019s John Drury again."},{"author":"John Drury","text":"So, the more that you identify with the in-group target, the more likely you are to copy their behaviour. What we do when we see a behaviour is that at some level, we are making a judgement about whether the person exhibiting that behaviour, whether it\u2019s an emotion, or a scratching behaviour, or anything, is relevant. Does their behaviour indicate to us how we should behave?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, essentially, yawning is more contagious if we identify with the person who yawns first. If we feel close to, and belong in, the same group as the person who exhibits the behaviour \u2013 the person who does the yawning \u2013 we are likely to yawn too."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, you are less likely to yawn if a stranger yawns than if someone in your close family or circle of friends yawns."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Let\u2019s listen again."},{"author":"John Drury","text":"So, the more that you identify with the in-group target, the more likely you are to copy their behaviour.

Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I was pretty sure it\u2019s A - to take in more oxygen."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"There is, in fact, no clear biological reason for yawning that is agreed upon. So no one really knows."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We\u2019ve been talking about yawning. The action of opening our mouths wide open and stretching our eardrums when tired or bored."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yawning can also be contagious.
