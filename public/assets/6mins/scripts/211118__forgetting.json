Can you remember people\u2019s names, or where you left your car keys?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I can remember people\u2019s faces, but I have a terrible memory for names. And sometimes I\u2019ll be eagerly reading a book but then a week later I can\u2019t remember a single thing about it!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, you\u2019re not alone. Many people find it hard to remember things they\u2019ve read or learned while other, sometimes useless, information sticks with them."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be finding out why we forget the things we\u2019ve learned, whether that\u2019s someone\u2019s name, a word in English or where you put your wallet."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But first let me ask you my quiz question, Rob - before I forget. You and I might struggle to remember someone\u2019s phone number but Chinese student, Chao Lu, has a record-breaking memory. In 2005, she recited the numbers of pi, the mathematical equation describing the proportions of a circle \u2013 but how many digits did she manage to remember? Was it: a)    48,000? b)    68,000?  or c)    88,000?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Wow! It sounds like Chao Lu has an incredible memory! I\u2019ll say she remembered b) 68,000 digits of pi."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, Rob, let\u2019s remember to find out the answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, will do. Someone like Chao Lu might have a photographic memory \u2013 the ability to remember things in exact detail, like looking at a photograph. But for the rest of us, things are more complicated."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Dr Jared Horvath is an educational neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne. According to him, there are two rules which explain how we remember information."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Listen to Dr Horvath talking to BBC World Service programme, The Why Factor, and see if you can hear the two rules he mentions:"},{"author":"Dr Jared Horvath","text":"Rule number one is repetition is key. The odds of remembering something after a one-off are incredibly slim\u2026unless you can immediately link it to something you already understand \u2013 so, my middle name is Cuney\u2026 if I ever meet someone named Cuney I\u2019ll never forget that \u2018cos I have an immediate link\u2026 but if I meet someone named Joe\u2026 so a one-off, we all pretty much suck at it - unless we focus. So then rule two then becomes, we remember what we focus on."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The first rule for remembering is repetition. The odds \u2013 meaning the probability, of remembering something are low if you learn it as a one-off - something that only happens once."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dr Horvath\u2019s second rule is about focus: we remember what we focus on. This involves making links between new information and something you already understand."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"These are the most effective methods of remembering, and most of us suck at \u2013 or are bad at \u2013 other ways of remembering things."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now, of course, one group of people who need good memory is students. Do you remember cramming for school exams, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah yes, staying up late trying to revise everything the night before an exam. I remember doing that - but it didn\u2019t work!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. Dr Horvath\u2019s research found that students who cram for tests forget around 90% of what they studied within 72 hours."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"He thinks education shouldn\u2019t be about trying to cram students\u2019 heads with facts and figures. It should involve something more meaningful, as he explains to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Why Factor:"},{"author":"Dr Jared Horvath","text":"The thing that I like about education is its really moving from a model of  \u2018just memorise as much as you can\u2019 into what we now call deep learning which is, instead of giving you a hundred things and I just need to know that you can remember them, I\u2019m going to give you ten things and instead of just being able to remember them, I want you to be able to describe it deeply and come up with new ways of looking at it."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Traditionally, education involves memorising \u2013 learning information exactly as it is so that you can repeat it later."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But being able to repeat something like a parrot doesn\u2019t always mean you understand it. Dr Horvath advocates a technique called deep learning \u2013 a complete way of learning something that means you fully understand and will not forget it."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, remember: repetition, focus and deep learning are the memory muscles we need. Maybe that\u2019s how Chinese student, Chau Lu, developed her record-breaking memory. You do remember your quiz question, don\u2019t you, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, thank you, Rob - my memory isn\u2019t that bad! I asked you how many digits of the mathematical equation, pi, she could remember."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I said b) 68,000 digits."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Actually, the number was so long it took her over 24 hours without a break to recite it all!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh Wow! Her brain must have be aching after all that. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with a photographic memory which is the ability to remember things in exact detail, like looking at a photograph."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"The odds of something happening mean the chances that it will happen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A one-off is something that only happens once."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"To suck at something is an informal way to say \u2018be bad at doing something\u2019. It\u2019s more common in American English."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If you memorise something, you learn it exactly so that you can repeat it later."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And finally, deep learning describes a complete way of learning something so that you fully understand it and will not forget it."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well, that\u2019s all from us, but don\u2019t forget to join us again soon for more trending topics and top tips to help you remember useful and everyday English vocabulary.
