This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Sleep \u2013 we all need it \u2013 some more than others. I can usually get by with around seven hours a night but I do like to have a nap \u2013 a short sleep \u2013 in the afternoon, when I\u2019m not working of course. How about you, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m always tired and as soon as my head hits the pillow, I\u2019m out like a light \u2013 meaning I go to sleep very quickly."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, Neil, you might not survive in South Korea then. Apparently, it\u2019s one of the most stressed and tired nations on earth - a place where people work and study longer hours and get less sleep than anywhere else. We\u2019ll find out more later and teach some sleep-related vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before we do, you need to give me a question to keep me awake and alert!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course I do, and here it is. In the 1960s, American man, Randy Gardner, set the world record for staying awake for the longest period. Do you know what that time was? Was it: a)    64 hours b)    164 hours, or c)    264 hours?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"All sound impossible but I\u2019ll guess a) 64 hours \u2013 that\u2019s nearly 3 days!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oh, well. I\u2019ll give you the answer later in the programme \u2013 assuming you don\u2019t doze off! But let\u2019s talk more about sleep now. As I mentioned, we all need it to help our mind and body rest and relax. And going without sleep \u2013 or sleeplessness - is bad for our health."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many things can stop us sleeping and some of them are pressure, anxiety and stress caused by your job. And in South Korea research has shown it\u2019s become increasingly difficult to switch off \u2013 stop thinking about work and relax. South Koreans sleep fewer hours and have higher rates of depression and suicide than almost anywhere else."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Se-Woong Koo has been reporting on this for the BBC World Service Documentary podcast. He met one worker who explained why she never got time to relax."},{"author":"Se-Woong Koo, BBC reporter","text":"Separating work and rest time has been a recurring issue for Ji-an \u2013 in her last job her office hours were long. Like most Korean firms, her employer didn\u2019t think about any boundaries. They encroached on almost all her time."},{"author":"Korean office worker","text":"They told me \u2018you need to be contactable 24/7\u2019 \u2013 there will always be someone from work reaching out to me, like needing to get something done right now. Even just thinking about it, I get really agitated ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, that stressed out worker got agitated just thinking about the situation \u2013 she got worried or upset. That\u2019s because office hours in South Korea are long and some employers expect their workers to be contactable all the time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, there are no boundaries \u2013 so no limits or rules about when employers can contact their employees. Therefore, as this employee said, work encroached \u2013 it gradually took over - her leisure time. Stress like this can lead to insomnia \u2013 a condition where you are unable to sleep."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The BBC Discovery podcast goes on to explain that offering a cure for this sleeplessness has become big business. There are sleep clinics where doctors assess people overnight, and sleep cafes that offer places to nap in the middle of the working day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One other issue in South Korea that\u2019s affecting sleep is the \u2018bali bali\u2019 culture, meaning \u2018quickly, quickly\u2019 or \u2018hurry, hurry\u2019. People are constantly in a rush."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Doctor Lee spoke to the World Service\u2019s Discovery podcast about the effects of this and how even trying to take medication to help sleep, has its problems."},{"author":"Dr Lee","text":"People take like, ten or twenty pills per one night, and because they cannot fall asleep even with the medication, they drink alcohol on top of that, and they experience side-effects of the medication. People can sleepwalk , and go to the refrigerator, eat a lot of things unconsciously - uncooked food, and they don\u2019t remember next day. There were cases of car accidents in the centre of Seoul which has been sleepwalking patients."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, some people are taking lots of pills to help them sleep but they\u2019re not working so they\u2019re drinking alcohol as well. This leads to side-effects \u2013 unpleasant and unexpected results from the medication."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It seems, one of these side-effects is sleepwalking \u2013 moving around and doing things while still asleep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if sleeping pills aren\u2019t working, there\u2019s always meditation \u2013 or working less."},{"author":"Sam","text":"At least South Koreans are getting some sleep, unlike Randy Gardner who I asked you about earlier."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, he holds the record for staying awake the longest. And I thought he stayed awake for 64 hours. Was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"No, Neil. Not long enough. Randy Gardner stayed awake for an incredible 264.4 hours \u2013 that\u2019s 11 days and 25 minutes \u2013 in January 1964."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s one record I really don\u2019t want to beat."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, before you nod off Neil, let\u2019s recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve been discussing, including go out like a light , which means you go to sleep very quickly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When you switch off you stop concentrating on one thing and start thinking about something else."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A lack of sleep or rest can make you agitated \u2013 you get worried or upset."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Encroach means gradually take over."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When you take medication and it gives you an unpleasant and unexpected result, we call these side-effects ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And sleepwalking describes moving around and doing things while still asleep."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s our six minutes up.
