I'm Rob\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2026 and I'm Neil. Hello."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hello, Neil! I watched that space movie last night \u2013 the one where those astronauts are stranded in space."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Stranded means stuck in a place with only a small chance of leaving. Gravity , you mean?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That's the one. And this year marks the 50th anniversary of the first ever space walk. On 18th March 1965 Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was the first man to drift free in space \u2013 500km from the surface of Earth. And that\u2019s the subject of today\u2019s show!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"What on earth must that have felt like?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah ha! Exactly. It would have felt like nothing on earth \u2013 and that\u2019s to say, very strange indeed. He was the first person to experience the colourful geography of our planet stretched out before him."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Very poetic, Rob! But moving on, how about answering today\u2019s quiz question: How long did the first space walk last? Was it..."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hmm. All quite short \u2013 so I think I\u2019ll go for the one in the middle \u2013 12 minutes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, \u2018cosmonaut\u2019 literally means \u2018sailor of the universe\u2019. But Leonov\u2019s mission wasn\u2019t plain sailing \u2013 in other words, it wasn\u2019t easy or straightforward."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s right.  No one had ever gone out into space before \u2013 it was unknown territory \u2013 unknown territory means a place or activity that people do not know anything about or have not experienced before. And as it happens, there were big problems."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When Leonov left the capsule his spacesuit inflated \u2013 or swelled up \u2013 like a balloon because the pressure inside the suit was greater than outside.  This made it impossible for Leonov to get back through the door of the spacecraft, putting him in a life-threatening situation."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Let\u2019s listen to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, talking about it."},{"author":"Helen Sharman, first Briton in space","text":"So he decreases the pressure of his suit, which means that it\u2019s a bit more able to move inside it, but it means the amount of oxygen he\u2019s got around his face is now dangerously low so he can\u2019t cope with that for very long. So if he\u2019s not able to get in quickly, he\u2019s going to die of oxygen starvation, um [\u2026] so he had the presence of mind to get on with all of this, got back in, swivelled himself round, managed to close the airlock, and then when the pressure was equilibrated was finally able to, you know, hug his compatriot up there in space."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, if you can\u2019t cope with something it means you are unable to deal successfully with a difficult situation. And here the situation was having very little oxygen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But Leonov had the presence of mind to find a solution. Presence of mind means being able to react quickly and stay calm in a difficult or dangerous situation."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And if I was in Leonov\u2019s shoes \u2013 meaning if I was in his situation \u2013 I would have panicked big time!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And there was plenty more to panic about before the mission was over. The spacecraft\u2019s automatic re-entry system failed so the cosmonauts had to fire the rockets manually \u2013 meaning controlled by hand \u2013 which they had never done before."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s not all. Their capsule failed to detach \u2013 or separate \u2013 from the spacecraft\u2019s equipment module, and this sent them tumbling through space towards Earth."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But the capsule did finally detach. And then you would think they\u2019d have been home and dry, wouldn\u2019t you? Home and dry means being close to achieving a goal."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, they certainly weren\u2019t dry. The capsule touched down \u2013 or landed \u2013 hundreds of kilometres off course in freezing Siberia populated only by wolves and bears. Leonov had sweated so much on the space walk that his boots were filled with water up to his knees! Both cosmonauts had to wring out \u2013 or twist and squeeze \u2013 their clothes to avoid frostbite."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And off course , by the way, means not following the right route. Those men must have been overjoyed when they were finally airlifted to safety two days later!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"But what seems unfair to me is, we all know about the Apollo moon landing, but how many of us know about the first space walk?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, at least we do now, and of course our listeners do too!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s have the answer to the quiz question. I asked: How long did the first space walk last? Was it\u2026 a) 2 minutes b) 12 minutes or c) 22 minutes?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said a) 12 minutes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And you were right!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Excellent. Good! So 12 minutes eh? What an amazing short stroll that must have been but a very historic one too."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well done. Now, can we hear today\u2019s words again please?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. We heard:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s the end of today's 6 Minute English. We thought it was out of this world \u2013 hope you thought so too! Please join us again soon."},{"author":"Both","text":"Bye."}],"authors":["Rob","Neil","Helen Sharman, first Briton in
