This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Would you say you\u2019re artistic, Sam? Can you draw or paint? Do you dance or play music?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I play the piano a bit. Yes, I\u2019d say I\u2019m quite artistic. How about you, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if you count playing football as artistic then yes, but basically no \u2013 I can\u2019t paint."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019ve been wondering why artistic ability comes more naturally to some people than others, so in this programme we\u2019ll be asking: are artists\u2019 brains different? We\u2019ll hear two expert opinions, and as usual, we\u2019ll learn some useful new vocabulary as well. So, what do you think, Neil? Are artists\u2019 brains different from other people\u2019s?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m not sure, Sam, but it\u2019s true that many artists behave differently, often in very strange ways. For example, did you know that Michelangelo worked so hard he never took a bath! Or that guitar legend, Jimi Hendrix, once set fire to his guitar on stage!"},{"author":"child prodigy","text":"We\u2019ll hear more about the artist\u2019s brain soon, but first I have a question for you. As you said, artistic ability comes naturally to some people, including the famous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart was considered a  - a young child with very great musical talent. So, how old was Mozart when he composed his first piece of music? Was he: a) five years old? b) ten years old? or, c) fifteen years old?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019ll guess he was a) five years old."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. If artists\u2019 brains are different, it could mean they see the world in unusual ways. Dr Rebecca Chamberlain is a researcher in the neuroscience of art. She investigates how artists see the objects they are drawing by measuring saccades \u2013 the rapid movements our eyes make as they jump from one thing to another. Here she shares her findings with BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience."},{"author":"Rebecca Chamberlain","text":"Artists seem to be processing the visual world in a different way to non-artists, particularly when they\u2019re drawing. The artist actually takes a more global approach to looking \u2013 so they make bigger saccades, bigger eye movements, and shorter fixations on the image. So, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re getting much more of a kind of gist level view of the thing they\u2019re looking at."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Rebecca\u2019s experiments seem to confirm that artists\u2019 brains work differently because of their processing of the visual world \u2013 the way their brains make sense of information. Interestingly, processing also means the act of developing pictures from photographic film."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When they draw, artists make bigger, quicker eye movements so they are able to see the whole picture, something also known as the gist \u2013 the overall, general impression of something without focussing on the details. If you \u2018get the gist\u2019 of what someone is saying, you understand the overall meaning of what they say, but not the details."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The second expert to answer our question about the artistic brain is Mike, a BBC World Service listener from Malawi. Mike is a self-taught painter who creates large, colourful pictures in his studio. According to him, artistic ability isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with - it can be learned, as he explained to BBC World Service\u2019s, CrowdScience."},{"author":"Arts teacher Mike","text":"I had this other student\u2026 he was really at the zero, like, he could not draw \u2013 at all. So, I gave him some tips, and in a month, he was really good \u2013 he was like really surprised, blown away , he never expected it. So, there are some things that are trainable , it\u2019s like a bike. In my case, I learned how to do those things without anyone telling me, you know like, if you are drawing the face, the human face, the distance between your eyes is the same as one of your eyes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Mike gives tips to his students \u2013 helpful pieces of advice about how to do something, in this case, to paint. After getting Mike\u2019s tips, one of his students really improved and started painting much better. Mike was blown away \u2013 an informal way to say very impressed or surprised."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Like learning to ride a bike, Mike thinks that painting is trainable \u2013 a word from American English meaning that it can be taught or trained. For him, this is proof that artists\u2019 brains are not so different after all."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, there we have it \u2013 two different options, but no final answer to our question. Still, some scientists think there may be third possibility: everyone\u2019s brain works by focussing on some areas and ignoring others, making a kind of jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. Maybe all of us \u2013 you, me, Mozart and Jimi Hendrix - are just filling in the missing pieces our own way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Speaking of Mozart, Neil, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. I asked how old child prodigy Mozart was when he first composed music."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said he was five years old\u2026 so, was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Your answer was correct! Mozart was five when first wrote music, and by the age of six he had performed in front of the Emperor of Austria \u2013 twice! Now there\u2019s an artistic brain!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with child prodigy - a young child, like Mozart, with a great talent in something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Processing describes how your brain makes sense of the information it receives."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The gist of something is a general understanding of it, without the details."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tips are useful pieces of advice about how to do something better."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you are blown away , you are very impressed or surprised by something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, trainable means able to be trained or taught, in American English."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Once again, our six minutes are up. It\u2019s goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Sam","child prodigy","Rebecca Chamberlain","Arts teacher
