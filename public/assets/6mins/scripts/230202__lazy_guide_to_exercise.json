This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam. Did you make any New Year\u2019s resolutions this year, Neil? They\u2019re  promises that you make to yourself to do something positive in the coming year\u2026 And now that we\u2019re into February, it\u2019s getting harder to keep those promises!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, the same promises I make every year, Sam \u2013 to exercise more and get fit. But I\u2019m too lazy to go running on cold winter mornings - I\u2019d rather stay in bed!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Are you feeling out of shape after Christmas, like Neil? Maybe you want to be more active but can\u2019t find the time? If so, this programme is for you!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, in this lazy person\u2019s guide to exercise, we\u2019ll be asking: what is the least amount of exercise someone can get away with doing whilst still staying healthy? And, of course, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Of course, any exercise is better than none. \u2018Structured exercise\u2019 - activities like going to a fitness class, or swimming are great. But if that\u2019s not possible, we\u2019ll be hearing about small changes you can make that will help as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is good news because fewer and fewer of us of doing what the UK government recommends - thirty minutes of moderate exercise a day. In fact, the government recently downgraded its recommendations because so few Brits were following it. So, Sam, according to new government advice, what is the minimum number of steps we should walk every day to stay healthy? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019ll say a) five thousand steps per day."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam. We\u2019ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Someone else who\u2019s interested in how little exercise he can do is BBC reporter, James Gallagher. Here\u2019s James speaking with sports physiologist, Dr Zoe Saynor, after Zoe had been monitoring James\u2019s fitness while running on a treadmill for BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science."},{"author":"Dr Zoe Saynor","text":"\u2026 I also know you do regularly try and do structured exercise."},{"author":"James Gallagher","text":"Just to be clear, my structured exercise training is going for a swim once a week."},{"author":"Zoe","text":"Generally, that's fantastic! I guess my question to you would be, how hard do you push yourself when you go swimming?"},{"author":"James","text":"Not as hard as the treadmill."},{"author":"Zoe","text":"I think the big thing if we come back to this question of what is the least I can do? There's clear evidence that if you want to do shorter exercise sessions, they need to be of a higher intensity, right?"},{"author":"James","text":"So there's a trade-off."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Zoe says that if you don\u2019t have much time to exercise it\u2019s okay to do shorter sessions, as long as you push yourself \u2013 try harder and put more effort into what you\u2019re doing. If you can swim a length in forty seconds, push yourself to swim it in thirty-five."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That means exercising harder of course, but for a shorter time. In other words, there\u2019s a trade-off \u2013 you accept the disadvantages of something in order to get the benefit it brings."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Another problem for many people is that their job is sedentary \u2013 it involves little exercise or physical activity. Zoe thinks it\u2019s important that office workers who sit down all day also find time to exercise. Here she shares her tips with BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health."},{"author":"Dr Zoe Saynor","text":"Especially people who have office jobs are sat down all day, we then look at some of the easy wins . So, active travel, and even if that's parking a little bit further away. One of the exciting areas in the literature that's coming out at the moment, is actually walking faster. So, if you have no time to suddenly do 10,000 steps a day, can we get you to do 5,000 steps faster? Will we see an improvement on your health? Yes, we will see an improvement on your health, especially over a longer period of time. The big focus around short, sharp exercise sessions is you get more bang for your buck."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Zoe\u2019s suggestions for active travel, things like walking from the car, and using the stairs instead of the lift, are easy wins - tasks that are both easy to accomplish and bring benefits."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Easy wins, like short but intensive bursts of exercise, increase fitness and give you more bang for your buck , and idiom which means that you get better results for the same amount of effort you put in. That\u2019s something everyone can appreciate \u2013 even you, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019ll definitely try to walk more, but remember, Sam, the body needs rest too!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And speaking of walking, isn\u2019t it  time to reveal the answer to your question: how many steps does the UK government recommend we should walk a day? I guessed it was five thousand\u2026 So, was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were close, Sam, but in fact the correct answer is ten thousand steps a day, although as Zoe mentioned, walking fewer steps faster has benefits too. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from our lazy guide to exercise, starting with New Year\u2019s resolution \u2013 a promise you make to yourself to do positive things in the coming year."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When you push yourself , you put more effort into what you\u2019re doing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In a trade-off , you accept the disadvantages of something in order to get the benefits as well. \u2018Trade-off\u2019 can also be used as a verb."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The adjective, sedentary , describes something which involves little exercise or physical activity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"An easy win is a task that is both easy to accomplish and brings positive results."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, the idiom more bang for your buck , means you get a better outcome for the same amount of effort you put into something. We hope your New Year\u2019s resolutions have made it into February! If there\u2019s just one you keep, make it joining us again soon for more topical chat here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Sam","Dr Zoe Saynor","James
