This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sam, would you describe yourself as \u2018sporty\u2019?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I do like to go running and I might watch some sport on TV."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Would you watch sport like bandy, skeleton or perhaps luge?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah, you\u2019re talking about quite specialised sports, played on ice or snow, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s almost time for the Winter Olympics."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, you\u2019re right. The 2022 Winter Olympics starts in Beijing on the 4th February. This event will mark the return of the Olympics to Beijing for the first time in 14 years, having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Games."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That means Beijing will become the first city in the world to have hosted both the Winter and Summer Games. But these latest Games are not without controversy \u2013 that\u2019s disagreement or argument about something people have strong feelings about."},{"author":"Neil","text":"More about that later \u2013 but as usual, I have a question or you, Sam. The Winter Olympics have not been around as long as the Summer Olympics, so do you know when the first Winter event took place? Was it in: a)    1904 b)    1924, or c)    1934?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, as they are relatively new, I\u2019ll go for c) 1934."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right later in the programme. Now, this latest Winter Olympics are scheduled to include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports - biathlon, bobsledding, curling, ice hockey, luge, skating and skiing. A discipline in this context is a particular way of doing a sport."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, went to a recent test event for the Olympics and explained what the organisers are hoping for\u2026"},{"author":"Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent","text":"In the mountains outside Beijing, the test events are in full swing . (The) Games organisers will be hoping (that) despite the coronavirus headaches , despite the alleged human rights abuses, despite the allegations from a former Chinese Olympian - a tennis star at that - involving a senior government official - they can still produce a memorable Winter Olympics."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So that was Stephen McDonell at a test event which he described as being in full swing \u2013 so, at its highest level or activity \u2013 its busiest. And he mentioned the controversy surrounding the games."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, he mentioned the coronavirus headache \u2013 not an actual headache but something that causes a lot of problems. Covid-19 certainly makes it difficult to plan a huge event like this, particularly managing people who are travelling from all parts of the world."},{"author":"Neil","text":"On top of this, China is accused of human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslims. And there is the controversy around the tennis player, Peng Shuai."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But despite the issues facing the game\u2019s organisers, they want to put on an event that is hard to forget, for good reasons \u2013 Stephen used the word memorable ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, seeing athletes hurtle down an icy track at 130 kilometres an hour on what looks like a tea tray, is certainly unforgettable. This is what they call \u2018the skeleton\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Let\u2019s hear more about the preparations for the games from the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonell."},{"author":"Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent","text":"The games will be held in a freezing, mostly dry area - a mountain of snow making is required, but this can make for quick, dynamic runs. The athletes we spoke to said these sites will make for high-quality competition - for everyone here, the clock is now ticking ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, despite this being a winter event, held in a cold place, enormous quantities of artificial snow have to be made. Stephen McDonell describes this as a mountain of snow \u2013 not a real mountain \u2013 but a large amount of it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But some athletes say this type of snow is good for speed, and changing and developing \u2013 or dynamic \u2013 conditions. They hope it will be a \u2018high-quality\u2019 competition."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s hope so, and it\u2019s not long until it starts \u2013 and for the athletes the clock is ticking , meaning time is running out to prepare."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And our time is running out too, so Neil, what\u2019s the answer to the question you asked me?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh yes, I asked you when the first Winter Olympics took place?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said 1934."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 I\u2019m afraid to say, Sam, the wrong answer. The first Winter Olympic Games took place in 1924 and were held in Chamonix in the French Alps. The Beijing Winter Olympics is the 24th games. And the Paralympic Games will take place a month later in the city, between 4th and 13th March 2022."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Looks like I need to brush up on my Winter Olympics knowledge but not before we recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned, starting with controversy \u2013 disagreement or argument about something people have strong feelings about."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We talked about something being in full swing \u2013 so, at its highest level of activity."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And a headache is, metaphorically, something that causes you a lot of problems."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A mountain is not only a very high hill - used metaphorically it means a large amount of something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Something continually changing and developing can be described as dynamic ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, the clock is ticking , means time is running out to prepare for or complete something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, the clock is no longer ticking for us because our six minutes are up!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bye bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Sam","Stephen McDonell, BBC
