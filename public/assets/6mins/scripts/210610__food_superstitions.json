Quick, throw some over your left shoulder."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Throw salt over my shoulder?! What are you talking about, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s bad luck to spill salt!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oh dear! It looks like Rob believes in superstitions - old beliefs which are based on magic and mystery rather than science. Many superstitions are connected to food, as we\u2019ll discover in this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right - like throwing salt over your shoulder to stop bad luck."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oh come on, Rob! You don\u2019t really believe that, do you?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, lots of people do believe food superstitions, including otherwise rational, scientific people. For example, have you ever blown out the candles on a birthday cake and made a wish? Or thrown rice over the bride and groom at a wedding?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes to both of those. Maybe I\u2019m more superstitious than I thought!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, before we find out, it\u2019s time for a quiz question about another famous food festival \u2013 Halloween."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s when people carve scary faces into pumpkins to frighten away evil spirits."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. Right. The tradition of carving pumpkins, or Jack o\u2019 Lanterns as they\u2019re called in the United States, started out as a Celtic festival in Ireland - but it was the Americans who started using pumpkins. So what vegetable did the Irish originally use to scare away ghosts? Was it: a) turnips? b) potatoes?,  or c) squash?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019ll say b) potatoes."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out the right answer later on. What\u2019s for sure is that cultures from around the world have been connecting food and magic for thousands of years, and over time it\u2019s created some strange beliefs."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s food historian Tasha Marks describing one unusual superstition to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Tasha Marks","text":"When you have superstitions and they sort of mix with science and health and medicine\u2026 and one of the examples of that would be something like garlic which\u2026 we all know garlic wards off vampires but it\u2019s also been thought to ward off the \u2018 evil eye\u2019 , and if you come across the term, the \u2018evil eye\u2019, it\u2019s a sort of blanket term that sort of applies to any bad luck."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Tasha says that garlic is believed to ward off vampires, meaning to repel or stop someone from harming you."},{"author":"Sam","text":"According to this superstition, garlic also keeps away the evil eye \u2013 bad luck or magical spells with the power to cause bad things to happen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Tasha describes the \u2018evil eye\u2019 as a blanket term for any bad luck. Just as a real blanket covers the different parts of your body, a blanket term is aphrase that\u2019s used to describe many examples of related things."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But food superstitions aren\u2019t only about bad luck - they also give our lives meaning."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Jonty Rajagopalan owns a tourist agency in Hyderabad, India, where she introduces visitors to some of the city\u2019s food traditions."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here she is talking with BBC World Service\u2019s, The Food Chain, about a tradition connected with the Hindu New Year. Can you spot the different tastes she mentions?"},{"author":"Jonty Rajagopalan","text":"Some of the traditions give you a little bit of a lesson , like every new year, and not 1st January, not the Gregorian calendar New Year, but the Hindu calendar New Year, we would always be given\u2026 it\u2019s a kind of a chutney which is made of all the five tastes:  so you have sour, you have sweet, you have something bitter in it and your mum would always give it to you saying that this is what the rest of the year is going to be \u2013 you\u2019ll have happiness, you\u2019ll have challenges, you\u2019ll have a little sadness, you\u2019ll have bitterness in your life, which I think is a very nice tradition \u2013 it prepares you for everything in life."},{"author":"Rob","text":"At Hindu New Year, mothers give their children a special chutney \u2013 a mixture of fruit, spices, sugar and vinegar. Did you spot the chutney\u2019s flavours, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"There was sour, sweet and bitter."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Mothers tell their children that the coming year, like the chutney, will have its own flavours, both good and bad."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s why Jonty says that traditions can teach (you) a lesson \u2013 they show you what you should or shouldn't do in the future, as a result of experience."},{"author":"Rob","text":"What a lovely way to end our look at food superstitions!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, maybe we should make chutney at Halloween, instead of carving pumpkins \u2013 or whatever vegetable the Irish originally used."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah, yes \u2013 in my quiz question I asked you what vegetable was originally used instead of pumpkins to scare away ghosts."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guessed it was b) potatoes."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer! In fact, turnips were originally used, so maybe Irish ghosts are smaller than American ones!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned about superstitions \u2013 old beliefs which are connected with magic."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Garlic is supposed to ward off, or keep away, dangers like the evil eye - bad luck or harmful magic."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The evil eye is an example of a blanket term \u2013 a phrase used to describe many examples of related things."},{"author":"Rob","text":"One Indian superstition involves chutney \u2013 a food mixing many flavours"},{"author":"Sam","text":"These traditions can teach you a lesson - show you how to act in the future based on your past experience."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right.
