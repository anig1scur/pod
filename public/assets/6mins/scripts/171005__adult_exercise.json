And welcome to 6 Minute English, where we vigorously discuss a new topic and six related items of vocabulary."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And hello, I\u2019m Rob. Today we\u2019re discussing vigorous exercise \u2013 and whether adults take enough of it! Vigorous means using a lot of energy to do something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So how many steps do you do in a day, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"How many steps? How should I know, Neil? \u2013 It would be pretty hard to count them all."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, come on! You can track steps on your phone! I do ten thousand a day \u2013 which is the magic number for keeping fit and healthy, apparently."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Not if you saunter, Neil, surely? Sauntering from the sofa to the fridge and back \u2013 Or from the house to the car."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well I never saunter, Rob. Saunter means to walk slowly. And you\u2019d have to make a lot of trips to the fridge to clock up ten thousand steps. To get some vigorous exercise, you need to get out and about \u2013 round the park at a brisk pace\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Brisk means quick and energetic \u2013 the opposite of sauntering. OK, well, perhaps you can you tell me, Neil, how many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? Is it\u2026 a) 4%, b) 14% or c) 40%?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m going to say\u2026 4% because ten minutes is such a short amount of time!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Indeed. Now, I\u2019ve got another question for you, Neil. Why is exercise so important? Because it sounds pretty boring \u2013 counting steps, going to the gym, running on a machine."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, when you exercise, you stimulate the body\u2019s natural repair system. Your body will actually stay younger if you exercise!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"That sounds good."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exercise also lowers your risk of developing illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hmm. I\u2019m getting a bit worried now, Neil. But I don\u2019t have enough time to do a thousand steps every day\u2026 I\u2019m far too busy!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Rob. Now might be a good time to listen to Julia Bradbury. She\u2019s a TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast who will explain how she builds walking into her busy life."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Julia Bradbury, TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast I will walk to meetings instead of catching a bus, or getting a taxi or a car \u2013 into meetings. And I will also, if I can\u2019t build that into my working day, if it\u2019s a day when I haven\u2019t got meetings and I\u2019m maybe at home with the kids, I will take the time \u2013 I will take my kids out with the buggy and I will definitely do 30-40 minutes at least everyday. Going to the park, going to the shops, picking up my things up en route, and really sort of building it into my life. Taking the stairs and not taking lifts, all of these kinds of little decisions can incrementally build up to create more walking time in your day."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So if you build something in to your day \u2013 or your life \u2013 you include it from the beginning."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And Julia Bradbury has built walking into her day. Even though she\u2019s very busy too, Rob! You should learn from her!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"So she walks instead of driving or taking the bus. And takes the stairs instead of the lift. I could do those things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You could indeed \u2013 before you know it, you\u2019d be doing ten thousand steps \u2013 because the amount of walking you do in a day builds incrementally."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Incrementally means gradually increasing in size. OK, well, before I think that over, perhaps I could tell you the answer to today\u2019s quiz question?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. You asked me: How many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? The options were: a) 4%, b) 14% or c) 40%?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And you said 4%. But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s actually 40%. And that\u2019s according to the Government body Public Health England here in the UK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, that\u2019s a lot more people than I expected. But it isn\u2019t that surprising \u2013 people in all age groups are leading more sedentary lifestyles these days. Our job is very sedentary \u2013 which means it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I might just run on the spot while we go over the new vocabulary we\u2019ve learned today!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good plan. First up we heard \u2018vigorous\u2019 \u2013 which means using a lot of energy to do something."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. \u201cI am running vigorously on the spot!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Great example! And good to see you taking some vigorous exercise! Number two \u2013 \u2018saunter\u2019 \u2013 means to walk slowly in a relaxed way. \u201cWhen I saw Rob, I sauntered over to say hello.\u201d"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hi Neil. Number three \u2013 \u2018brisk\u2019 means quick and energetic."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cIt\u2019s important to take some brisk exercise every day.\u201d"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes! And I\u2019m beginning to realise that might be true."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yep! I think you've done enough jogging for today, Rob. You\u2019ve probably done about a hundred steps."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Is that all? OK, number four \u2013 if you \u2018build something in to something\u2019 \u2013 you include it from the beginning."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u201cIt\u2019s important to build regular exercise into your daily routine.\u201d"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Very good advice. Number five is \u2018incrementally\u2019 which means gradually increasing in size."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Incremental is the adjective. \u201cThe company has been making incremental changes to its pay structure.\u201d"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Does that mean we\u2019re getting a pay rise?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I doubt it! And finally, number six \u2013 \u2018sedentary\u2019 means sitting a lot and not taking much exercise. For example, \u201cIt\u2019s bad for your health to lead such a sedentary lifestyle.\u201d"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Duly noted, Neil! Well, it\u2019s time to go now. But if today\u2019s show has inspired you to step out and take more exercise, please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye
