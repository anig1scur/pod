I'm Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I'm Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You look tired, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I didn\u2019t sleep well last night. I was tossing and turning all night, but I couldn\u2019t get to sleep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s a coincidence, as our topic today is insomnia - the condition some people suffer from when they find it difficult to get to sleep when they go to bed."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thankfully I don\u2019t really have insomnia, but every now and again, I find it difficult to get to sleep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, keep listening and we might have some advice to help with that, but first, a question: What is the record for the longest a human has gone without sleep? Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"All of those seem impossible! So I\u2019ve got to go with the shortest - about seven days."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if you can stay awake long enough, I\u2019ll let you know at the end of the programme. Dr Michael Grandner is an expert in all things to do with sleep. He was interviewed recently on the BBC radio programme Business Daily. He was asked what his best tip was to help you get to sleep if you are finding it difficult. What was his suggestion?"},{"author":"Dr Michael Grandner","text":"And it sounds counter-intuitive , but trust me I\u2019ve got decades of data behind this statement: If you cannot sleep, get out of bed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Rob, how does he suggest you help yourself to get to sleep?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well actually, he says that the best thing to do is to get out of bed!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That sounds exactly the opposite of what you should do, doesn\u2019t it?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, he does say that his advice is counter-intuitive , which means exactly that. That it is the opposite of what you might expect."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And he says that this advice is backed up by decades of research. A decade is a period of 10 years and when we say decades ,it\u2019s a general term for many years, at least 20. Let\u2019s hear that advice again from Dr Grandner."},{"author":"Dr Michael Grandner","text":"And it sounds counter-intuitive , but trust me I\u2019ve got decades of data behind this statement: If you cannot sleep, get out of bed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So why is getting out of bed good advice? Here\u2019s the explanation from Dr Grandner."},{"author":"Dr Michael Grandner","text":"When you\u2019re in bed and you\u2019re not asleep and you do that over, and over, and over again for extended periods of time, the ability of the bed to put you to sleep starts getting diluted . Not only that, it starts getting replaced by thinking, and tossing and turning , and worrying, and doing all these things. When you\u2019re not asleep, get out of bed. This is probably one of the most effective ways to prevent chronic insomnia . It\u2019s also one of the really effective ways to treat it. It won\u2019t work 100% of the time, but it will actually work more than most people think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We normally sleep in beds. Beds are designed to make it easy to sleep, but if we can\u2019t sleep, that makes the bed\u2019s impact weaker. As Dr Grandner says, 'it dilutes the power of the bed to help us sleep'."},{"author":"Rob","text":"When you dilute something, you make it weaker. For example, you can dilute the strength of a strong fruit juice by adding water to it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So if we stay in bed, tossing and turning , which is the expression we use to describe moving around in the bed trying to get to sleep, we begin to think of the bed as place where we don\u2019t sleep rather than as a place where we do sleep. So, get out of bed to break the connection."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This he says is a positive way to approach chronic insomnia . Chronic is an adjective that is used to describe conditions that are long-lasting. So we\u2019re not talking here about occasionally not being able to get to sleep, but a condition where it happens every night."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s hear Dr Grandner again."},{"author":"Dr Michael Grandner","text":"When you\u2019re in bed and you\u2019re not asleep and you do that over, and over, and over again for extended periods of time, the ability of the bed to put you to sleep starts getting diluted .

It won\u2019t work 100% of the time, but it will actually work more than most people think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Time to review today\u2019s vocabulary, but first, let\u2019s have the answer to the quiz question. What is the record for the longest a human has gone without sleep? Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I thought it must be about seven days."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not right. The answer, rather amazingly, is actually just over 11 days. Extra bonus points for anyone who knew that that was done in 1964 by someone called Randy Gardner."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s difficult to imagine even going a couple of days without sleep, but 11! I wonder how long he slept for after that!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"14 hours and 40 minutes."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You\u2019ve got all the answers, haven\u2019t you?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well when I can\u2019t sleep, I get up and read trivia! And now it\u2019s time for the vocabulary. Today our topic has been insomnia ."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This is the word for the condition of not being able to sleep. And something that people do when they are trying to sleep is toss and turn in bed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The opposite of what seems logical or obvious is counter-intuitive . It goes against what you might expect. So if you can\u2019t sleep, get out of bed."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Our next word is diluted . This is from the verb to dilute which means 'to make something less strong'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally there was the adjective chronic . This is an expression for a medical condition that is long-lasting. So someone who has chronic insomnia regularly has difficulty getting enough sleep. It\u2019s not just something that happens now and again."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, we hope that 6 Minute English isn\u2019t a cure for insomnia, but I do find listening to podcasts and spoken radio helps me get to sleep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, before we all drop off to sleep from the comforting tone of your voice, Rob, it\u2019s time for us to say goodbye.
