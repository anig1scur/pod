The idea is that the person playing detective discovers who the murderer is, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The last time I played Cluedo it was Professor Plum, in the library, with the dagger!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Cluedo is based on a very popular type of book \u2013 the murder mystery, sometimes called a whodunnit \u2013 a story about a murder which does reveal who the murderer is until the end."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The queen of murder mysteries is a British writer who was born in 1890.

Is it: a) Hetty Wainthropp? b) Jessica Fletcher? or, c) Miss Marple?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s a) Hetty Wainthropp."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil. I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"As mentioned, one of Agatha Christie\u2019s most famous books is \u2018Murder on the Orient Express\u2019. The story takes place on a train travelling from Istanbul in Turkey to Calais in northern France. Listen as writer and Agatha Christie superfan, Harriet Gilbert, summarises the story for BBC World Service programme, World Book Club."},{"author":"Harriet Gilbert","text":"Poirot is on the train, heading back home to England from Syria, when two unconnected events take place. In a snowstorm in Croatia, the train comes grinding to a halt and in one of the sleeping berths, a passenger is murdered. Since it\u2019s impossible for anyone to have reached the isolated snow-trapped train or to have escaped from it without leaving telltale footsteps in the snow, the killer can only be one of the dozen people sharing Poirot\u2019s coach. Yet as he starts to investigate it seems that each of them has an alibi for the time of the murder. Impossible? Well, Poirot\u2019s certainly perplexed \u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"During a snowstorm, the express train comes to a grinding halt \u2013 it slows down until it stops altogether. Then, someone is murdered!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"The murderer can\u2019t have escaped without leaving telltale footprints in the snow.

Poirot begins to investigate, but as he questions the train passengers one by one, it seems that everyone has an alibi - proof that they were somewhere else when a crime was committed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Naturally, this leaves the Belgian detective perplexed , or confused because something is difficult to understand or solve."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I won\u2019t spoil the story by telling you what happens next, Neil.
