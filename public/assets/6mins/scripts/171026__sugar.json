Welcome to 6 Minute English \u2013 we\u2019ve got a sweet topic today, and six tempting items of vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hello, I\u2019m Neil. And we\u2019re going to be talking about sugar \u2013 which many of us find tempting. But how much is too much, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I don\u2019t know, Neil, but hopefully we\u2019ll be finding that out. I must admit though \u2013 I have a sweet tooth \u2013 and that means I like sugary things!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Me too. But something I\u2019m always seeing in the news these days is that we\u2019re eating too much sugar. And one important factor is that sugars are sometimes hidden in processed foods."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Processed food is any food that has been changed in some way \u2013 by freezing it or putting it in tins \u2013 or by combining foods or adding chemicals. In fact, some of the sugars we eat are hidden in food that we think of as healthy. Such as yoghurts, low fat snacks, and fruit drinks."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you check the information on the back of food packets, Rob? \u2013 To see what\u2019s in them?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, I do. But it can be very confusing \u2013 there\u2019s so much information. And I\u2019m not always sure how much of a certain thing is bad."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that brings me onto today\u2019s quiz question. Can you tell me, if a food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it\u2026 a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019ll say low, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, we'll find out later. Some food products have colour coding on the packaging to help you understand the information, don\u2019t they? \u2013 red for high levels of sugar, salt or fat\u2013 orange for medium, and green for low."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That sounds helpful. Then you can see at a glance what\u2019s good or bad for you."},{"author":"Neil","text":"At a glance means with a quick look. OK, let\u2019s listen now to BBC reporter Rajeev Gupta interviewing a man in Chester, in the UK. He\u2019s asking him to guess how much sugar there is in a pot of fat-free yoghurt."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Rajeev Gupta, reporter interviewing a man in Chester Reporter: I've actually got a pot of yoghurt in front of me. This says 'fat-free' on it and it's been marketed as being quite healthy. If I was to say how much sugar is in here, what would you say as\u2026 say is the quantity of the tub? Interviewee: I\u2019d probably think maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls, you know, it\u2019s quite surprising how much is sugars in all these products, isn\u2019t there? Reporter: Well, there\u2019s about a third of this yoghurt pot is actually sugar. Interviewee: To be honest, that\u2019s quite amazing, that. I would never have thought a third of that would have been sugar just by looking at it. And it does say it\u2019s fat-free."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So the yoghurt is fat-free , which means it doesn\u2019t contain any fat. And the man guessed there might be two teaspoons of sugar in the yoghurt."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That\u2019s right. And if something is sugar-free then it doesn\u2019t contain any sugar. But in this case, a third of the yoghurt\u2019s content was sugar. That, to me, sounds like an awful lot \u2013 even for someone with a sweet tooth like me!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well, let\u2019s listen to Dr Gunter Kuhnle. He\u2019s a Nutritional Biochemist at Reading University."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Gunter Kuhnle, nutritional biochemist at Reading University, UK One problem we see \u2013 nutritionists \u2013 is sort of this focusing on any individual foods \u2013 at one time it was that fat has to be avoided at all costs, now it seems to go towards sugar and sugar is demonised and people link it to drugs and so on. I think this is the wrong way forward. Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet. It is important also to enjoy your food and not do this extreme focusing on one side or one aspect and individual nutrients."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So if you avoid something at all costs you do everything you can to avoid it. And demonise means to make someone or something seem very bad."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Kuhnle thinks that totally cutting out one type of food like this \u2013 whether it\u2019s fat or sugar \u2013 is wrong. He thinks we should eat a balanced diet \u2013 and enjoy our food."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That sounds very sensible. Now, how about telling us the answer to today\u2019s quiz question, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Thanks for reminding me, Rob. I asked: if food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it\u2026 a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle? You said low\u2026 and you were\u2026 right! Well done!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If foods contain more than 22.5% total sugars per 100g they are classified as high."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I guess that between 5 and 22.5% they are somewhere in the middle."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Correct! OK, shall we go over the words we heard today?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yep. First up \u2013 if you have a \u2018sweet tooth\u2019 it means you like sugary things. For example, \u2018My little nephew has a sweet tooth. He eats far too many biscuits and sweets.\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"His dentist won\u2019t be pleased! Number two \u2013 \u2018processed food\u2019 is any food that has been changed in some way \u2013 by freezing it or putting it in tins \u2013 or by combining foods or adding chemicals."},{"author":"Rob","text":"For example, \u2018The meat in sausages is highly processed.\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, I didn\u2019t know that. I\u2019m a big fan of sausages!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Number three \u2013 \u2018at a glance\u2019 \u2013 means with a quick look."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For example, 'I could tell at a glance that I wouldn\u2019t like the food at that restaurant.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"\u2018Fat-free\u2019 means without any fat in it. For example, \u2018I bought this yoghurt because it says fat-free on the label.\u2019"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Aha \u2013 but did you realise that a third of it was sugar! Moving on \u2013 If you avoid something\u2018at all costs\u2019 you do everything you can to avoid it. For example, \u2018I wanted to win the game at all costs.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I didn\u2019t know you were so competitive, Neil! And finally \u2013 \u2018demonise\u2019 \u2013 means to make someone or something seem very bad."},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u2018Politicians shouldn\u2019t demonise their opponents.\u2019"},{"author":"Rob","text":"They often do though, don\u2019t they?
