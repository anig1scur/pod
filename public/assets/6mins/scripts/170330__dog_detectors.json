We\u2019ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Everything ok, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I am so tired. One of my children is as sick as a dog . I didn\u2019t sleep all night long looking after them."},{"author":"Dan","text":"As sick as a dog is an expression meaning \u2018very ill\u2019. I\u2019m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s life in this old dog yet."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Good. It\u2019s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK\u2019s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Amazing. Any success?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Let me ask you in this week\u2019s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?  Is it"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m going to guess a) 50% Dan We\u2019ll find out later if you\u2019re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man\u2019s best friend? But I\u2019ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I\u2019ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated bio-sensor . You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been screened by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"So, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a bio-sensor , a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Neil Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to screen , or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, there\u2019s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they\u2019re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Nice. Any more? Maybe around the home?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning \u2018a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.\u2019"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yep. Ex-burglars have often said that they\u2019re a much bigger deterrent , or reason not to do something, than an alarm system."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh and there\u2019s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Exactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can\u2019t see them but a dog can still smell them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time biosensors then?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I don\u2019t know, but here\u2019s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies , so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully."},{"author":"Dan","text":"He mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies , or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let\u2019s hope so."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes I wouldn\u2019t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said 50%"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s a dog\u2019s life, Neil. I\u2019m sorry. The answer was c) 90%"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow! 90%! That\u2019s amazing."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Isn\u2019t it? Neil Shall we go through the vocabulary? Dan OK. The first expression we had was as sick as a dog . If you are as sick as a dog it means that you\u2019re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were as sick as a dog , Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was as sick as a dog . Next we had paws . Paws are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, dogs have paws . So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After paws , we had biosensor . A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic.  Then we had screen . If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport \u2013 where they would screen for explosives.  How else can it be used, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was deterrent . A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Good idea! Neil Finally, we heard orthodoxies . An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective is orthodox and we often hear its opposite word \u2013 unorthodox , meaning unusual. Do you do anything unorthodox , Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It\u2019s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I don\u2019t blame them! Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
