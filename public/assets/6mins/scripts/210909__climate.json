She went on to say this in her message to world leaders: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to act as if your house is on fire. Because it is.\u201d"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Her speech reflected the feelings of many young people around the world who think that not enough action is being taken on climate change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And they may be right, judging by the record-breaking temperatures that hit Canada and the north-west of the United States in July this year."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, Greta Thunberg\u2019s plea to \u2018act like your house is on fire\u2019 became a reality for residents of the small town of Lytton, Canada which burned to the ground in a shocking wildfire \u2013 a fire that is burning strongly and out of control."},{"author":"wake-up call","text":"So, was the Lytton wildfire yet another climate change  ? A wake-up call is the expression used to describe a shocking event that should make people realise that action is needed to change something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, maybe not, according to some climatologists who, worryingly, say that what happened in Lytton should not even have been possible. So in this programme we\u2019ll be asking if scientists have dangerously misunderstood the realities of climate change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first it\u2019s time for my quiz question and it\u2019s about that extreme weather in Canada. It broke records when the temperature in Lytton hit an all-time high on 1st July - but just how hot did it get? Was it: a) 39.6 degrees?, b) 49.6 degrees? or c) 59.6 degrees Celsius?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"All those temperature look really high, especially for snowy Canada. I\u2019ll say a) 39.6 degree C."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out the answer later on. Seeing your hometown burn to the ground is bad enough, but perhaps even worst was the fact that the wildfires were so unexpected."},{"author":"Sam","text":"According to weather pattern modelling done by a team of Oxford University researchers, such extreme heat was impossible - in theory, at least."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The research team was led by climatologist, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh.

Instead of being gradual the temperatures saw a jump , or a sudden increase, of five degrees. And it\u2019s this sudden jump that\u2019s got Professor Van Oldenborgh and his team worried."},{"author":"Neil","text":"By collecting data from all over the world climatologists try to predict changes in the pattern of global warming."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But, as Geert Jan van Oldenborgh told BBC World Service\u2019s, Science in Action, the heatwave in Lytton didn\u2019t fit these predictions at all:"},{"author":"Geert Jan van Oldenborgh","text":"Everything looked like a nice regular gradual trend like we were used to up to last year and then you suddenly break all your records by four or five degrees, I mean, this is something that\u2019s no supposed to happen and it has really shaken our confidence in how well we understand the effect of climate change on heatwaves."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Despite all his research, Professor Van Oldenborgh is still unable to explain such extreme and sudden changes in the climate \u2013 and this, he says, has shaken his confidence - made him doubt something that he was certain was true."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And it\u2019s this lack of understanding worrying researchers because, as the story of the town of Lytton shows, the effects of climate change may be even worse than expected."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Maybe it\u2019s time we all took notice of Greta Thunberg\u2019s wake-up call to take action on climate change."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Especially if even cold, northern countries like Canada, or Britain for that matter, can experience such extreme changes. Speaking of which, Neil, what was the answer to your quiz question?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, in my quiz question I asked you exactly how high the temperature reached in the Canadian town of Lytton. What did you say, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I thought it was a) 39.6 degrees Celsius. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, you were close but in fact it got even hotter, actually reaching 49.6 degrees Celsius \u2013 the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada by at least 5 degrees!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Phew! That\u2019s hot. Well, we\u2019d better recap the vocabulary from this programme because we might be hearing these words a lot more in the future!
