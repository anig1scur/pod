Question: what\u2019s a rat\u2019s favourite game?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I don\u2019t know, Sam, what is a rat\u2019s favourite game?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hide and squeak!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ha-ha-ha! Very funny!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re laughing because, as we\u2019ll be finding out in this programme, laughter is good for you! In fact, laughter is often called \u2018the best medicine\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And it seems that\u2019s really true, medically speaking. Laughing releases anti-stress endorphins into the body and there\u2019s evidence that people who laugh recover more quickly from illness, including Covid."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Laughing is an essential part of what makes us human. Babies cry straight from birth but the next sound they make, often as young as two or three months, is laughter."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And who can hear a baby laugh without laughing themselves? Laughter is catching."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But before we start tickling our funny bones, I have a quiz question for you, Neil, and it\u2019s no laughing matter. Laughter can be a serious business. In fact, there\u2019s a scientific field of study into laughter and its effects on the human body. But what is this study called? Is it: a) gigglology? b) gelotology? or c) guffology?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Did you make those words up, Sam? They sound a bit funny to me! I\u2019ll say the study of laughter is called b) gelotology."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, but you\u2019ll be laughing on the other side of your face if you\u2019re wrong! Anyway, we\u2019ll find out the correct answer later in the programme."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Someone who\u2019s an expert in the study of laughing \u2013 whatever it\u2019s called \u2013 is cognitive neuroscientist, Professor Sophie Scott. Here she explains to David Edmonds, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea, exactly how a laugh is produced."},{"author":"David Edmonds","text":"Laughing is a variation of breathing. Like breathing, it involves the rib cage ."},{"author":"Prof Sophie Scott","text":"When you laugh you get these very, very large, very fast contractions of the rib cage . And it\u2019s a very primitive way of making a sound, so you\u2019re really just squeezing air out in big bouts. Each of those individual squeezes gives you a \u2018ha!\u2019 sound."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The \u2018ha-ha\u2019 sound you make when you laugh comes from your rib cage - a structure made of bones, called ribs, inside your chest which protects the heart and lungs. The rib cage works like a drum to amplify a laugh."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s the reason why jokes are sometimes called \u2018rib-ticklers\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Professor Scott calls this a very primitive way of making sounds because it\u2019s simple, natural and essentially human."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The word primitive can be used to describe anything relating to the basic way humans lived in their early stages of development, before money, machines or writing were invented."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Primitive human noises, like crying and laughing, link to a universal human experience, and this can be seen in the large number of words we use to talk about them. In English, \u2018chuckle\u2019, \u2018giggle\u2019, \u2018chortle\u2019, \u2018cackle\u2019 and \u2018guffaw\u2019 all describe different types of laughter."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, so how would you describe a \u2018giggle\u2019, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019d say a giggle is laughing in a quiet but uncontrolled way, like a child who finds something very funny or feels embarrassed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unlike a guffaw which is when you blast out a very loud laugh, often at something stupid or rude someone has said."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But humans aren\u2019t the only animals to laugh. We belong to the same family as other primates like chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, all of whom laugh."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even rats tickle each other and make squeaky noises like laughter when they play. Here\u2019s Professor Scott again to take up the story for BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea."},{"author":"Prof Sophie Scott","text":"Play is a very important behaviour for mammals \u2013 all mammals play when they\u2019re juveniles and some mammals play their whole lives, and laughter is a sort of an invitation to play, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re playing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Professor Scott says that laughter is an important social tool for all mammals \u2013 animals, including humans, dogs and whales, which give birth to live young, rather than laying eggs, and who feed their young with milk."},{"author":"Neil","text":"By laughing, young mammals - sometimes called juveniles - signal that they want to play, and young rats who don\u2019t laugh back are more likely to get a bite than a giggle. And a rat bite is nothing to laugh about."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What a lot of facts we\u2019ve learned about laughter, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, we could almost be experts on laughter\u2026 \u2018Guffologists\u2019, isn\u2019t that what you called them, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, in my quiz question I asked you to name the scientific study of laughter and its effects on the body."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s not \u2018gigglology\u2019 or \u2018guffology\u2019!  So, the answer must be\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Gelotology! The correct answer! Well done, Neil, I knew you were good for a laugh!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from the programme before you think up any more terrible jokes! First, we had rib cage \u2013 the structure in your chest which is made of ribs, and produces the sound of a laugh."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The adjective primitive relates to the simple, natural way humans lived in their early stages of development."},{"author":"Neil","text":"There are different types of laughter, including giggles - childlike laughter in a quiet but uncontrolled way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And guffaw is when you laugh out loud, often at something someone has said."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Mammals are animals, including humans, which give birth to live young and feed them with milk."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, a young animal which is not fully grown can be called a juvenile."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, it\u2019s been a laugh a minute, Sam, but unfortunately our six minutes are up."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Join us again soon for more trending topics, useful vocabulary, and, who knows, maybe some terrible jokes, here at 6 Minute English.
