Or not\u2026?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oh, did I confuse you? My bad!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sam is speaking English, just a very modern type of English, for example saying \u2018my bad\u2019, instead of \u2018my fault\u2019 as a way of accepting that she\u2019s wrong."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Or adding \u2018not\u2019 at the end of a sentence to show I really mean the opposite of what I said. Both are examples of small changes in English which have happened naturally over the last decade or two."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Changes like these happen because, unlike say, Latin, which no-one speaks day-to-day, English is a living language \u2013 a language people speak and use in their ordinary lives."},{"author":"Sam","text":"New bits of English are invented as people use the language in new ways, but what happens when a language comes from an entirely different galaxy \u2013 somewhere like Qo\u2019noS, home planet of the Klingons?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, when sci-fi TV show, Star Trek, introduced alien characters called Klingons, the makers needed to invent a whole new language - Klingon."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Entirely made-up and unrelated to any human language, Klingon has developed a life of its own. Today you can even study it at university. So, Neil, my quiz question is this: in 2010, Klingon became the first invented language to do what? Is it:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, every language needs vocabulary, so I\u2019ll say a) Klingon was the first invented language to have its own dictionary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Klingon isn\u2019t the only made-up language invented for the movies. David Peterson is the creator of Dothraki, a language used in the fantasy TV show, Game of Thrones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"From his home in Los Angeles, David spoke to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth. They discussed Saint Hildegard who created the very first made-up language in the 12 th century:"},{"author":"David Peterson","text":"What she had was an entire list of nouns, a whole list of nouns \u2013 many of them godly, many of them not, and she would drop them into songs using Latin grammar and other Latin words, so it\u2019s not a language proper in the way that we understand it now, because really when we talk about a language it\u2019s not just the vocabulary, it\u2019s the grammar \u2013 nevertheless we still kind of look on her as the patron saint of modern conlanging."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Saint Hildegard invented new nouns but used Latin grammar, so David doesn\u2019t think her invention is a proper language. Nevertheless, Saint Hildegard is considered the patron saint of languages."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The patron saint of something refers to a Christian saint who is believed to give special help to a particular activity. Here, the activity is inventing a conlang , short for constructed language \u2013 artificially invented languages, like Klingon and Dothraki."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Another famous constructed language, Esperanto, was invented in 1887 by Polish doctor, Ludwik Zamenhof. He wanted to make it easier for people who spoke different languages to communicate with each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Listen as David Peterson speaks Esperanto with Michael Rosen and tests how much he understands for BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"},{"author":"David Peterson","text":"You are an English speaker from Western Europe, and in the 19 th Century \u2018universal\u2019 meant \u2018able to be understood by people from WesternEurope\u2019."},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"Yes, I might have got that one \u2013 the \u2018parle\u2019 bit from its Latin root , and \u2018me\u2019, obviously.

Er, no I got stuck on that one!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Like Spanish, Italian and other modern European languages, Esperanto is based on Latin. Michael guessed the meaning of the Esperanto word \u2018parolas\u2019 from its Latin root \u2013 the origin or source of a language."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the second sentence of Esperanto isn\u2019t so easy. Michael gets stuck on that one \u2013 he can\u2019t answer because it\u2019s too difficult."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think I\u2019d probably get stuck on that as well. But at least Esperanto was invented for humans, not alien creatures from outer space!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And speaking of creatures from outer space, did I get the right answer to your quiz question, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I asked Neil about an unusual first achieved by the made-up alien language, Klingon."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I guessed it was the first invented language to have its own dictionary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. Incredibly, the correct answer was c) - in 2010 a company of Dutch musicians and singers performed the first ever Klingon opera! The story must have been hard to follow but I\u2019m sure the singing was out of this world!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"MajQa! That\u2019s Klingon for \u2018great\u2019.
