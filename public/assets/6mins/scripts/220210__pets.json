This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil. Sam, do you remember an old children\u2019s television show called, \u2018Lassie\u2019?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, I grew up watching the adventures of schoolboy, Timmy, and his pet dog, a collie named Lassie. Whenever Timmy got lost or into trouble, Lassie sensed danger and came to the rescue."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you believe shows like \u2018Lassie\u2019, pets know when their human owners feel afraid or in danger. But in real life do animals know, or care, about human feelings?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Now, Neil, obviously we\u2019re not talking about wild animals, right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"We\u2019re talking about domesticated animals \u2013 types of animals which are under human control and have been living closely with people for centuries. They include pets, like cats and dogs, working animals and farm animals, like cows and sheep."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, what about dogs like our friend, Lassie? Do you think they can sense human feelings?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really going on behind a dog\u2019s big, brown eyes. Unlike humans, pets can\u2019t talk to say how they\u2019re feeling, and this makes it easy for us to misunderstand them. People often anthropomorphize their pets \u2013 treat them as if they were human by giving them human characteristics."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In cartoons, Micky Mouse can talk and Donald Duck dances and sings, but we know mice and ducks don\u2019t really do that in nature."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exactly. But recently, new research has suggested that sometimes pets do respond to their owner\u2019s feelings."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK. Well, before we find out more, I have a quiz question for you, Neil. \u2018Lassie\u2019 wasn\u2019t the only TV show to feature a boy and his pet companion. A similar show, Skippy, was set in Australia - but what type of animal was the star? Was Skippy: a) a rabbit? b) a frog? or c) a kangaroo?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if Skippy was Australian, I\u2019ll guess he\u2019s c) a kangaroo."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, Neil, earlier you mentioned that because animals can\u2019t speak, it\u2019s difficult to know their feelings about us."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Difficult, yes\u2026 but not impossible. Recently, anthrozoologist Dr Karen Hiestand, designed an experiment to test whether our pets really do care about us. She filmed pet owners pretending to be hurt and observed the reactions of their dogs and cats."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s Adrian Washbourne, producer for BBC World Service programme, Health Check, pretending to hurt his leg at home, where he lives with his two pets, a cat and a dog."},{"author":"Adrian Washbourne","text":"And now I\u2019m going to fake an injury, and we\u2019ll see how they respond. Ouch! Ow! Well, the tail wagging has got a bit more, there\u2019s a bit of a yawn. I don\u2019t think they were particularly sensitive or bothered that I was squealing around the floor in agony , holding my leg up in the air, trying to feign an injury. Meanwhile the cat, who\u2019s on the windowsill, is looking at me with wide eyes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Adrian didn\u2019t really hurt his leg \u2013 he feigned, or pretended, to be hurt. He pretended to be in agony \u2013 extreme physical pain, to see what his pets would do."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Adrian\u2019s dog wagged his tail and gave a yawn. The cat, meanwhile, just looked at him with wide eyes\u2026 Little evidence of pets showing care or concern there, you might think. But, according to Dr Hiestand, the animals\u2019 behaviour makes perfect sense when you remember where they came from. Dogs are descended from ancient breeds of wolves \u2013 very social animals who live together in packs, so it makes sense that a dog would sniff and come closer to investigate what was happening."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Cats, on the other hand, are solitary creatures, descended from wild cats who lived and hunted alone. Dr Hiestand thinks this explains the reaction of Adrian\u2019s cat, as she told BBC World Service programme, Health Check:"},{"author":"Dr Karen Hiestand","text":"What we\u2019re seeing typically is cats staying much more still\u2026 that they\u2019re looking and looking at their owner, so they\u2019re definitely paying their owner an awful lot of attention when they\u2019re displaying a negative distress emotion, comparing to during the control procedure where they\u2019re just doing cat things \u2013 walking around, grooming \u2026 that kind of thing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The experiment showed the different responses of cats and dogs to human distress \u2013 feelings of worry, sadness or pain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the experiment, dogs were visibly concerned, while cats simply paid more attention to what was going on. Some cats did nothing except carry on grooming \u2013 cleaning themselves using their tongue and paws."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The experiment confirms the idea we have of cats being cold and antisocial."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And of dogs being our best friend. But according to Dr Hiestand\u2019s findings, cats also feel human distress \u2013 they just show it in a different way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, if the experiment included Lassie, he\u2019d probably phone the emergency services, then make Adrian a cup of tea!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ha! And what about, Skippy?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, in my quiz question I asked Neil about the Australian TV star, Skippy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I guessed that he was c) a kangaroo."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Over two metres high and able to jump nine metres in a single hop, you\u2019d be in safe hands with Skippy the Kangaroo. Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with domesticated \u2013 a word to describe animals which are not wild and live under human control."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To anthropomorphize means to give animals human qualities and characteristics."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you feign illness, you pretend to be ill when you are not."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To be in agony means to be in extreme physical pain."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Someone who\u2019s in distress , feels worry, pain or sadness."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, grooming is how some animals clean themselves using their tongue and paws."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s all the time we have for this programme. Bye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Sam","Neil","Adrian Washbourne","Dr Karen
