This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In this programme we\u2019re going to be talking about the world of work."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, travelling to an office five days a week, sitting at a desk all day, and then going home."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Neil, it\u2019s not always like that. Office work doesn\u2019t have to be such a routine \u2013 the usual, fixed way of doing things \u2013 it is much more flexible these days."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s true. During the pandemic, we\u2019ve all had to have a more flexible approach to work."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, we have. And it has, perhaps, changed our attitude to working flexibly. But even before coronavirus, there was an opportunity to work flexibly, and we\u2019ll be discussing that soon."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But there\u2019s one thing that can\u2019t be changed and that\u2019s you setting a quiz question for me!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ah yes, I hadn\u2019t forgotten. So, Neil, I know you work very hard. But according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2013 the OECD \u2013 workers from which country work the longest hours? Is it\u2026 a) South Korea b) Germany, or c)  Mexico?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, as I\u2019m not on the list, let\u2019s go for c) Mexico."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, Neil, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. But let\u2019s talk more about flexible working now. Different countries have different laws about working flexibly \u2013 but here in the UK, for last 14 years, employees \u2013 workers \u2013 have had the right to request flexible working."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But what does it mean to work flexibly? Sarah Jackson is a workplace consultant and visiting professor at Cranfield University School of Management. She spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour programme about what it means exactly \u2026"},{"author":"Sarah Jackson, workplace consultant","text":"Because of the pandemic, now everybody thinks flexible working means working from home - it doesn't, it's about common sense , what does the job need in terms of when where, how long, and what do you need and what does your family need - and how do the two match ? So, flexibility really means having choice and control over when, where and how long you work, and agreeing that with your manager."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So, flexible working is not just working from home \u2013 something we\u2019ve got used to during the pandemic. It is about common sense \u2013 using our judgement to make sensible decisions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, requesting to work for two hours a day is not sensible \u2013 but being able to work from 12 until 8 instead of 9 to 5 might be. Of course, this depends on the needs of the business. And as Sarah said, you need to match your needs with that of the business. Match here means to work equally on both sides."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Getting the working conditions that suit you does require some negotiation with your manager. You need agreement from him or her \u2013 and that can be difficult if your manager is inflexible \u2013 not willing to change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But of course, in the UK at least, an employee has a right to request flexible working, and this must be considered by the employer. This law initially was just for parents with a child younger than 6 years old \u2013 or a disabled child less than 18."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But since 2014, everyone has the right to request flexible working. And that includes men."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is an important point, as Sarah Jackson explains. Fewer men seem to have their requests for flexible working accepted \u2013 let\u2019s find out why\u2026"},{"author":"Sarah Jackson, workplace consultant","text":"Men, when they do ask, are more likely to be turned down, so there's a real bias there in the system and the most important thing that needs to happen here, I think, is for employers to really actively say to their men, 'we know you want to be active fathers' - because there's a whole generation of young men who do want to be active fathers - 'please use the right to request flexible working, work flexibly if you can\u2019  because until men are enabled to be active fathers, we won't get equality at home and we certainly won't get equality in the workplace either."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, so men are more likely to have their request turned down \u2013 or rejected. And Sarah says there is a bias in the system \u2013 unfairness, treating one group of people more favourably than another."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And this is unfair because it can prevent some men being active fathers \u2013 actually being involved with childcare. But having more active fathers can lead to equality \u2013 or fairness \u2013 at home and in the workplace."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It sounds like something that needs to be looked at. But now, Neil, let\u2019s get the answer to my question: According to official data, in which country do workers work the longest hours?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said Mexico."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which is correct, well done! According to the OECD, the average Mexican spends 2,255 hours at work per year \u2013 the equivalent of around 43 hours per week. Germans, on the other hand, clock up the fewest hours."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, my working day is nearly over, so let\u2019s just recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed. Starting with routine \u2013 the usual, fixed way of doing things."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Common sense is our judgement to make sensible decisions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When you need something to match it has to work equally on both sides."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And when someone is inflexible , they are unwilling to change \u2013 sometimes we say they won\u2019t budge!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bias is unfairness, treating one group of people more favourably than another. And being active with something means being involved with it."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, there\u2019s no flexibility in our 6 minutes so we\u2019re out of time.
