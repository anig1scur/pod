We\u2019ll find out later if you were right. What\u2019s for sure is that Ignaz Semmelweiss was a hero to Val Curtis, a director at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Here she is talking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Science Stories :"},{"author":"Val Curtis, Director, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","text":"Semmelweiss is kind of my patron saint. Handwashing has been my life for the last thirty years working on trying to improve hygiene , mostly in developing countries and he was really the first to identify the importance of keeping hands clean in the prevention of the transmission of infection. And since the beginning of my career working in public health I\u2019ve been trying to understand how diseases get spread and what the best way of preventing it is, and handwashing jumped out as being the most important means of preventing infections, particularly in developing countries."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Val\u2019s work is all about improving hygiene - practices for maintaining health and preventing disease, especially through cleanliness."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And she was clearly influenced by the work of Dr Semmelweiss because she calls him her patron saint - a kind of guide and protector believed to give special help or inspiration."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But Dr Semmelweiss is also a good example of science communication. Getting the message out so people understand the importance of hygiene is difficult. And \u2018wash your hands\u2019 jumped out - or made a strong impact - as a simple message to communicate. Here\u2019s Val again:"},{"author":"Val Curtis, Director, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","text":"It wasn\u2019t until we wrote a paper in 2003 that showed the evidence that handwashing could save a million lives that actually people started to take it seriously and handwashing became a big important issue internationally.
