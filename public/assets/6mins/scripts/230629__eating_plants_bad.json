This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many people these days choose not to eat meat, and for vegetarians, eating animals is wrong. But what about digging up a carrot, or picking apples from a tree? Is that wrong too?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I don\u2019t think so, Neil. Plants aren\u2019t alive in the same way as animals, are they? They can\u2019t think or feel pain. And even vegetarians need to eat something . Fruit, vegetables, rice, beans \u2013 they all come from plants."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s true that plants don\u2019t have brains or nerves, but according to some scientists, they\u2019re much more than passive things rooted in the ground. Plants can learn and remember, they solve problems, and can even recognise other plants in their \u2018family\u2019. So, given the amazing things plants do, is it right to eat them? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be discussing in this programme, and as usual we'll be learning some new useful vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But first I have a question for you, Neil. Anyone who's seen cows grazing knows it\u2019s usually animals that eat plants, but some plants have turned the evolutionary tables to eat animals instead. So, which tropical plant is famous for trapping insects to eat? Is it: a)    the corpse flower? b)    the American skunk cabbage? or c)    the Venus fly trap?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think it\u2019s c) the Venus fly trap."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Neil. We\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the right answer later in the programme. Plants have been on the planet for hundreds of millions of years longer than humans, and have used that time to evolve special skills. Here\u2019s Professor Rick Karban, a biologist at the University of California, explaining more to James Wong, botanist and presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Is Eating Plants Wrong?"},{"author":"Prof. Richard Karban","text":"Without eyes plants can perceive a lot of information about light, without noses plants can perceive chemical information, without ears plants can perceive sounds, and so we've come to realise that plants are very perceptive about what's going on in their environments."},{"author":"James Wong","text":"You could argue for example that plants can perceive most of the senses that humans can."},{"author":"Prof. Richard Karban","text":"I would agree with that and then some \u2026"},{"author":"James Wong","text":"What d\u2019you mean, \u2018 and then some\u2019 ?"},{"author":"Richard Karban","text":"Anyone who's had a dog knows that dogs have a much keener sense of smell than humans do, and we're now learning that plants are very responsive to chemicals in their environment."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Even without ears, eyes, or a nose, plants are very perceptive \u2013 they notice things around them. In fact, Professor Karban says that plants perceive as much as humans and then some - an idiom meaning \u2018and even more\u2019 which is used to emphasise that what you mentioned before was an understatement. For example: Bill Gates is rich and then some!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Like dogs, plants have a keen sense of smell, which they used to detect chemicals in the air. Here, keen means powerful and intense."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, so plants can \u2018see\u2019 light and \u2018smell\u2019 the air, but does that mean they\u2019re intelligent?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Maybe so. Studies modelled on the famous Pavlov\u2019s dog experiment, have trained pea seedlings to find the quickest route to light through a maze, and remember it \u2013 evidence of memory. In another experiment, potted plants were lined up with roots joining them like a chain of people holding hands. The plants talked to each other, passing along information about water and air temperature through their roots, like children playing a game where a message is passed on, in a whisper, through a chain of people, becoming distorted in the process. Distorted means changed from its original form."},{"author":"Neil","text":"All this takes brain power, and there\u2019s clearly evidence that plants might have some kind of intelligence. So, given all of this, is it wrong to eat them? That\u2019s what James Wong asked, Michael Marder, professor of philosophy at the University of the Basque Country for his BBC Radio 4 programme, Is Eating Plants Wrong?"},{"author":"James Wong","text":"Is it wrong to eat plants?"},{"author":"Prof Michael Marder","text":"It is not in and of itself wrong to eat plants, but we have to do so while keeping in mind the context in which we're doing this. We have to first of all think about what kinds of plants we are eating, what are the parts of those plants? Are we in fact destroying the entire living being, or just taking certain of its parts such as fruits and leaves that are not essential to it that can actually fall off without doing harm to the whole organism?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Professor Marder says that eating plants is not wrong in and of itself \u2013 when considered alone, without taking anything else into account. But he thinks it\u2019s important to remember the context \u2013 the situation or circumstances in which something happens. Picking an apple, for example, is okay because it doesn\u2019t kill the tree itself which can go on to produce more fruit."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It seems plants really are clever \u2013 but do they know the answer to your question, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah yes, I asked you to name the famous insect-eating topical plant."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said it was the Venus fly trap."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which was the correct answer. Well done, Neil. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with the adjective perceptive \u2013 quick to notice and understand things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The idiom, and then some means \u2018and even more\u2019 and is used to show that something has been understated."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A keen sense of smell, sight or hearing , is powerful and intense."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Distorted means changed from its original form."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The phrase in and of itself means when considered alone, without taking anything else into account."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, the context is the general situation in which something happens. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Goodbye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Rob","Prof. Richard Karban","James Wong","Richard Karban","Prof Michael
