This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re talking about money \u2013 and Beth, as the old saying goes, money makes the world go round!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"You mean it\u2019s very important and lots of things couldn\u2019t happen without it. Well, we all need money \u2013 but have you noticed how our money doesn\u2019t seem to buy so much these days?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, I have Beth. It seems like consumers like us are being hit in the pocket at the moment \u2013 and by that, I mean we have less money to spend."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Now, I\u2019m no economist, but I know this has a lot to do with inflation - the increase in prices of things over time."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s a big problem globally, and Beth my question for you is about inflation. According to one report, what was the annual inflation rate in Venezuela between November 2017 and 2018? Was it: a)    130% b)    1,300% or c)    1,300,000%?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"I\u2019ll say b) 1,300%"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. We\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right later on. But let\u2019s talk more about money and inflation now. Around the world, prices of things are rising more than normal, and more worrying is that prices keep going up."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Two things in particular are increasing in price \u2013 energy, like gas and electricity, and food. These are things we need and depend on. So, what\u2019s causing the rises?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"There seem to be two main reasons \u2013 the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which has reduced the supply in things we need. And when things are in short supply \u2013 available in limited quantities - prices go up."},{"author":"Beth","text":"The BBC World Service programme The Real Story discussed this in much more detail. One expert, economist, writer and broadcaster, Linda Yueh, explained how price rises could be around for a while\u2026"},{"author":"Linda Yueh, economist, writer and broadcaster","text":"Even if you take out some of these volatile items like food and energy, the sustained price increases we've had, it is actually getting passed through into how companies price their goods and services. and that's where it gets extremely worrying because that suggests that even if energy prices, food prices, come down, we could have inflation now in the system and I think that for advanced economies is worrying, for developing countries, that's hugely worrying."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Linda Yueh used some interesting language there. She talked about food and energy being volatile items \u2013 something that is volatile is unpredictable and can change suddenly. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced with food and energy prices."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Yes, and she said these price increases have been sustained \u2013 so, continuing at the same level for a long period of time. But Linda Yueh says that even if energy and food prices eventually come down, companies will pass on the extra costs they have already faced by charging more for their goods and services."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And this could cause inflation \u2013 there\u2019s that word again. Continuing price rises aren\u2019t good for anyone but especially for people in developing economies \u2013 countries which have industry that\u2019s less developed and have lower living standards."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Another possible consequence of inflation is recession \u2013 this economic term describes a situation where a country\u2019s production starts going down, people\u2019s incomes go down and unemployment goes up. This all sounds like a very bleak economic outlook. So, what can be done?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, that\u2019s the million-dollar question, and economists are trying to work it out. Speaking on The Real Story programme, economist Vicky Pryce gave an overview of how to control inflation."},{"author":"Vicky Pryce, economist","text":"One of them, something that is actually most effective , is by slowing down demand. And if you increase interest rates , what you do is you discourage people from borrowing, whether they are individuals or whether they are businesses - and of course the economy starts slowing down."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, she says what is most effective \u2013 meaning what works well and gets the best results \u2013 is slowing down demand. Increasing interest rates can do this because people will borrow less money. Interest rates are fees banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And if we borrow less money, we buy fewer things, which can reduce inflation. I think it makes sense now! And if you were in Venezuela in 2018, you would really want inflation to go down, wouldn\u2019t you?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes. Now, earlier I asked you what one report said the inflation rate was there between November 2017 and 2018."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I said a very high 1,300%."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it was even higher, Beth. According to a study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018. This extreme financial situation was known as hyperinflation ."},{"author":"Beth","text":"That\u2019s not good at all. In this programme, we have been talking about inflation \u2013 that\u2019s the increase in prices over time."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Other vocabulary we used included the expression hit in the pocket \u2013 which means you have less money to spend."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Volatile describes something that is unpredictable and can change suddenly."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Something that is sustained continues at the same level for a long period of time. And something that is effective works well and gets the best results."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And interest rates are fees banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, we hope you\u2019ve found our brief lesson about the economy useful. Thanks for listening. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Bye bye!"}],"authors":["Rob","Beth","Linda Yueh, economist, writer and broadcaster","Vicky Pryce,
