It makes my flesh creep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh dear, if something makes your flesh creep it means you feel frightened or disgusted by something. I don\u2019t know why I do it. It just feels nice."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But you\u2019ll end up with arthritis when you\u2019re older, you know. Arthritis is a disease that causes pain and swelling in joints of the body."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s an old wives\u2019 tale, Rob! And that means an old idea or belief that has no scientific support."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, if you say so, Professor. And since you\u2019re in a scientific mood, how about answering today\u2019s quiz question. Which type of joint can you crack? Is it \u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, this professor isn\u2019t feeling too clever today. I\u2019m going to have to take a guess and say, c) synovial."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. Well, we\u2019ll find out how smart you really are later on in the programme. Now let\u2019s listen to Greg Kawchuk, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta. Rehabilitation means the process of helping somebody get better from an illness or injury."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Greg Kawchuk, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta We\u2019ve recently been able to use some new technology through MRI imaging to see for the first time what is actually happening inside the joint when someone pops or cracks their knuckles. And because of that we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to start to ask questions about why is it that some people can do this and other people can\u2019t."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What does MRI stand for?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"It means Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Hospitals use this technology to produce an image of the inside of a person\u2019s body."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So some people can\u2019t crack their knuckles. Can you, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m not about to try. But it isn\u2019t just finger knuckles that crack \u2013 you can do it with your neck, back, knees, ankles and toes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Greg Kawchuk says that comparing people who crack their knuckles and people who don\u2019t might provide some insight \u2013 or understanding \u2013 into whose joints are healthier."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Sounds interesting. But what actually happens when you crack your knuckles, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, when you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're making the bones of the joint pull apart\u2026 like this\u2026(cracking knuckles)"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Please don\u2019t do it again!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, it stretches the space around the joint and surrounding fluid and causes a decrease in pressure. As a result, gas dissolved in the fluid becomes less soluble \u2013 or less able to be dissolved \u2013 leading to the formation of bubbles. Now when you stretch the joint far enough, these bubbles burst, producing the \u2018pop\u2019 sound."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ouch! Excellent \u2013 well, thanks for the biology demonstration there, Neil \u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Any time! Any time, Rob! Now let\u2019s hear from the professor again about the medical value of research into knuckle cracking."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Greg Kawchuk, Professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Alberta When our engineering colleagues do this between two flat surfaces say of ceramic or porcelain\u2026 When they do this and they pull them apart quickly and there\u2019s a little bit of fluid in between \u2013 they can use electron microscopy to see there\u2019s been tremendous damage to the surfaces of the joints. But for some reason we don\u2019t see that in the human joint. There\u2019s something that makes it very resilient."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Interesting stuff! So scientists have performed experiments to imitate what happens in a human joint when you crack your knuckles. And when you quickly pull apart a pair of ceramic \u2013 or clay \u2013 tiles with fluid between them, it causes a lot of damage to the surface of the tiles."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So why don\u2019t human joints get damaged as well?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, the scientists don\u2019t actually know. They can see the damage to the tiles using electron microscopy \u2013 that\u2019s a very powerful microscope. But it\u2019s not clear what makes the human joint so resilient to damage \u2013 and resilient in this context means returning to its original shape after being stretched or bent."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. But with further research scientists may be able to find out \u2013 and then use this information to help people with joint problems."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Or they could create synthetic \u2013 or man-made \u2013 materials which can withstand wear and tear better than current ones. Withstand means not be damaged by something and wear and tear means damage as a result of ordinary use."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Can we have the answer to today\u2019s quiz question now, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, of course. So which type of joint can you crack? Is it \u2026 a) fibrous? b) cartilaginous? Or c) synovial?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said: c) synovial."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You are quite clever actually because you are right, or was it a good guess?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It was a good guess."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well done! And synovial is the name for the fluid that surrounds this type of joint."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. So can we hear the words we learned today again?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Of course. We heard:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s the end of today's 6 Minute English. We thought it was a cracking show!
