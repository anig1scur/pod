Just now we were talking about London but sporting projects like the Ebony Club are happening all over the world."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In Cape Town, South Africa, British surfer Tim Conibear noticed how kids from poor townships hardly ever went to the beach. So he started giving them free surfing lessons."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tim founded the \u2018Waves for Changes\u2019 project and now hundreds of kids go along each week to get \u201csurfing therapy\u201d. Not only is surfing giving them a buzz, it's helping to improve their life chances."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here he is talking to the BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World :"},{"author":"Tim Conibear","text":"Surfing also is quite difficult so you\u2019re learning a very challenging skill that takes a lot of confidence. Very small successes which children have when they go into the water elicit a really big emotional response. If you come from a background of trauma quite often you\u2019ll have a negative self-image and being able to try something new, achieve something new, be recognised by a coach or a mentor is very very good for your confidence as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Most of the surfers have experienced trauma \u2013 emotional pain and shock caused by very distressing experiences."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This has given them a negative self-image \u2013 the way a person feels about themselves, their ability, personality and value."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Surfing helps kids improve their self-image because it\u2019s challenging - difficult in a way that tests your ability and determination."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So challenging, in fact, that the children have a mentor \u2013 a trusted advisor who gives help and support to a younger or less experienced person."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Tim believes that the concentration needed to surf makes the children\u2019s other problems disappear - at least for a short time."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the results so far have been optimistic, with a significant reduction in violent behaviour reported among Cape Town\u2019s young surfers."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Surfing is quite well-known in South Africa. But what happens when you take a completely unknown sport into one of the least developed countries on earth?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"In 2007, Australian Oliver Percovich was travelling in Afghanistan with his skateboard. The children there were fascinated so he started showing them how to skate."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The idea grew and a few years later he founded the organisation \u2018Skateistan\u2019 giving free skateboard lessons to children aged five to seventeen, with a focus on those with disabilities, from low-income backgrounds and especially, girls."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Here\u2019s \u2018Skateistan\u2019 volunteer, Jessica Faulkner, explaining how skateboarding reinforces positive educational messages which Afghan kids don\u2019t always get at home."},{"author":"Jessica Faulkner","text":"There\u2019s a few things that skateboarding does as a kind of function. It is really quite challenging \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy sport for anyone whether you\u2019re young or old. And that means that it also teaches quite a lot of life skills. You have to fall off a skateboard quite a lot of times before you get better and it really helps children with things like goal setting and resilience and determination. Also, and really importantly, we do believe that children should have fun."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like surfing, skateboarding is challenging and difficult. It requires effort and Jessica believes this teaches children important life skills \u2013 the basic skills needed to solve problems commonly encountered in everyday life."},{"author":"Sam","text":"One important life skill is goal setting \u2013 deciding what things you want to achieve and how you plan to achieve them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Along with other skills like determination and resilience, this helps kids improve their outlook on life."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And to experience one of the most important things \u2013 having fun!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which reminds me about the kids at the Ebony Club and my quiz question. Remember that I asked you which sport the club uses to support disadvantaged children in London."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, and I said, b) tennis."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But in fact, it\u2019s c) horse riding - a sport normally associated with the elite."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In this episode we\u2019ve been discussing how sport can help improve the life chances of young people from tough backgrounds, many of whom have suffered trauma \u2013 severe emotional pain and distress."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Such pain damages a child\u2019s self-image \u2013 how they see and value themselves in the world."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This can be improved by taking part in sports, like surfing, skating and horse riding, which are challenging \u2013 demanding and testing of your abilities."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Often kids are supported by a mentor \u2013 a trusted, more experienced friend who can offer help and advice."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And with this support they learn life skills \u2013 basic skills everyone needs to cope with everyday problems."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One important skill is goal setting \u2013 deciding what you want to accomplish and planning how to do it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And of course, sometimes the most important goal is just to have fun!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all we have time for today.
