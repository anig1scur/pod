Did you know that one of the producers, here, has an allergy to peanuts?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, I didn't \u2013 but they're not in the studio with us, so it doesn't matter, does it?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"It only takes a tiny piece of peanut to cause a big allergic reaction in some people. An allergy by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating, touching or breathing in a particular substance."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And food allergies are the subject of today's show."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Alright, put your peanuts down, Neil and answer today's quiz question. What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it\u2026 a) penicillin? b) adrenalin? Or c) aspirin?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well, I'm going to go for a) penicillin."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on. Now let's listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing. She is a dietician here in the UK."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Dr Marianne Williams, gastroenterology dietician, UK For roughly the first month of life the immune system is switched off in essence and everything they [babies] get exposed to in that first month in life \u2013 dogs, cats, aunts, uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt \u2013 everything \u2013 that is where they build up all the bacteria that are then going to colonise their gut in the future. Now, if you're born into a very sterile environment, as is increasingly the case in the western world, everything's kept terribly clean, and one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria at that very very early stage in that first month of life."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Dr Marianne Williams. The immune system is our body's defence against infection. And it's switched off \u2013 or not working \u2013 for the first month of a baby's life."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And through exposure to lots of things in our environment \u2013 that's family, pets, dirt and so on \u2013 young babies meet different bacteria for the first time which colonise \u2013 or live and grow in \u2013 their guts."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Yes, but in a sterile environment babies don't get exposed to \u2013 or don't meet \u2013 a wide enough variety of bacteria. Sterile means completely clean and free of bacteria. And there's a theory that being too clean and bacteria-free \u2013 now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation \u2013 has lead to an increase in allergies."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So dirty play for babies is good \u2013 mud, pets, picking stuff up off the floor and eating it."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Used to? I still do. I enjoy food from the floor!"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well, Neil, what can I say? We're both lucky to be allergy-free. I have a friend who has an allergy to gluten \u2013 a protein found in wheat and some other grains \u2013 and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn't get ill."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The supermarkets are quite helpful, though, aren't they, with products 'free from this' and 'free from that'?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"This is helpful, yes. But the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers who don't have a proven \u2013 or tested \u2013 allergy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Why would you buy free-from foods if you don't have a food allergy?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Well, people have started to believe that certain foods \u2013 like gluten or dairy \u2013 are bad for us, though there isn't any medical evidence to support this. Let's hear about how rickets \u2013 a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the diet \u2013 is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Mike Williams, BBC reporter R ickets is common in the developing world but this is London in the 21st century. These children aren't malnourished because they're too poor to eat well \u2013 it's the opposite. Their often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with ingredients taken out. It's as if some of us have become unnecessarily frightened of our food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Rickets usually affects malnourished childrenfrom poor countries\u2013 children who don't have enough to eat \u2013 and it makes their bones weak. But here in London some parents are buying their children expensive free-from foods \u2013 for example to avoid dairy \u2013 and are sometimes making them very ill."},{"author":"Alice","text":"It sounds crazy, doesn't it?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yeah\u2026 it's nuts ! Get it? Nuts."},{"author":"Alice","text":"Very good."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes. Nuts - that means crazy. Now I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question."},{"author":"Alice","text":"OK, then. So earlier in the show I asked: What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it\u2026 a) penicillin?  b) adrenalin?  Or c) aspirin?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said a) penicillin."},{"author":"Alice","text":"And you were wrong, Neil! The correct answer is b) adrenalin. An injection of adrenalin can be used to treat anaphylaxis \u2013 or severe allergic reactions \u2013 to insect stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens. Antibiotics such as penicillin treat bacterial infections and aspirin is a painkiller you might take for a headache."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, can you tell us the words we heard today again please, Alice?"},{"author":"Alice","text":"Sure. They are: allergy immune system switched off colonise get exposed to sterile gluten proven rickets malnourished nuts anaphylaxis"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
