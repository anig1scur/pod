    "We know that protein is important for our health. It plays a crucial role in many of the body's functions, including growth, repair, the immune system and, of course, building muscles! But has our love for protein come at the expense of other important food groups, like fibre? Neil and Georgie discuss this and teach you some new vocabulary."

In shops and on social media, you'll find all kinds of high-protein foods being advertised, from shakes and yoghurts to chocolate. Here's Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service programme The Food Chain:"

Products which already contain protein, like yoghurt, are re-packaged as 'high-protein', while other items have extra protein added, often in the form of beans and pulses. Protein is big business!"

Irishman Patrick Callahan is a big name in the protein-muscle world, but do you know who he is? Is he: a)    the owner of a company which makes protein shakes, b)    the winner of the 2024 Mister Universe bodybuilding contest, or c)    the scientist who discovered a new protein in outer space?"

Sales of protein products make around \u00a37 billion globally. Here's Scott Dicker from SPINS, a market research company in Chicago, talking with BBC programme The Food Chain:"

      "text": "Unlike carbs \u2013 that's carbohydrates \u2013 and fat, consumers don't see any downside to eating protein. Scott says protein has a health halo , a marketing term which describes perceiving a food to be healthy based on a single feature, such as being 'organic', 'gluten-free' or in this case 'high-protein', even if its overall nutritional value is poor."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
