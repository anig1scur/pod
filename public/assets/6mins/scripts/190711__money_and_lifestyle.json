I'm Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I'm Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme we're talking about finance and in particular planning for our future lifestyles."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I can barely afford my current lifestyle!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Same here, but perhaps we\u2019ll pick up some good tips today. Before that though, a question. Being a millionaire may be an impossible dream for most of us, but when was the word first used in English? Was it: a) 1600s b) 1700s, or c) 1800s What do you think, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019m going to guess that it\u2019s the 1600s as there have always been very wealthy people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later. Now, the BBC Money Box programme covers all sorts of financial features. Recently they were talking about lifestyle financial planning, which is planning your finances to meet the kind of lifestyle you want to have. Julie Lord leads a financial planning organisation and she talked about the process of lifestyle financial planning. How many numbers does she say you need to start with?"},{"author":"Julie Lord","text":"Well, we would start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cashflow forecast or a model. You just need four numbers: your income , your expenditure , assets , liabilities and then we project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have if you do nothing at all and if indeed you do some of the things that - perhaps an ISA or a pension or any other kind of financial product - might help you with."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So how many numbers do you need?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"She says that you start with just four numbers."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right. The first of these numbers is your income , this is the money that you have coming in, your salary, for example."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Then there is the number for your expenditure . This is the money you have going out for rent, food, entertainment, transport and so on."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The next number was for assets . This is the cash value of things that you own. For example property, cars, jewellery as well as savings and investments, that kind of thing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally there is liabilities . This is the money that you owe, for example on credit cards or loans."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So if you know these details, she says they can come up with a lifetime cashflow forecast , which is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have in the future and if that is enough to meet your expectations. Do you have those details? Do you know your numbers, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I have a very detailed spreadsheet where I do list my income and expenditure . So I do know from month to month how much money I need and how much I can spend."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That sounds very organised! What does it tell you about your future?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it just reminds me of exactly how much money I don\u2019t have. It\u2019s quite depressing! How about you, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh, I live in blissful ignorance. I have no idea how big my debts are. I try not to worry about it. I kind of think I\u2019m much too young to worry about it now and that as if by magic it will all work out in the end. So it would be difficult for me to come up those four numbers. Anyway, let\u2019s listen to Julie Lord again describing the lifestyle financial planning process."},{"author":"Julie Lord","text":"Well, we would start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cashflow forecast or a model. You just need four numbers: your income , your expenditure , assets , liabilities and then we project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have if you do nothing at all and if indeed you do some of the things that - perhaps an ISA or a pension or any other kind of financial product - might help you with."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Is lifestyle financial planning only for older people with a good pension? Not according to Julie Lord."},{"author":"Julie Lord","text":"Well, it\u2019s not all about old age, is it? I mean there are people\u2026 we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us and say 'we just want to get financially organised, we've heard about all this stuff, these financial products, no idea really what they are or, more importantly, what they\u2019re going to do for us, so can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So she also has younger clients who ask for her company\u2019s help."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, she uses the phrase, give us a hand , which means to help someone. If you give someone a hand, you help them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Exactly, in the way that I give you a hand with 6 Minute English."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I think I give you a hand rather than the other way around, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Really, well let\u2019s not fall out about it. Let\u2019s listen to Julie Lord again."},{"author":"Julie Lord","text":"Well, it\u2019s not all about old age, is it? I mean, there are people\u2026 we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us and say 'we just want to get financially organised, we've heard about all this stuff, these financial products, no idea really what they are or, more importantly, what they\u2019re going to do for us, so can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s nearly time now to review our vocabulary, but first, let\u2019s have the answer to our quiz question. When was the word millionaire first used in English? Was it: a) 1600s b) 1700s, or c) 1800s What did you think, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I guessed and said it was the 1600s."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, not a good guess this time, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s actually a lot later. It was the 1800s when it was first used in English, though it had appeared in French in the 1700s. Now on with the vocabulary."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, we had a lot of financial terms in this programme. We had cashflow forecast . This is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have at a particular time in the future."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the cashflow forecast is based on knowing your income , which is the money you have coming in and your expenditure , the money you have going out."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You also need to know your assets , which is the value of things you own as well as savings and investments. This is balanced against your liabilities , which is the term for the money that you owe, for example on credit cards."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally we had the expression to give someone a hand meaning to help someone. Well, that\u2019s all from us in this programme. We look forward to your company next time. Until then, you can find us in all the usual places on social media, online and on our app. Just search for bbclearninglish. Bye, and thanks Rob for giving me a hand."},{"author":"Rob","text":"No, thank you for giving me a hand. Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Rob","Julie
