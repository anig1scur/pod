This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam.  Can you wait a second, Rob? I have to spend a penny."},{"author":"Rob","text":"What! You\u2019re going shopping now, are you? We\u2019re just about to start the programme!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"No, no, I have to\u2026 you know, \u2018 spend a penny\u2019. Haven\u2019t you heard that expression before? Spend a penny means \u2018go to the toilet\u2019. It\u2019s an old idiom from the days when it cost a penny to unlock the door of a public toilet."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, I see. Well, you\u2019re showing your age there, Sam \u2013 most young people today wouldn\u2019t know what that phrase meant, and there aren\u2019t many public toilets left nowadays anyway."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Language changes fast, and new words and phrases are being created all the time. In this programme, we\u2019ll be learning some modern idioms \u2013 new expressions that have been introduced to English through the internet, TV and social media. And of course, we\u2019ll be learning their meanings a well."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Great, I\u2019m \u2018raring to go\u2019 \u2013 another idiom there. But first, as usual, I have a question for you, Sam. Many well-known idioms come from the world of sport, for example \u2018throw in the towel\u2019 which means \u2018give up\u2019, or \u2018surrender\u2019. But which sport does the idiom \u2018throw in the towel\u2019 come from? Is it: a)    football? b)    tennis?  or c)    boxing?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I think I know this one. It\u2019s c) boxing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme, so just hold your horses for now!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah, another idiom there, Rob - hold your horses meaning \u2018stop and think for a moment\u2019. That\u2019s an idiom that Gareth Carrol might teach his university students. Dr Carrol is the author of a new book, \u2018 Dropping the Mic and Jumping the Shark: Where Do Modern Idioms Come From?\u2019 He became interested in idioms when he realised that he didn\u2019t know many of the expressions his students used in their everyday speech, modern idioms like \u2018jump the shark\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Here is Gareth Carrol telling BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth, about one source of many modern idioms \u2013 the movies."},{"author":"Dr Gareth Carrol","text":"So, Groundhog Day I think more or less has the meaning of \u2018d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2019 now, and it\u2019s completely embedded in the language\u2026 actually, that\u2019s probably one of the first phrases that got me thinking about these modern idioms in the first place because it is so ubiquitous , it\u2019s used in a huge range of contexts, and one of the things that made me sit up and take notice is, I had a number of students who know the phrase, Groundhog Day , but had no idea it was a film."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In the film, Groundhog Day, the main character wakes up to live the same day over and over again. Gradually, the movie title itself became an idiom, Groundhog Day, meaning a situation in which events that have happened before, happen again in exactly the same way. It\u2019s similar in meaning to another expression \u2013 d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu."},{"author":"Rob","text":"When phrases the movies develop into idioms it\u2019s often because they are ubiquitous \u2013 they seem to appear everywhere."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And one of the ways they appear everywhere is, of course, the internet. Here\u2019s Gareth Carrol again, telling more to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"},{"author":"Dr Gareth Carrol","text":"The vocabulary of the internet, even the word \u2018internet\u2019, is relatively modern\u2026 the idea of breaking the internet is now a phrase I think people would use and recognise, so something that causes such a stir online that metaphorically so many people rush to a website that it threatens to bring it down, something like that\u2026"},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"In the early days we had \u2018go viral\u2019 which has stayed with us, hasn\u2019t it?"},{"author":"Dr Gareth Carrol","text":"Yeah, so the idea of something going viral is certainly very much in the vocabulary now\u2026 But things like Twitter have leant sort of phrases, so the idea of first-world problems, meaning sort of ironically things that we complain about but actually, compared to other parts of the world, may well be relatively minor, that started life as Twitter hashtag, for example."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Another modern idiom is breaking the internet \u2013 causing so much excitement about something online that too many people visit the website at the same time, making it crash."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Social media outlets like Twitter have also created their own idioms, including first-world problems - a trivial problem that does not seem very important when compared to the serious problems faced by people in poorer parts of the world."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If you don\u2019t know some of these idioms, don\u2019t worry. Unlike general vocabulary, a native speaker\u2019s full knowledge of idioms takes longer to develop, usually at around the age of thirty to forty."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Meanwhile, you can still rely on classic English idioms, like \u2018pull my leg\u2019, \u2018kick the bucket\u2019, and \u2018throw in the towel\u2019 \u2013 which, I think, comes from the sport of boxing. Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, in my question I asked which sport gave birth to the phrase \u2018throw in the towel\u2019, and Sam\u2019s answer was correct! Well done! The idiom \u2018throw in the towel\u2019 comes from boxing where the coach of losing boxer would literally throw a towel into the ring to surrender."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the rest of the idioms, old and new, that we\u2019ve learnt today. To spend a penny is an old-fashioned way of saying \u2018go to the toilet\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Groundhog Day describes a situation in which events that have happened before, happen again exactly the same way."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If something is ubiquitous , it seems to appear everywhere."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The modern idiom break the internet, means to cause so much excitement about something online that you make the website crash."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, a first-world problem is a problem that does not seem very important when compared to the serious problems faced by people in poorer parts of the world. Unfortunately for us, our six minutes are up!
