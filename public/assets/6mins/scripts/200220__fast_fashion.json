This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"In this programme, we\u2019re talking about buying clothes and only wearing them a few times before buying more clothes!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"This is something known as fast fashion \u2013 it\u2019s popular, it might make us feel good, but it\u2019s not great for the environment."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which is why lots of people this year are pledging \u2013 or promising publicly - to buy no new clothes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I for one am wearing the same shirt I bought seven years ago."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"You\u2019re certainly not a fashion victim, Neil! But first, let\u2019s test your knowledge of fast fashion with a question. Do you know how many items of clothing were sent to landfill in the UK in 2017? Was it\u2026 a)     23 million items, b)     234 million items or c)      2.3 billion items What do you think, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lots, but not billions, so I\u2019m going to say 23 million items."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I shall tell you if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. Let\u2019s talk more about fast fashion, which is being blamed for contributing to global warming."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And discarded clothes \u2013 that means ones that are thrown away - are also piling up in landfill sites, and fibre fragments are flowing into the sea when clothes are washed."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It\u2019s not great \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard the average time someone wears something is just seven! So why is this, and what is driving our desire to keep buying more clothes?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think we should hear from fashion journalist Lauren Bravo, who\u2019s been speaking on the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours. She explained that clothes today are relatively cheaper than those from her parents\u2019 days\u2026"},{"author":"Lauren Bravo, fashion journalist","text":"A lot of clothing production got outsourced - offshored over to the developing world, so countries like Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and China are now responsible for making the vast bulk of all the clothes that are sold in the UK. And with that, we've seen what we call \u2018chasing the cheapest needle\u2019 around the world, so the fashion industry constantly looking to undercut competitors, and with that clothes getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Right, so clothes \u2013 in the developed world at least \u2013 have become cheaper because they are produced in developing countries. These are countries which are trying to become more advanced economically and socially."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So production is outsourced \u2013 that means work usually done in one company is given to another company to do, often because that company has the skills to do it. And in the case of fashion production, it can be done cheaper by another company based in a developing country."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Lauren used an interesting expression \u2018chasing the cheapest needle\u2019 \u2013 so the fashion industry is always looking to find the company which can make clothes cheaper \u2013  a company that can undercut another one means they can do the same job cheaper."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Therefore the price of clothes gets cheaper for us."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"OK, so it might be good to be able to buy cheaper clothes. But why do we have to buy more \u2013 and only wear items a few times?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s all about our obsession with shopping and fashion. It\u2019s something Lauren Bravo goes on to explain on the You and Yours radio programme. See if you can hear what she blames for this obsession\u2026"},{"author":"Lauren Bravo, fashion journalist","text":"Buying new things has almost become a trend in itself for certain generations. I think that feeling that you can't be seen in the same thing twice, it really stems from social media, particularly. And quite often people are buying those outfits to take a photo to put on Instagram. It sounds illogical , but I think when all of your friends are doing it there is this invisible pressure there."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Lauren makes some interesting points. Firstly, for some generations, there is just a trend for buying things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It does seem very wasteful, but, as Lauren says, some people don\u2019t like to be seen wearing the same thing twice. And this idea is caused by social media \u2013 she uses the expression \u2018 stems from\u2019."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"She describes the social pressure of needing to be seen wearing new clothes on Instagram. And the availability of cheap clothes means it\u2019s possible to post new images of yourself wearing new clothes very regularly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm, it sounds very wasteful and to me, illogical \u2013 not reasonable or sensible and more driven by emotions rather than any practical reason."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But, there is a bit of a backlash now \u2013 that\u2019s a strong negative reaction to what is happening. Some people are now promising to buy second-hand clothes, or \u2018vintage clothes\u2019, or make do with the clothes they have and mend the ones they need. It could be the start of a new fashion trend."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, and for once, I will be on trend ! And it could reduce the amount of clothes sent to landfill that you mentioned earlier."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, I asked if you knew how many items of clothing were sent to landfill in the UK in 2017? Was it\u2026 a)     23 million items, b)     234 million items or c)      2.3 billion items What did you say, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said a) 23 million items."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And you were wrong. It\u2019s actually 234 million items \u2013 that\u2019s according to the Enviro Audit Committee. It also found that 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon emissions is released by the global fashion industry."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we\u2019re clearly throwing away too many clothes but perhaps we can recycle some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned today?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I think we can, starting with pledging - that means publicly promising to do something. You can make a pledge to do something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When something is outsourced ,it is given to another company to do, often because that company has the skills to do it or it can be done cheaper."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And if one company undercuts another, it charges less to do a job than its competitor."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The expression stems from means \u2018is caused by\u2019 or \u2018a result of\u2019. We mentioned that rise in fast fashion stems from sharing images on Instagram."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And we mentioned this being illogical . So it seems unreasonable - not sensible, and more driven by emotions rather than any practical reason."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And a backlash is a strong negative reaction to what is happening."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And that brings us to the end of our discussion about fast fashion!
