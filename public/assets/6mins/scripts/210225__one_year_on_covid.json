In 1918/1919 another major virus known as Spanish flu, swept across the world. Do you know approximately, how many people were infected by it? Was it\u2026"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, I know it was bad, so I\u2019m going for the awful number of 500 million."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the right answer later on. Now, back to the current coronavirus pandemic. It was only at the end of December 2019 when reports of a new flu-like infection first came out of China. Within weeks, millions of people were in lockdown as the virus took hold around the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Took hold means it became stronger and was difficult to stop. We all had to change the way we lived to stop it spreading. But while we played our part by washing our hands, wearing masks and staying at home, some people were busy working for a solution to fight this deadly virus."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You\u2019re talking about the scientists, Georgina. Their response was immediate and it\u2019s something the BBC World Service programme Science in Action has been reflecting on."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"At the beginning of the outbreak, Jenny Rohn, a virologist from University College London, spoke to the programme about her concerns if the virus turned out to be like flu. Here\u2019s what she said\u2026"},{"author":"Jenny Rohn, virologist, University College London","text":"Seasonal flu is a huge killer and you\u2019ve probably seen the numbers, it makes the Wuhan virus look a bit wimpy , that\u2019s simply because of the sheer number of people that flu infects every year. And if the Wuhan virus started spreading like that and going all over the world, you would see a lot of people dead. This is why people are worried."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So we know flu is a virus that can spread easily and can affect many many people. This is why, at the time, comparing it with the new coronavirus made Covid look \u2018 wimpy\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a word to describe something or someone that\u2019s feeble - not very strong."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, Jenny called the great or significant numbers of people affected by flu as sheer numbers . The fear at the time was if coronavirus spread like flu, it would kill many people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we all know what happened next \u2013 it did spread. But, working behind the scenes, scientists developed tests we could use to see if we were infected."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But the main challenge was to develop a vaccine that could stop us becoming infected altogether. This involved people around the world working together to share information."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This work started straight away and Dr Peter Dazak, Zoologist and President of EcoHealth Alliance, told the Science in Action programme that this initial response in China helped with the development of a vaccine\u2026"},{"author":"Dr Peter Dazak, Zoologist and President of EcoHealth Alliance","text":"Despite what everyone says, you know, they had a system to find unusual pneumonia cases. We now think that that system kicked in , maybe not on the first actual case of Covid, but certainly within a couple of months of the first case, it seems. So that\u2019s quite quick. And then from that point, to actually getting a full genome , genetic sequence of the virus, was very quick \u2013 and getting that published and publically available \u2013 and then rapidly developing diagnostic tests and vaccines now \u2013 that\u2019s really worked well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So China had a scientific system which kicked in \u2013 or started happening \u2013 quite quickly. Within a few months of the first coronavirus outbreak, experts began to work out the full genome of the virus \u2013 that\u2019s the full amount of genetic information of something."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"This genetic information was made publically available and helped towards the development of various vaccines that we see now \u2013 which is hopefully our way out of this pandemic."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s hope so, Georgina. The science is amazing and is explained in more detail in the BBC\u2019s Science in Action programme. But now let\u2019s get back to our quiz question. Earlier I asked you how many people were infected by Spanish flu back in 1918/1919?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I guessed 500 million. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were, Georgina. An incredible 500 million people around the world were infected by the Spanish flu virus and over 50 million people died worldwide."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, the death toll from coronavirus hasn\u2019t been that bad, but is still a significant number."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, well we\u2019ve just time to recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed today. Starting with pandemic \u2013 a disease that affects many people around the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"When something took hold , it means it became stronger and was difficult to stop."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The word wimpy describes something or someone that\u2019s feeble or not very strong."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Something that is sheer is great or significant \u2013 so sheer numbers means a great amount of something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When something kicks in it starts to happen."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And a genome is the full amount of genetic information of something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we\u2019re out of time but there\u2019s lots more 6 Minute English programmes to enjoy on our website at bbclearningenglish.com."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And if you like topical discussions and want to learn how to use the vocabulary found in headlines, why not try out our News Review podcast?
