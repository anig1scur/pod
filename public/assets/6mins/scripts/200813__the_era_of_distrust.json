Generally speaking, trust can be described as a judgement that someone can be believed and relied upon.

Here he is speaking to David Edmonds, presenter of the BBC World Service programme, The Big Idea :"},{"author":"Onora O\u2019Neill","text":"We have another word, which is gullible , and if you simply place trust indiscriminately without making a judgement about whether the other person or institution is trustworthy then just trusting to luck as we say, is probably not a virtue."},{"author":"Rob","text":"There\u2019s a difference between trusting someone because you have good reason to believe them and being gullible \u2013 that's easy to deceive because you trust and believe people too quickly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you don\u2019t judge who is trustworthy and who is not, you are trusting to luck \u2013 simply believing or hoping that things will happen for the best."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But being gullible and trusting to luck is exactly how Bernie Madoff was able to trick so many people into giving him their money. Their biggest mistake was to trust him indiscriminately - in a way that does not show care or judgement, usually with harmful results."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, if indiscriminately trusting people is such a bad idea, how do we avoid it? How can we tell who is trustworthy and who is not? Here\u2019s BBC World Service\u2019s The Big Idea presenter, David Edmonds, asking Onora O\u2019Neill to give some details:"},{"author":"David Edmonds","text":"An individual or organisation is trustworthy is they can justifiably be trusted. To be trustworthy they need three ingredients. First, honesty \u2013 people have to be able to believe what they\u2019re told. Second, competence . Beyond honesty and competence there\u2019s a third element to trustworthiness: reliability ."},{"author":"Onora O\u2019Neill","text":"That\u2019s the boring one.

You would trust a car mechanic to fix your broken car engine, but you wouldn\u2019t go to them for dental work \u2013 they\u2019re not competent to remove your tooth like a dentist is."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And you wouldn\u2019t trust your dentist to fix your broken down car, either!

Do you remember, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yep, I do. You asked how much Bernie Madoff stole from the American investors he lied to. And I said b) 65 million dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But in fact it was c) 65 billion dollars \u2013 a lot of money to give to such an untrustworthy man!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"So we\u2019ve been discussing whether there is a crisis of trust and asking how to know who is trustworthy \u2013 able to be trusted as honest, competent and reliable."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Placing your trust in someone trustworthy is very different from being gullible \u2013 easy to trick because you trust and believe people too quickly."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And it can also be unhelpful to trust things to luck \u2013 simply hope or believe that everything will work out for the best."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Both of these problems come about when people trust indiscriminately - in an unsystematic way that does not show care or judgement, usually with harmful results \u2013 as Bernie Madoff\u2019s victims found out to their cost."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But luckily there are many trustworthy people around and we can spot them using three criteria:  honesty, in other words not lying; competence ; and reliability ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Competence means an ability to do something well, in the correct and effective way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And reliability means being honest and competent , all the time, not just being honest sometimes or reliable in some actions but not others."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for 6 Minute English.
