I'm Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And hello. I'm Rob."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Rob, you are a man who enjoys travel. What\u2019s the furthest journey you\u2019ve ever made?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I have been to the other side of the world. I've been to Australia, New Zealand \u2013 so from London that's a very long way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And how was it?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, it was pretty boring really and quite cramped on the aeroplane \u2013 but I loved it when I got there."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So how would you feel about a journey of 56 million kilometres that took around nine months?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right. I'd have to travel Business Class, I think - lots of movies and a very comfortable seat!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s how long it would take to get to the planet Mars and this programme is all about the women who want to be the first to set foot on the red planet. First, though, today\u2019s question, which is about the size of Mars. Is it \u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019m pretty sure I know this. It\u2019s bigger than Earth, much bigger I think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. It\u2019s been 40 years since NASA first recruited women to be astronauts. Today, a third of the people who work at NASA are women."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, and 2016 was the first year that there were an equal number of women and men joining as astronaut trainees."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Equality is slowly coming but only men have had the opportunity to walk on the Moon, although that was over 45 years ago. Karen Nyberg is one of NASA\u2019s current astronauts. In a recent BBC News feature she talked about her hopes. When did she join the astronaut programme?"},{"author":"Karen Nyberg, NASA Astronaut","text":"When I was selected as an astronaut in the year 2000 I thought that that might be a realistic possibility , that we would be the ones, the next to go to the Moon. So it's unfortunate that we weren't."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When did she become an astronaut?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, she said that she was selected in 2000. ' Selected' means chosen."},{"author":"Neil","text":"At that time, when she was selected , she thought going to the Moon would be a realistic possibility . So she thought that it wasn\u2019t just a dream, but something that could happen. There was a good chance it would happen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"However, she was disappointed because that opportunity didn\u2019t arrive at that time. She describes that as being unfortunate . In this sense ' unfortunate' means unlucky. If you use this adjective it means you are disappointed about something, but you do perhaps understand the reason for it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So far, a woman hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to step on the Moon. These days Mars is the big target for space travel. There are many problems to overcome, but could it, should it be a woman who is the first person to take that step?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Absolutely, why not? On a mission to Mars there would be need for many different kinds of specialists. We tend to think of astronauts as spaceship pilots, but really I think they are much more like scientists, carrying out different experiments."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If we are going to set up a base on Mars, one thing that would be very important is to try to find a way of growing food. For that you need people with skills in those areas. One person with those skills is Gioia Massa, a Life Science project manager for NASA. Now you would think that being a top scientist she would be brilliant at all areas or aspects of the job, but she told BBC News that it wasn\u2019t always the case. What two aspects does she mention she wasn\u2019t good at?"},{"author":"Gioia Massa,\u00a0Life Science project manager for NASA","text":"Gioia Massa, Life Science project manager for NASA There certainly were aspects where I was challenged, you know. I wasn't as great in math as some of my colleagues, my handwriting is terrible. So there are things that are not my strength . But then I fell in love with plants and plants were my strength , I really learned and focused on that."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So Rob, what did she have problems with?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, she said that she wasn\u2019t good at math . ' Math' is a North American English word for what in British English, we call maths. Both words mean mathematics, so ' math' in American English, 'maths' in British English."},{"author":"Neil","text":"She also said that her handwriting is terrible!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Mind you, if her handwriting was really terrible, maybe nobody would be able to read her bad maths!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Good point! So handwriting and maths aren\u2019t or weren\u2019t her strengths . They are not what she is good at. What are her strengths ?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, the thing she is good at, her real strengths are working with plants, so that\u2019s what she concentrated on."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. Well, let\u2019s see if one of your strengths is the knowledge of the planets. Today\u2019s quiz question was: Is Mars\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said that it was bigger, much bigger."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the answer, I'm afraid to say, is that Mars is smaller than Earth, much smaller in fact."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh, well, I guess I won\u2019t be selected to be an astronaut any time soon!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Before we blast off out of here, let\u2019s review the vocabulary we covered today. The first word was the one you just mentioned, ' selected' , meaning chosen."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Then we had the phrase, ' a realistic possibility' to describe something that has a good chance of happening, unlike my astronaut application!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if you did become an astronaut, that would be unfortunate , our next word, for me at least."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Unfortunate, you mean disappointing for you?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, if you were up in space I wouldn\u2019t have the pleasure of your company."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hashtag blushing. Our next word was ' aspects 'meaning parts of something and then the Americanisation, ' math '."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which we call maths, or mathematics in British English. And finally we had ' strengths '. And maths certainly isn\u2019t one of my strengths \u2013 it\u2019s not something I\u2019m good at."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But one of your strengths is saying nice things about people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hashtag double blush. Well, time for us to go \u2013 not to Mars, but to lunch! Just time to say you can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com!  Thank you for joining us and goodbye!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Rob","Karen Nyberg, NASA Astronaut","Gioia Massa,\u00a0Life Science project manager for
