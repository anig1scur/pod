This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You may have one, or know someone who does\u2026 and at one time you\u2019ve been one yourself. I\u2019m talking about toddlers."},{"author":"Beth","text":"A toddler is a young child usually between two and four years old who is learning to walk, or \u2018toddling\u2019. It\u2019s an important stage in a child\u2019s development as they learn to move and understand the world around them."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s also known as the \u2018terrible twos\u2019. When toddlers can\u2019t do the things they want to they experience frustration which often leads to tantrums, a sudden and noisy outburst of anger. We\u2019ve probably all seen the tears and screams when a young child can\u2019t have what they want!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Yes, the famous temper tantrums! But being a toddler is also an exciting time as a child\u2019s personality starts to develop. So what can we adults learn from toddlers? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be finding out in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first I have a question for you, Beth. Being a toddler is certainly an important stage in a child\u2019s growth, but which of the following statements is true?"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Hmm, I think toddlers can grow up to three centimetres while they sleep."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Beth, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the correct answer later in the programme. At two or three years old, there\u2019s not much toddlers can do for themselves. They depend on mum or dad to feed, clothe and care for them, so it\u2019s strange to think there\u2019s anything adults could learn."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But not according to Dr Hasan Merali, author of a new book \u2018Sleep Well, Take Risks, Squish the Peas\u2019 and father to his own toddler, who spoke with BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman\u2019s Hour:"},{"author":"Dr Hasan Merali","text":"When I see the toddlers by themselves they're doing a lot of things out loud . Little Julie\u2019s putting on her mitts and saying, \u201cJulie can do it\u201d. And Coltan\u2019s over in the side, and he's looking down at his boots, and they're on the wrong way, and so he says \u201cOh, Coltan did this wrong!\u201d And this idea of self-talk is really a way to decrease stress in anxiety provoking situations."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Merali observed toddlers talking to themselves out loud . When you talk out loud you speak so that other people can hear you."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But it\u2019s what the toddlers were saying that\u2019s really interesting. When a little girl called Julie learned how to put on her gloves, she told herself, \u2018Julie can do it!\u2019 This is a special kind of talking out loud known as self-talk. Self-talk means the messages that you tell yourself, and the way in which you tell them. It\u2019s your inner voice, and in toddlers it\u2019s usually positive and encouraging."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Unfortunately, as we grow up our self-talk often becomes less encouraging and more critical. Instead of a positive, loving inner voice, as adults we tend to tell ourselves: \u2018You can\u2019t do it!\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re no good!\u2019 Here\u2019s Dr Merali again, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman\u2019s Hour:"},{"author":"Dr Hasan Merali","text":"We often get into the cycle of negative self-talk, and I think one of the best strategies that we can do is give ourselves more positive self-talk, so an easy way to do it is when you're down on yourself , and angry with yourself, think about talking to yourself as a good friend instead of actually you, and you'll notice that difference in how you talk to yourself."},{"author":"Beth","text":"As an adult, you might be down on yourself. If you\u2019re down on yourself , you feel disappointed and self-critical about yourself. When this happens your self-talk gets very negative, for example telling yourself you\u2019re no good, and this can lead to a negative cycle , a pattern of repeating the same negative thoughts over and over again."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This can be a problem, but not for toddlers who are naturally good at talking kindly to themselves and celebrating the little things, like learning to get dressed. The solution for over-critical grown-ups? According to Dr Merali, pretend you\u2019re talking to a good friend instead of to yourself, just like toddlers do!"},{"author":"Beth","text":"It seems us adults can learn something from young children, after all \u2013 being kind to ourselves. When they\u2019re not having tantrums, toddlers really are wonderful little creatures, which reminds me of your question, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, I asked you which statement about toddlers was true."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I said it was that toddlers can grow up to three centimetres while they sleep. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think you know that you're not right, Beth! That was the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s true that toddlers do grow when sleeping, but not as much as three centimetres. In fact, the correct answer was that being a toddler is the most active period of your whole life \u2013 which isn\u2019t hard to believe if you live with one! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned in this programme about toddlers, young children who are \u2018toddling\u2019 or learning to walk."},{"author":"Beth","text":"A tantrum is a noisy, uncontrolled outburst of anger, usually from a young child."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you say something out loud , you say it in a way that other people can hear."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Self-talk refers to the messages that you tell yourself, and the way in which you tell them. It\u2019s your inner voice."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The phrase to be down on yourself means to feel disappointed and self-critical about yourself."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, a negative cycle is a pattern of repeating the same negative thoughts over and over again, something a toddler would never do! Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Dr Hasan
