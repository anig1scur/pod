This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Sam","text":"How good are you at finding your way from A to B, Rob? Can you read a map?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Come on, Sam, this is the 21st century!  Everyone uses GPS and mobile phone apps to find their way around these days."},{"author":"Sam","text":"True, but before mobile phones where invented arriving at your destination wasn\u2019t so easy. At sea, sailors used the stars and Sun to navigate \u2013 to work out which direction they wanted to travel. And navigating on land was almost impossible without a compass \u2013 an instrument for finding directions that uses a magnetic needle which moves to always point north."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But, as we\u2019ll be hearing in this programme, navigation at sea is easy compared to finding your way in outer space. After all, what\u2019s up and what\u2019s down for astronauts who are floating in zero gravity? In space is there a true north, like here on Earth? And how is everything complicated by the fact that all the stars and planets are moving?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Some big questions there, Rob, but first I have a question of my own. You asked how astronauts know which way is up, so who better to ask than the first person in space? But who was that? Was it: a)    Neil Armstrong? b)    Yuri Gagarin? or c)    Valentina Tereshkova?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Neil Armstrong was the first man on the Moon, but I don\u2019t think he was the first person in space. So I think it\u2019s b) Yuri Gagarin."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now let\u2019s get back to Rob\u2019s earlier question about whether there\u2019s such a thing as north in space. And to answer that it\u2019s first useful to know how north is found on Earth."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Listen as astrophysicist Ethan Siegal as he explains why a compass always points north to BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience."},{"author":"Ethan Siegal","text":"\u2026because Earth behaves like it has a giant bar magnet in it, and your compass needle will point north towards Earth\u2019s magnetic pole. And we\u2019ve arbitrarily defined north as, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to say \u2018up\u2019 is, like, the North Pole \u2013 that\u2019s as \u2018up\u2019 as you can go."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Planet Earth is like a giant magnet. Because the needle of a compass is magnetised, it\u2019s attracted to the magnetic pole \u2013 the points near the North and South Poles where the Earth\u2019s magnetic field is concentrated."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This explains how we find north, but Ethan points out that the decision to call north \u2018up\u2019 and south \u2018down\u2019 is arbitrary \u2013 decided by random chance, not based on any particular reason."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When we look at a world map, we think of north as \u2018up\u2019, the USA in the northern hemisphere is above Brazil, in the southern hemisphere. But from space, Earth can just as easily be seen the other way up, with Australia, South Africa and South America at the top. Both views are equally true."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Wow, that\u2019s a mind-blowing thought! But even though we can argue which direction is up, it\u2019s still true that we can use a compass to navigate on Earth. However, this simply isn\u2019t true in space. Here\u2019s astrophysicist Ethan Siegal again to tell BBC World Service\u2019s CrowdScience why:"},{"author":"Ethan Siegal","text":"The problem with navigating in space is that the magnetic field flips irregularly every few hundred, or few thousand light years . There\u2019s no central object like the black hole at the centre of our galaxy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t dominate the whole galaxy, it doesn\u2019t make a magnetic field that you can feel out here 25, 27-thousand light years from the centre. So, magnetism is not a good guide to navigating in space."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A light year sounds like a measurement of time, but in fact it measures the distance that light travels in one year \u2013 which, given that light can travel 7.5 times around the Earth in one second , is a very, very long way - around 6 trillion miles, in fact."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, the problem is that every few hundred light years the magnetic field flips - turns over or moves into a different position. So, a compass, which depends on magnetism, is no good for navigating in space."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So how do spacecraft know where they are, and which way to go? The answer is both simple and very clever \u2013 they use specialised heat sensors to detect the position of the Sun and use that to guide their way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So simple yet so ingenious! I\u2019m sure it would have impressed the first person in space, whoever they were."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, in my question I asked who the first person in space was."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And I said it was b) Yuri Gagarin. I\u2019ve got to be right, haven\u2019t I?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"It was right, of course! Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space in 1961, with Valentina Tereshkova following in his footsteps to become the first woman in space two years later."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme on how to navigate \u2013 or find your way - in space."},{"author":"Sam","text":"On Earth you can use a compass \u2013 an instrument with a magnetic needle that moves to point north, that is towards to the magnetic pole \u2013 a point near the North or South Poles where Earth\u2019s magnetic field is strongest."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Saying that north is \u2018up\u2019 is arbitrary \u2013 done randomly, not according to any particular reason or principle."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A light year is a unit measuring the distance that light travels in one year - around 6 trillion miles."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally, to flip means to turn over or move into a different position."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Once again, our time is up. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye bye!"}],"authors":["Sam","Rob","Ethan
