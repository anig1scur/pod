If someone has an injury, like a broken leg or a serious medical issue, it\u2019s obvious, and we can understand what\u2019s happening. With mental health issues, though, there\u2019s no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties maybe don\u2019t get the same understanding as people who have medical problems."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s a topic that has been getting more publicity recently, particularly as members of the British royal family have been talking about it. Also, awareness is raised through events such as World Mental Health Day. And that is the topic of today\u2019s quiz. World Mental Health Day is held every year on October 10th. It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues and their effects on people\u2019s lives. In what year was it first held?

Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them, and they also have an impact on businesses. Paul Farmer is head of the mental health awareness charity Mind. He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily programme about this. How much does he says it costs businesses in the UK?"},{"author":"Paul Farmer, CEO Mind","text":"We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal . In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year, about $50 billion dollars, and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year as a result of poor mental health. So that\u2019s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals. Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of talented, able, contributors who often just slide away from the workplace because they don\u2019t get the right help and support for their mental health."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What figures did Paul Farmer give there?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"He gave the figure of about between 33 and \u00a342 billion \u2013 which is about $50 billion dollars."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s a lot of money!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It is \u2013 in fact he called it colossal . This adjective means huge \u2013 really, really big. This is the cost to business he says of failing to address the mental health issue."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Failing to address means ignoring or not dealing with the problems. It leads to staff leaving work, and he says these people are contributors , they give something to the business in terms of their skill and experience."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And because of mental health issues, which could be addressed but aren\u2019t, those contributors are being lost to the business. So it costs companies more money to recruit and train new staff, and you can\u2019t always replace the experience that is lost."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s listen again."},{"author":"Paul Farmer, CEO Mind","text":"We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal .

Geoff McDonald is a campaigner for the organisation Minds at Work. He also spoke on the Business Daily programme about one way that things were getting a little better."},{"author":"Geoff McDonald, Minds at Work","text":"I think what\u2019s really changed is people telling their stories, and the more stories that we tell it kind of begins to normalise this. Every single story that we tell is like sending a lifeboat out into the ocean and the millions and millions of people who are suffering in silence , do you know what they do? They cling on to that lifeboat and they realise they\u2019re not alone and they might just be normal."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, because more people are talking about this issue, it begins to normalise it.
