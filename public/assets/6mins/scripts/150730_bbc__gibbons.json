I'm Rob\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And hello! I'm Neil."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well I\u2019m sitting right next to you, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Very funny. Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called primates .  The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don\u2019t."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I didn\u2019t know that. On a serious note\u2026 I had a close shave with some monkeys once in Bali."},{"author":"Rob","text":"A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. If you screech at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that face-off , then!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, today\u2019s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. Gibbons are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil\u2019s monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Musical apes \u2013 that\u2019s nice! So how about today\u2019s quiz question, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon\u2019s voice travel through the forest? Is it\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I\u2019m going to say b) 1km."},{"author":"Rob","text":"You\u2019ve never heard one."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Never heard one\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK. We\u2019ll find out later on in the programme whether you\u2019re right or wrong. Now let\u2019s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like."},{"author":"Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University ","text":"Interviewer: Let\u2019s just hear this. [gibbons calling] That\u2019s an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn\u2019t it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is \u2026 I said talking to each other."},{"author":"Dr Clarke:","text":"Well this is their\u2026 They\u2019re singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups\u2026"},{"author":"Interviewer:","text":"What we call a duet."},{"author":"Dr Clarke:","text":"Yes, absolutely. And they\u2019ll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So the gibbons make an evocative sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It is. And what\u2019s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs \u2013 one male and one female. They are singing duets together. So a duet is a song sung by two people \u2013 or in this case, sung by two gibbons!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time \u2013 which Dr Clarke describes as a cacophony . Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And that could easily describe us singing together!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Let\u2019s not do that."},{"author":"Rob","text":"But what\u2019s the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which territory \u2013 or bit of land \u2013 belongs to a pair or group of gibbons."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Gibbons also use different sounds to alert \u2013 or warn \u2013 other gibbons about danger from predators \u2013 these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call for an eagle."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You\u2019re very good at that Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now let\u2019s hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?"},{"author":"Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University","text":"Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same ancestor ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right. And ancestor means an animal \u2013 or human \u2013 from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used context-specific calls like modern gibbons \u2013 then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for \u2018leopard\u2019 and another for \u2018eagle\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And evolutionary means a gradual process of change or development."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, let\u2019s have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon\u2019s voice travel through the forest? Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said b) 1km."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today\u2019s words again maybe in a gibbon's voice Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019ll do it in a human voice."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Thank you. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
