Inside the bag is dog poo."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It might make it seem that humans are hygienic creatures - certainly cleaner than dogs, who go to the toilet wherever they want. But is this the whole story?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"How do us humans compare with other animals when it comes to keeping ourselves and our environment clean? In this programme, we\u2019ll be asking whether humans as a species are naturally clean and tidy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In fact, from dumping raw sewage into rivers to littering the streets with trash, humans aren\u2019t always good at dealing with waste."},{"author":"Neil","text":"While some animals, on the other hand, are instinctively clean."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Right - cats for example dig a hole to bury their poo."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the past, humans got rid of their waste by throwing it into the street or into streams and rivers, hoping the water would wash it away."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Out of sight out of mind ! That\u2019s a phrase used to say that it\u2019s easier to forget something when you can\u2019t see it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But this doesn\u2019t always work, as we\u2019ll discover from my quiz question, Sam. In Victorian times, the population of London boomed and so did all the pee and poo being thrown into the River Thames. It got so bad that by the 1850s the awful smell had its own name \u2013 but what? Was it: A) The Great Stench?, B) The Great Stink?,  or C) The Great Smell?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ugh! All sounds pretty disgusting, Neil, but I\u2019ll go for A) The Great Stench."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right later. Earlier you mentioned cats as examples of animals who hide their waste, but leaf-cutter ants go even further: they kill any dirty ants trying to re-enter the group!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Zoologist, Professor Adam Hart, has spent years studying ants and other clean creatures. Here he is speaking with BBC World Service programme, The Conversation:"},{"author":"Prof Adam Hart","text":"Some animals, you\u2019ll be watching, and it is just pouring out of the back end and they don\u2019t seem to care. Other animals will go to quite great lengths to go to a specific area. Some antelope for example will go to a sort of latrine area. It\u2019s really linked to their ecology so quite often animals are using dung and also urine as marking posts and territorial markers to say to other groups of animals and other individuals that, well, this is my territory not yours."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like cats and ants, antelopes go to great lengths, meaning they try very hard to do something, in this case to leave their poo - or dung - in a specific area, away from their home."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Antelopes leave smells, called territorial markers , secreted in urine, or pee, to tell other animals that an area of land is already occupied."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK Sam, but just because most of us don\u2019t pee at the bottom of the garden, does that necessarily mean humans are dirtier?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, no, not according to psychologist, Dr Michael De Barra. He thinks that human attitudes to cleanliness are related to the problem of infectious diseases, something we\u2019ve all experienced during the Covid pandemic."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here is Dr De Barra, explaining more to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Conversation:"},{"author":"Dr Michael De Barra","text":"So, in humans it seems like the emotion disgust is a big part of how we deal with infectious diseases problems. It\u2019s characterised by avoidance, by sometimes feelings of nausea and what\u2019s interesting about it is that it is elicited by many of the things that are infectious disease threats in our environment\u2026 so that might be particular smells, or particular substances, body wastes, physical signs of infectious disease \u2013 coughs, sneezes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Our natural reaction to something which is dirty, and which therefore may be diseased and harmful to us, is disgust \u2013 a strong feeling of dislike or repulsion."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We might feel so disgusted at the sight or smell of human waste that we actually want to vomit \u2013 a feeling known as nausea ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"These bodily reactions are the immune system\u2019s way of saying: keep away! \u2013 this will make you sick!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, although getting a bit dirty won\u2019t kill you (unless you\u2019re a leaf-cutter ant), human evolution has developed a psychological way of keeping us clean. What\u2019s the matter, Sam? You look a little green!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I am, Neil! All this talk of pee and poo is disgusting! And just image how bad it must\u2019ve been in the old days."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Like in Victorian times before the invention of modern sewers and sanitation. In my quiz question I asked you what people called the awful smell in London in the 1850s."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said it was A) The Great Stench. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were\u2026 wrong! In fact, the answer was B) The Great Stink, which stunk up the River Thames all the way to Westminster. It was only when the smell reached the noses of politicians in Parliament that something was done about it\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"\u2026so starting another useful phrase \u2013 to raise a stink about something , meaning to make a strong public complaint."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the other vocabulary, starting with out of sight, out of mind, a phrase meaning that it\u2019s easier to forget something when you can\u2019t see it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"To go to great lengths means to try very hard to achieve something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Territorial markers are smells in animals\u2019 dung or urine marking their territory."},{"author":"Sam","text":"These may fill you with disgust \u2013 a feeling of strong dislike or repulsion. Or even give you nausea - the feeling that you are going to vomit."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And that\u2019s all for this stinky edition of 6 Minute English.
