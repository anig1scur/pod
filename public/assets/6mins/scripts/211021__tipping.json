But now let\u2019s talk more about what happens to your tips once you have given them to someone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It seems that different restaurants and businesses have different systems in place across the country."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And sadly, that isn\u2019t always to the benefit of all waiting staff \u2013 that\u2019s according to James James, a waiter, who was speaking with Peter White on the BBC programme You and Yours."},{"author":"James James, waiter","text":"There\u2019s nothing consistent about the tipping system throughout all the different companies \u2013 they all have their own, and they\u2019re all unfair in their own equal way. A tip is not mandatory - I have to earn it as a reward for the service I provide. People don\u2019t tip for good food, they already paid for it on the bill. Recently, when I\u2019ve been given cash, I\u2019ve been imposed in more than one company to put it in a jar and split it \u2013 the split hasn\u2019t exactly been fair to me. My first week at one job I did \u00a350 in the jar for week \u2013 that was just myself and there\u2019s four other servers. And at the end of the week, I was presented with a bag with \u00a32.45 in it."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, James James used the word consistent \u2013 which means acting the same way over time \u2013 however he used it negatively when talking about the tipping systems in most companies."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He also used mandatory \u2013 which is something someone must do and is the opposite of the word discretionary ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And he also said imposed , which means forced upon someone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, it seems that James James is not impressed by some businesses\u2019 tipping systems. However, for many restaurants there is a special arrangement with the UK tax body, the HMRC."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes \u2013 it\u2019s called a tronc system \u2013 which sees all of the tips collected in one separate independent bank account and stops the payments being charged at the wrong rate of tax."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Kate Nicholls, a representative for UK Hospitality, speaking with Peter White on the BBC programme You and Yours, explains more about the intention of a tronc system."},{"author":"Kate\u00a0Nicholls from UK Hospitality","text":"Kate Nicholls from UK Hospitality Well increasingly, as we\u2019re moving towards a cashless society \u2013 increased use of credit card, particularly over the Covid pandemic, more and more of those tips, gratuities, service charges are coming through on a credit card payment, and a tronc is a special arrangement organised with HMRC that lets businesses pool tips and service charges and then fairly distribute them."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Kate Nicholls mentioned that society is becoming cashless \u2013 which means fewer people are using paper notes or coins to pay for things, preferring to use credit cards."},{"author":"Neil","text":"She also used the verb pool \u2013 a word which means collect together or group. It\u2019s very interesting to note that payments which you give to one person may be distributed equally across the business, from kitchen staff to management \u2013 depending on a business\u2019s protocol."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But that brings me back to today\u2019s question. I asked you how high up is the world\u2019s highest restaurant."},{"author":"Neil","text":"You certainly did and they all sounded exceptionally high up \u2013 I went for option c) 622 metres in the air \u2013 the tallest option.

At.mosphere is actually 442 metres in the air, so not quite as high as you thought."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, it still sounds pretty high to me! Now it\u2019s time to recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned today.
