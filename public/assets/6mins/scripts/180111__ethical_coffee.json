I'm Dan and joining me today is Catherine. Hey Catherine. Catherine Hey Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"So Catherine, do you prefer a brew or a cup of joe in the morning?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, if you are referring to whether I prefer a cup of tea, which we sometimes call \u2018a brew\u2019, or a cup of coffee, sometimes called \u2018a cup of joe\u2019, I prefer my coffee in the morning."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I only drink coffee when I really need to wake up quickly."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And, why are you asking, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Because it\u2019s part of this 6 Minute English."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Coffee. I see. So how do you take it then, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I\u2019m an instant coffee kind of guy. And I like mine with a dash of milk. How about you?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"A dash of something is a small amount of something, especially liquid. Personally, I prefer freshly-ground coffee beans, and I like my coffee dark and strong -  preferably Colombian or maybe Brazilian."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Wow. A coffee aficionado , eh?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"An aficionado is a person who\u2019s very enthusiastic about, or interested in, a particular subject."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, let me test your knowledge with this week\u2019s quiz question. The specialty coffee, Kopi luwak, is made from coffee beans which have already passed through an animal\u2019s digestive system. But which animal?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I\u2019m always going to answer b) a cat. Did you say this coffee actually goes through the animal? As in, it eats it and then it comes out the other end, and that\u2019s what we use for the coffee?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, yes. It is actually one of the most expensive coffees in the world. Anyway, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right or not later on. So, talking of expensive, do you tend to pay more for your coffee or are you happy with the cheap as chips stuff?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Cheap as chips means very cheap. And personally, I do actually like a quality product, and I am willing to pay a bit more for it."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Would you be willing to pay even more than you already do if it meant that the farmer who grew the beans was getting a fairer price?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I would because I think that that sort of thing is important."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you aren\u2019t alone.  There is a growing trend among many Western customers of artisan cafes to be willing to pay more for ethically produced coffee."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Ethical means morally right. So, Dan, why is this trend happening at the moment?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, it\u2019s probably been going on for a while, but a new report from the UN\u2019s World Intellectual Property Organisation has observed the effect that smarter processing, branding and marketing has had on the farmers and their communities."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And because of this, coffee drinkers are better able to choose ethically produced coffee that puts more money in the hands of the farmers. But, Dan, do the farmers actually see any of this money?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, it\u2019s complicated. The price of the coffee is relatively cheap until it\u2019s been roasted \u2013 or cooked in an oven. As a result, roasters take most of the profits. But there is still a difference. I\u2019ll let Johnathan Josephs, a business reporter for the BBC News explain."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Jonathan Josephs , Business reporter, BBC News For a pound of coffee beans that end up in the instants (section) sold in supermarkets, the roaster can get over $4. But the export price is just $1.45. The farmer gets most of that. But when the new wave of socially-aware customer pays a premium for higher standards, the roaster can get $17.45, but the export price also rises to $5.14."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"A premium is an amount that\u2019s more than usual. So the farmer makes three-and-a-half times as much money."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Which means a better quality of life for the farmer, their family and their community."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"That\u2019s good news! I will definitely look for the ethically produced coffee from now on. As long as, Dan, it doesn\u2019t come out of some animal!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Yes, actually that reminds me. Our quiz question. I asked you which animal the speciality coffee Kopi luwak comes from."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"And I said a cat."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you are wrong I\u2019m afraid. Kopi luwak comes from a type of weasel."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I\u2019m kind of relieved about that."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Let\u2019s try not to think about it, and have a look at the vocabulary instead."},{"author":"Catherine","text":"OK. So, first we had dash . A dash of something is a small amount of something, usually a liquid. Where might we talk about a dash of something, Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well, I like my tea with a dash of milk. My gin with a dash of tonic, and my soup with a dash of salt. Then we had aficionado . An aficionado is someone who is very interested or enthusiastic about a subject. What are you an aficionado of?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"I\u2019m working on becoming a bit of an accordion aficionado actually, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Dan Wow, cool!"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Yeah! After that, we had as cheap as chips . Is something as cheap as chips ? Then it is very cheap indeed."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Like my shoes! I bought them at a market for next to nothing. They were as cheap as chips. Then we had ethical . Something which is ethical is morally right. Do you consider yourself to be an ethical person, Catherine?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"Well, I try, Dan. I don\u2019t always get it right, but I do attempt to be. After that we heard roasted . Roasted means cooked in an oven. Like our coffee beans!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And of course our very famous English roast. Finally, we had a premium. If you pay a premium, you pay more than usual - usually for a better quality or service. Can you think of an example?"},{"author":"Catherine","text":"If you\u2019re going to the cinema, you might pay a premium to get more comfortable seats."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And that\u2019s the end of this 6 Minute English. Don\u2019t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages, and we\u2019ll see you next time.
