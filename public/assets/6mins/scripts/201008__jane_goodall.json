Now, when Jane first visited Tanzania in the 1960s most scientists believed the only animals capable of making and using tools were humans. But what Jane witnessed about the behaviour of one chimpanzee, who she named Greybeard, turned this idea on its head. Here she recalls that famous day to Jim Al Khalili, for the podcast of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Discovery programme, The Life Scientific :"},{"author":"Jane Goodall","text":"I could see this black hand picking grass stems and pushing them down into the termite mound and pulling them out with termites clinging on with their jaws. And the following day, I saw him pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves, so not only was he using objects as tools but modifying those objects to make tools."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Jane observed the chimpanzee, Greybeard, finding small wooden branches called twigs and modifying them - changing them slightly in order to improve them."},{"author":"Sam","text":"By stripping away the leaves from twigs and using them to collect ants and termites to eat, Greybeard had madea tool \u2013 an instruments or simple piece of equipment, for example a knife or hammer, that you hold in your hands and use for a particular job."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Previously, it was believed that animals were incapable of making tools on their own. What Jane saw was proof of the intelligence of wild animals. Jane Goodall\u2019s studies convinced her that chimps experience the same range of emotions as humans, as she explains here to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Life Scientific :"},{"author":"Jane Goodall","text":"I wasn\u2019t surprised that chimps had these emotions. It was fascinating to realise how many of their gestures are like ours\u2026 so you can watch them without knowing anything about them and when they greet with a kiss and embrace, they pat one another in reassurance, they hold hands, they seek physical contact to alleviate nervousness or stress \u2013 you know, it\u2019s so like us."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Holding hands, embracing and kissing were some of the chimpanzee\u2019s gestures \u2013movements made with hands, arms or head, to express ideas and feelings."},{"author":"Rob","text":"In the same way as humans, the chimpanzees would pat each other - touch someone gently and repeatedly with their hand held flat."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Much of their behaviour was human-like. Just as I would hug a friend to reassure them, the chimps used physical contact to alleviate stress \u2013 make pain or problems less intense or severe. In fact, chimps are so alike us that sometimes they even get their name in the newspaper!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah yes, Sam, you mean the quiz question I asked you earlier: which chimpanzee had their obituary published in The Times ?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I guessed it was b) Flo."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And that\u2019s absolutely right. Well done, Sam! Give yourself a pat on the back!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK.
