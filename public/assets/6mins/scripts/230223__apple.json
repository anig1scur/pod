I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"English has many proverbs \u2013 short and well-known phrase giving a piece of useful advice, or common sense. For example, the proverb, \u201cActions speak louder than words\u201d means that what people do is more important than what they say."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And the proverb, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d advises people not to form opinions about people based on how they look."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Proverbs are found in many cultures and languages, and are often passed down through the generations to teach children lessons in life. One famous English proverb is: \u201cAn apple a day keeps the doctor away\u201d."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In other words, eating fresh fruit is good for you. But is it really true? Can eating an apple a day actually have significant health benefits? That\u2019s the question we\u2019ll be discussing in this programme, and as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before that I have a question for you, Sam. Most proverbs come from a place\u2019s history, and England has a long history of growing apples. Over the centuries, hundreds of different apple varieties have been grown in orchards up and down the country, some with quite unusual names. So, which of the following is the name of a real type of English apple? Is it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I don\u2019t know but I think it\u2019s b) a Golden pippin."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. But whatever the name of the apple, new scientific research is showing that there really are health benefits to eating apples, especially with the skins on. Apple skins are full of good stuff: fibre, vitamins, and especially flavonoids - a chemical compound known to reduce blood pressure and improve brain and heart health."},{"author":"Sam","text":"No wonder then, that when Dr Michael Mosley, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Just One Thing, wanted a snack to eat, he reached for an apple."},{"author":"Dr Michael Mosley","text":"It's early afternoon and I'm a bit peckish , so I'm about to grab a delicious snack that could improve my blood flow, boost my brain, and trim my waistline. This is not some exotic superfood. In fact, it's an apple."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Mosley wanted something to eat because he was peckish -  a little bit hungry. He wanted something healthy, but chose an apple instead of exotic superfoods like blueberries or a banana smoothie. If you call something exotic , you mean it\u2019s unusual and exciting, often because it comes from an unfamiliar place."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Instead, he ate the least exotic fruit I can imagine - the humble apple. But Dr Mosely thinks apples do have health benefits, and he lists them: apples improve blood flow, boost the brain, and trim the waistline \u2013 a phrase which means to keep a healthy body weight with no extra fat."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, one reason apples are so good for us is that the skin is packed with flavonoids whichhelp people lose weight, and have even been linked to a longer life. But that\u2019s not all. It\u2019s the fact that there are so many different ways of cooking and eating apples which makes them one of the nation\u2019s favourite foods. Here\u2019s Dr Mosley again explaining how he likes to eat his apples to Just One Thing on BBC Sounds."},{"author":"Dr Michael Mosley","text":"What I love about apples is they are so versatile. I've been snacking on them, grating them into my porridge, and having them sliced with full fat yoghurt as a dessert. But baked apples are one of my favourite ways to consume them. It seems an apple a day really does keep the doctor away, and also keep your heart, gut and even your waistline in good shape."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Dr Mosley eats apples in porridge,  sliced with yogurt, and even baked in the oven. He describes them as versatile \u2013 things which can be used for many different purposes, or in many different ways. What\u2019s more, cooking or baking apples doesn\u2019t damage those healthy flavonoids, so even the occasional apple crumble with custard can be good for you!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Apple crumble and custard! I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s a way to get in good shape \u2013 a phrase meaning \u2018healthy\u2019 or \u2018in good condition\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But, Neil, it seems the old proverb is true \u2013 according to the science, an apple a day really does keep the doctor away! Right, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked you about the strange sounding names given to some varieties of English apple."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I said that a \u2018Golden pippin\u2019 was the name of a real apple. So, was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes you were! Golden pippin apples were first grown in Arundel, near the south coast of England, while the other two - Black Worcester and Taylor\u2019s gold \u2013 are actually types of English pear. Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme, starting with proverb \u2013 a short sentence or expression giving some well-known, traditional advice."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you\u2019re feeling peckish , you\u2019re slightly hungry."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The adjective exotic describes something which is unusual and exciting, often because it comes from a faraway place."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The phrase trim the waistline means to keep your body weight healthy with no extra fat around your waistline \u2013 the area of your body above the hips."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Something which is versatile can be used for many purposes, or in many different ways."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And finally, if someone is in good shape , they\u2019re in a good state of health.
