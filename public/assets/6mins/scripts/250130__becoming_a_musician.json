I've been playing my guitar since I was 14."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Wow. Well, maybe one day you'll, you'll manage it. Who knows?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"What about you?"},{"author":"Pippa","text":"I don't think I'd like to be a musician. I think it would be a bit stressful. Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We\u2019ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we\u2019ll even listen to some of their music too."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"But first, I have a question for you, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Oh well, I think that's easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Well, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme."},{"author":"Bailey Tomkinson","text":"I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11."},{"author":"Neil","text":"This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home."},{"author":"Bailey Tomkinson","text":"I would go to these songwriters' circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I'd be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I'd sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they'd play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that's influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up."},{"author":"Neil","text":"When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters' circles . These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing . If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Let\u2019s meet another musician, Josh."},{"author":"Josh Robinson","text":"So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Josh lives in London and is a busker . This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities."},{"author":"Josh Robinson","text":"It's been kind of like my main earner that's kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it's then got me various different opportunities. It's got me all my gigs , it's got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking ."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Busking is Josh\u2019s main earner , it\u2019s his main source of money."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It\u2019s an informal, slang word."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Of course I would."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Well, here\u2019s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home."},{"author":"Clip from song","text":"Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there's something Or someone That side of the wall"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow.

The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Really? Well that's OK, I love 'the King' as well."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"OK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights , events where anyone can sing or play music."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Songwriters' circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A bunch of people is a group of people."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"Your main earner is your main source of income."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Gigs are musical concerts."},{"author":"Pippa","text":"And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website \u2013 bbclearningenglish.com.
