This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And I\u2019m Beth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many of those leading the fight against climate change are young people who feel betrayed by politicians and adults. In survey after survey, children report feeling that they have no future, that humanity is doomed, and that governments are failing to act."},{"author":"Beth","text":"This is causing many young people to feel worried about the state of the planet. There\u2019s even a name for it \u2013 climate anxiety . And it\u2019s also creating conflict between adults and children in families and schools."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What\u2019s certain is that a solution to the climate emergency needs the cooperation of everyone, both old and young. So, can talking honestly about the climate help mend the divisions between generations? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary."},{"author":"Beth","text":"But first I have a question for you, Neil.  Many young people\u2019s hopes and fears about climate change are symbolised by the Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg. These days Greta travels the world speaking about the climate emergency, but her protests started much smaller, in her hometown, Stockholm. So how did Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate activism begin? Did she:"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, I think Greta Thunberg went on strike and skipped school on Fridays."},{"author":"Beth","text":"OK, Neil, I\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.  One recent survey showed that three-quarters or more of young people in the UK feel the future is frightening. Here, Immie, aged 14, and Milly, 11, share some of their fears with BBC Ideas:"},{"author":"Immie","text":"If climate change were, like, an animal or plant, I think it'd be some sort of parasite, because it's the only thing that's actually growing and getting bigger, while everything else starts dying off. I think climate change is, like, really scary. And the fact that lots of people aren't doing much about it, just sort of freaks me out."},{"author":"Milly","text":"The environment is definitely very special because if we get rid of it, there's nowhere else we can go. It's a very one in a million , sort of, planet."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Immie calls climate change a parasite. In the natural world, a parasite is an animal or plant that lives on another living thing and feeds from it. If you describe a person as a parasite, you mean they are lazy and live off other people supporting them or giving them money."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Likewise, Immie thinks climate change is sucking the goodness out of the planet, and she uses a slang idiom to describe her feelings \u2013 it freaks me out! If something freaks you out , it makes you become very emotional, upset or confused."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Milly agrees. What freaks her out is that governments don\u2019t seem to be doing much about the problem. It\u2019s not as if we can escape anywhere \u2013 humankind only has one home, planet earth. Millie calls Earth one in a million , meaning very special or rare. So, what can be done? Psychotherapist, Caroline Hickman, has visited 10 countries around the world talking to over 100,000 teenagers about their climate fears. They told her about parents ignoring them when they wanted to discuss their feelings, and adults telling them, \u2018Fixing the planet is your job now!\u2019 Here, she gives BBC Ideas some advice on discussing climate change with children:"},{"author":"Caroline Hickman","text":"My advice to adults, parents, teachers, is do not put it off , don't push it away. Don't save it up and just have that big conversation. Talk about it regularly. That's crucial. And it's OK for you to say to your children, \"I don't have all the answers. We're not sure exactly how to deal with all of this. But let's find out together.\""},{"author":"Beth","text":"Caroline\u2019s top tip is to discuss the climate crisis regularly, to talk with children about their climate fears and not put it off \u2013 not delay talking about it until later."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Caroline also advises parents not to push it away , to choose to forget about or ignore the subject. A better response is to tell kids honestly, \u2018We don\u2019t have all the answers, but by sharing ideas we can work things out together\u2019 - a more hopeful message, and one that\u2019s shared by climate champion, Greta Thunberg."},{"author":"Beth","text":"Yes, and it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question \u2013 how did Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate activism begin, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I said it was by skipping school on Fridays\u2026"},{"author":"Beth","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! Greta started her \u2018school strike for climate\u2019 in August 2018 before it was taken up by over 1.6 million school children from 125 countries around the world. Okay, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with climate anxiety, feeling worried, afraid or depressed because of climate change."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A parasite is an animal or plant that feeds off another living thing."},{"author":"Beth","text":"If something makes you feel very emotional or upset, you might say, it freaks me out!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"The idiom one in a million describes something which is extremely special, rare or unlikely."},{"author":"Beth","text":"And finally, two phrasal verbs to finish with \u2013 to put something off which means to delay doing it \u2018til later, and to push something away which means to decide to forget about or ignore it. Once again our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Beth","Immie","Milly","Caroline
