This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Rob."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now, Georgina, you recently mentioned in one 6 Minute English programme about NFTs and that you had a collection of Pokemon cards when you were younger."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes \u2013 I did, and I still can\u2019t find them. Why did you bring that up?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, Pokemon started out as a video game series that turned into anime movies and trading cards among other things \u2013 and in this programme we\u2019re talking about a video game character that is iconic \u2013 a word which means widely known and recognised. That character\u2019s name is Super Mario."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Ahhh I spent many hours of my childhood playing with Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario or his rival, Sega\u2019s Sonic the Hedgehog."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now, these days, video games are everywhere, and people of all ages enjoy playing them. There\u2019s also competitive e-sports events where gamers compete for what are often considerable amounts of money."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, and there are also streamers that appear on platforms like Twitch and YouTube who have become celebrities in their own right."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Talking about celebrities, I have a question about the famous character we\u2019re talking about in this programme. Many people remember Super Mario Bros. as being the first time we saw Mario, but he first appeared in another game \u2013 which was it? Was it: a) The Legend of Zelda b) Donkey Kong; or c) Pokemon"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I\u2019m not sure about that \u2013 I can\u2019t remember him being in Pokemon, so I\u2019ll go for a) The Legend of Zelda."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. So, we established at the start of the programme that these days the video games industry is thriving."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"True \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t always that way. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, but in the 1980s the console market was struggling, particularly in the US."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Keza MacDonalds, video games editor for the Guardian newspaper, explains what was happening in the early 1980s. Here she is on BBC World Service programme You and Yours, speaking with Peter White."},{"author":"Keza MacDonald","text":"Well, back then, especially in America, there had been a flood of games that were just not very high quality. One of the games that\u2019s often cited as a factor in the collapse was this game called ET on the Atari, which was so bad they ended up burying thousands of copies of it in the desert, because nobody liked it."},{"author":"boom","text":"And, so we\u2019d had that, especially in America, this didn't happen so much in Europe, but in America just been lots and lots of software. None of it was all that great. There hadn't been anything really revolutionary in some years, so the video game  was really falling off a cliff and Nintendo is what rescued in the US especially."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Keza MacDonald used the term a flood of \u2013 meaning a large number in a short period of time \u2013 to describe the number of games that were coming out."},{"author":"Rob","text":"She used cited , which means referenced or noted, when talking about the game ET being a reference for a factor in the collapse of the console market."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And she said boom \u2013 a sudden period of growth. So as ET was mentioned as a factor in the collapse, many people say that Super Mario Bros. was the reason that video games really took off, especially in the US."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s interesting to consider what might have been if his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, had never created that character. The question is, why is that game so popular, what made it so fun to play?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here is Keza Macdonald speaking again with Peter White, on BBC World Service programme, You and Yours, explaining why Mario is just so popular and what makes the original game so satisfying to play."},{"author":"Keza MacDonald","text":"It\u2019s just such a joy to play. It's running and jumping, and it's the joy of movement. When, when you play, even the original Super Mario Bros, you just feel this sense of joy in your movement, and it's one of the greatest games ever made. And a lot of games from 35 years ago are basically unplayable now. They might have been a step to something greater, but Mario was one of those few that really holds up today as it did then."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Keza Macdonald said that some games from 35 years ago are unplayable \u2013 so, not possible to play them."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"But she said that Mario holds up \u2013 a term used to say that something\u2019s standards or quality has not lessened."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It certainly does hold up \u2013 in fact, I played it the other day and I had lots of fun with it \u2013 it reminded me of my childhood, and it\u2019s still as good now as it was then."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Which reminds me of your quiz question, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, in my quiz question I asked Georgina which game had the first appearance of that famous plumber, Mario."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I went for a) The Legend of Zelda."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which is wrong, I\u2019m afraid! Mario\u2019s first appearance was in Donkey Kong, and his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, never thought he would be that popular."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, I guess we\u2019ve all really learnt something today. Let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from today\u2019s programme about Super Mario, starting with iconic \u2013 famously associated with something and instantly recognisable."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Then we had a flood of which means a large amount of something in a short space of time."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Cited means reference as or noted."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Boom relates to explosion and means a short period of sudden growth."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Unplayable describes something that can\u2019t be played or a game that is very difficult to enjoy."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally, holds up means that the quality or standards of something hasn\u2019t changed and still looks good or plays well."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Bye for now!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Rob","Georgina","Keza
