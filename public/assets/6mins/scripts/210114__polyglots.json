And then.. Japanese? And\u2026 Spanish? Is that right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"\u00a1Si, muy bien!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"The English are famously slow to learn other languages. But it seems that Rob and I - and of course you - our global audience here at 6 Minute English - are good examples of polyglots \u2013 people who speak more than one language, sometimes known as 'superlinguists'. People who speak multiple languages benefit from many advantages, as we\u2019ll be hearing in this programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"That word polyglot sounds familiar, Neil. Doesn\u2019t the prefix \u2013 poly \u2013 mean, \u2018many\u2019?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right, like polygon \u2013 a shape with many sides."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Or polymath \u2013 someone who knows many things."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And speaking of knowing things, it\u2019s time for my quiz question. The word polyglot comes from Greek and is made up of two parts: poly, which as Rob says, means \u2018many\u2019, and \u2018glot\u2019. But what does \u2018glot\u2019 mean? What is the meaning of the word polyglot ? Is it: a) many words?, b) many sounds? or c) many tongues?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, there\u2019s three syllables in \u2018polyglot\u2019, Neil, so I reckon it\u2019s b), many sounds."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Rob, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. But leaving aside the origins of the word, what exactly does being a polyglot involve? British-born polyglot, Richard Simcot speaks eleven languages. Listen to his definition as he speaks to BBC World Service programme, The Documentary:"},{"author":"Richard Simcot","text":"A polyglot for me can be anyone who identifies with that term \u2013 it\u2019s somebody who learns languages that they don\u2019t necessarily need for their lives, but just out of sheer enjoyment, pleasure or fascination with another language or culture."},{"author":"Rob","text":"For Richard, being a polyglot simply means identifying with the idea - feeling that you are similar or closely connected to it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He says polyglots learn languages not because they have to, but for the sheer enjoyment, which means, \u2018nothing except\u2019 enjoyment. Richard uses the word sheer to emphasise how strong and pure this enjoyment is."},{"author":"Rob","text":"As well as the pleasure of speaking other languages, polyglots are also better at communicating with others. My favourite quote by South Africa\u2019s first black president, Nelson Mandela, is: \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.\""},{"author":"Neil","text":"How inspiring, Rob \u2013 I\u2019m lost for words! Here\u2019s another: \u2018To have another language is to possess a second soul\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So language learning is good for the head, heart and soul \u2013 a person\u2019s spirit or the part of them which is believed to continue existing after death."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 and what\u2019s more, language learning is good for the brain too. That\u2019s according to Harvard neuroscientist, Eve Fedorenko.She\u2019s researched the effects of speaking multiple languages on the brains of growing children."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Eve predicted that multilingual children would have hyperactive language brains. But what she actually found surprised her, as she explains here to BBC World Service\u2019s The Documentary:"},{"author":"Eve Fedorenko","text":"What we found \u2013 this is now people who already have proficiency in multiple languages - what we found is that their language regions appear to be smaller, and that was surprising\u2026  and as people get better and better, more automatic at performing the task, the activations shrink, so to speak, over time, it becomes so that you don\u2019t have to use as much brain tissue to do the task as well, so you become more efficient."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Eve was testing children who already have language proficiency \u2013 the skill and ability to do something, such as speak a language."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Her surprising discovery was that the language regions of these children\u2019s brains were shrinking \u2013 not because their speaking skills were getting worse, but the opposite; as they learned and repeated language patterns, their brain tissue became more efficient \u2013 worked quicker and more effectively."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s suggested that this increased efficiency is a result of exposure to different languages."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So that proves it, Neil: speaking many languages is good for the head, heart, mind and soul!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You took the words right out of my mouth!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"And speaking of words, what does the \u2018glot\u2019 in polyglot actually mean? Was my answer correct?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, that\u2019s right. In my quiz question I asked you for the meaning of the word \u2018polyglot\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"I said, b) many sounds."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But in fact the correct answer was c) many tongues. You may be a polyglot, Rob, but you\u2019re not quite a polymath yet!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK, well, let me get my brain tissues working by recapping the vocabulary, starting with polyglot \u2013 someone who speaks many languages."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The language centres in a polyglot\u2019s brain are efficient \u2013 theywork quickly and effectively in an organised way."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Proficiency means the skill and ability to do something well. And if you identify with something, you feel you are similar or closely connected to it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Polyglots learn languages for the sheer enjoyment of it \u2013 a word meaning \u2018nothing except\u2018 which is used to emphasise the strength of feeling."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So speaking many languages is good for mind and soul \u2013 a person\u2019s non-physical spirit which some believe to continue after death."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s it for this programme, but to discover more about language learning, including some useful practical tips, check out
