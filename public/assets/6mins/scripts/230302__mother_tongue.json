After several years travelling through Europe, they arrived in Canada as political refugees with no English. We\u2019ll be hearing about Julie\u2019s childhood when learning English started to replace her native language, Czech, and, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But first, I have a question, Rob. Julie\u2019s family left their home as political refugees, but every year millions of people are also displaced because of war, persecution, or the damaging effects of climate change. So, according to the United Nations, how many people around the world are currently living as displaced refugees? Is it:"},{"author":"Rob","text":"I\u2019ll guess it\u2019s 103 million."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme, Rob. Like many child refugees, Julie spoke only her mother tongue, Czech, at home with her brothers, sisters and parents who, in the beginning, spoke no English at all. Here she describes to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth, going to an English-speaking school for the first time."},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"\u2026so, you went into school not, to start off, with really understanding what was going on, is that right?"},{"author":"Julie Sedivy","text":"That's right. I just kind of interpreted things as best I could, and my memory of that is that that was not particularly difficult or traumatic. I think by then I'd had the experience of being dunked into various unfamiliar languages numerous times, and I had faith that it would sort itself out, and that everything would be just fine; and it was of course\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"At school, Julie was dunked into unfamiliar situations, a bit like a biscuit being dunked into a cup of tea. Often, dunk means to dip something into liquid, but here, the meaning is that Julie was suddenly dropped into a new situation for a while, then taken out, as her family travelled through Europe."},{"author":"Sam","text":"By the time she arrived in Canada, Julie had been exposed to several other languages including Italian and French. She had experienced many difficulties, but never given up hope of finding a new home. Julie had faith \u2013 in other words, trust or confidence, that everything would sort itself out , a phrase meaning to stop being a problem automatically, without having to do anything."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Over the following years, Julie faced many challenges: going to school and making friends; helping her parents as they struggled in the English-speaking world; and grieving for her native language which she slowly forgot, and with it, the chance to speak Czech with her dad before he passed away. Julie shares her thoughts on losing and refinding her mother tongue in her book, Memory Speaks."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Through it all, Julie kept alive her belief that by speaking two, three or even more languages, we don\u2019t forget who we are, but instead gain a sense of tolerance, an idea which she talked about with BBC Radio 4\u2019s, Word of Mouth."},{"author":"Julie Sedivy","text":"The idea that you can be both of Mexican ancestry, for example, and speak Spanish, and be a full-fledged American, or in my case come from a country like the Czech Republic, continue to speak my language and to be a Canadian and very proudly so and very invested in Canada as a society. There's a number of studies that suggest that the very presence of people with blended ideas in a society seem to lead to greater acceptance between groups. It creates the sense that this is not an either-or, that we can coexist, perhaps precisely because we have evidence that these cultures can coexist within a single person."},{"author":"Rob","text":"For Julie, there\u2019s no contradiction in being a Canadian refugee speaking Czech, or a Spanish-speaking immigrant who\u2019s a full-fledged \u2013 or fully developed \u2013 American. These are not either-or situations \u2013 cases where there is only a choice between two options, with no third possibility. Instead, a peaceful coexistence can develop, as shown in the life of Julie Sedivy herself."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Right. it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question: how many people around the world, like Julie, are living as displaced refugees?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, I said it was 103 million. Was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"And that was the correct answer, Rob, a number which, according to UN, is only going to grow. Now it\u2019s time to recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about losing our mother tongue \u2013 the native language you were brought up speaking by your parents."},{"author":"Rob","text":"If something is dunked , it\u2019s dipped into a liquid, like a biscuit in a cup of tea, but if someone is dunked into a situation, they\u2019re suddenly placed into a new and unfamiliar setting before being removed again after a short time."},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you have faith in something or someone, you have trust or confidence in them."},{"author":"Rob","text":"The phrasal verb to sort itself out , means to stop being a problem without having to do anything."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The adjective full-fledged means completely developed."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally, an either-or is a situation where only a choice between two options is possible, with no third alternative."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And that brings us to the end of this programme.
