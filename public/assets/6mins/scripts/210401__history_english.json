M\u00e9 l\u00edcap p\u00e9 t\u00f3 m\u00e9tanne!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I beg your pardon, Neil? Is something stuck in your throat?! Are you speaking a foreign language?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ha! Well, actually Georgina, I was saying, \u2018Good morning, pleased to meet you\u2019 in English - but not the English you and I speak. That was Anglo-Saxon, or Old English, the earliest form of English, spoken in the Middle Ages \u2013 so, between the 5th and 15th century."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"It doesn\u2019t sound anything like the way people talk nowadays."},{"author":"Neil","text":"No, but it\u2019s surprising how many of the words we use today have survived from Old English \u2013 beer, wine, drink, fish, bread, butter, eye, ear, mouth, head, hand, foot, life, love, laughter, mother, daughter, sister, brother, son, father \u2013 all Anglo-Saxon words!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Wow, so many everyday words! But what about the classics - Latin and Greek? I thought a lot of English vocabulary came from there."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s also true, but the history of English is the history of invasions \u2013 you know, when the army of one country fights to enter and control another country."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Like the Roman invasion of Britain?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, and later invasions too, by Norse-speaking Vikings and Germanic Saxons. In fact, Georgina, that reminds me of my quiz question."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Go on then, but in modern English if you don\u2019t mind\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. Well, the year 1066 is remembered for a famous battle when the French-speaking Norman king, William the Conqueror, invaded England \u2013 but what is the name of the famous battle? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Hmm, my history\u2019s not great, Neil, but I think it\u2019s, b) The Battle of Hastings."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out \u2018later\u2019 - another Old English word there! But it\u2019s not just words that survive from Anglo-Saxon, it\u2019s word endings too \u2013 the suffix , or letters added to the end of a word to modify its meaning."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Right, like adding \u2018s\u2019 to make something plural, as in: one bird, two birds. Or the \u2018ness\u2019 in \u2018goodness\u2019 and \u2018happiness\u2019. And \u2018dom\u2019, as in, \u2018freedom\u2019 and kingdom\u2019."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Poet Michael Rosen is fascinated by Old English. Here he is talking about word suffixes to Oxford University professor Andy Orchard for BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme, Word of Mouth."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Listen out for the proportion of modern English that comes from Anglo-Saxon."},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"\u2018I walked\u2019 \u2013 that \u2018walked\u2019 the \u2018et\u2019 bit on the end."},{"author":"Professor Andy Orchard","text":"Yeah, the \u2018ed\u2019 ending. Most modern verbs \u2013 if we were to say, \u2018I texted my daughter\u2019, I mean text obviously comes from Latin\u2026 \u2018I tweeted\u2019 \u2013 we still lapse to the Anglo-Saxon."},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"And, generally when I\u2019m speaking, just let\u2019s do it in mathematical terms, what proportion can we say is Old English? Can we say, like, about 80% in common parlance , sorry to use a French word there?"},{"author":"Professor Andy Orchard","text":"In speech it would be something like that \u2013 in the written language, less. They\u2019re the basic building blocks of who we are and what we think."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Professor Orchard estimates that 80 percent of spoken English in common parlance comes from Anglo-Saxon. In common parlance means the words and vocabulary that most people use in ordinary, everyday conversation."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"So Anglo-Saxon words are the building blocks of English - the basic parts that are put together to make something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"He also thinks that the languages we speak shape the way we see the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Here\u2019s Michael Rosen and Professor Andy Orchard discussing this idea on BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:"},{"author":"Michael Rosen","text":"Can we say that English speakers today, as I\u2019m speaking to you now, view the world through Anglo-Saxon eyes , through Anglo-Saxon words? Can we say that?"},{"author":"Professor Andy Orchard","text":"Well, in Old English poetry it\u2019s always raining and I suppose it\u2019s always raining today. There is a retrospective element, that we\u2019re still inhabiting that worldview, those ideas; the same words, the same simple ideas that they inhabited. And what\u2019s extraordinary if you think about the history of English is despite the invasions by the Norse and by the Norman, and then despite the years of empire when we\u2019re bringing things back, the English that we\u2019re speaking today is still at its root Old English word, at its heart Old English word, still very much English."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Michael Rosen asks if English speakers see the world through Anglo-Saxon eyes . When we see something through someone\u2019s eyes , we see it from their perspective, their point of view."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And Professor Orchard replies by saying that despite all the history of invasion and empire, the English we speak today is still Old English at heart \u2013 a phrase used to say what something is really like."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wow! So much history crammed into six minutes! And now, time for one more history fact."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Do you mean your quiz question, Neil? What\u2019s the name of the famous battle of 1066?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"What did you say, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said b) The Battle of Hastings."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the correct answer! The Battle of Hastings in 1066 played a big part in the Norman Conquest and mixing French words into the language."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I also know how the English ruler, King Harold, died \u2013 shot through the eye with an arrow!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ouch! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary, some of which exists because of invasions \u2013 when one country enters and controls another."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"A suffix is added to the end of a word to make a new word."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The phrase in common parlance means using ordinary, everyday words."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Building blocks are the basic parts used to make something."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To see things through someone\u2019s eyes means, from their point of view."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And finally, at heart is used to say what something is really like."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s all for this programme.
