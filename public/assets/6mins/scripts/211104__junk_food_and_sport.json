Did you watch them, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, I saw British swimmer, Adam Peaty, win a gold medal and - my personal favourite - 13-year-old, Sky Brown, competing in an exciting sport which was added to the Olympics this year: skateboarding."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Olympic athletes inspire people around the world to take on new challenges, eat healthily and get fit. So it seems strange that some of the companies that sponsor \u2013 or pay for, the Olympic Games also sell food and drink which is linked to obesity, heart disease and diabetes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Tobacco advertising was banned from international sport in 2005 because of the harmful effects of smoking. But other companies selling less-than-healthy products still sponsor big sporting events."},{"author":"Neil","text":"These could be sugary drink companies, or others who sell fast food \u2013 hot food, like hamburgers, that is quick to cook and serve but which is often unhealthy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In this programme we\u2019ll be asking whether it\u2019s right for companies selling unhealthy products to sponsor sporting events."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But first it\u2019s time for my quiz question, Sam. McDonalds had a long history with the Olympic Games until the company ended the partnership ahead of the 2024 games in Paris. But why did McDonalds choose to quit?

He worked for the World Health Organisation specialising in obesity before starting his own public health agency in Australia."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Here is Dr Demaio speaking with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, about the problem with unhealthy brands and food products:"},{"author":"Dr Sandro Demaio","text":"By having their brand alongside a young person\u2019s favourite sporting hero, on the chest of their national team, it does two things. First of all, it creates brand attachment , so if you\u2019re a young child you built the connection in your mind that basically fast food equals success. At the same time it also gives a health halo to that brand. Then you start to think in your mind, even subconsciously, that it can\u2019t be that bad\u2026"},{"author":"Sam","text":"You\u2019ve probably heard of \u2018brand loyalty\u2019, where people have a favourite brand they always buy, but Dr Demaio is concerned about brand attachment ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Brand attachment is the emotional connection between humans and brands. It goes deeper than loyalty so that people mentally connect a particular company with feelings of winning, being healthy and success."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The problem comes when these feelings attach to companies that aren\u2019t healthy at all. Dr Demaio says this creates a health halo \u2013 the belief that something is good, like an angel\u2019s halo, even though there is little evidence to support this."},{"author":"Neil","text":"On the other hand, fast food and fizzy drink companies invest large amounts of money in sport, over 4.5 billion dollars since the 2016 Rio Olympics, much of it supporting athletes around the world."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, with travel, training and equipment the cost of being an Olympic athlete can be huge. And depending on your country and your sport, there may be little financial help."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many athletes are desperate for any sponsorship they can get - but does that make it right to promote unhealthy eating in return?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Not according to Dr Demaio, who thinks people should worry about the nutritional value of fast food, as he explained to BBC World Service\u2019s, The Food Chain:"},{"author":"Dr Sandro Demaio","text":"When we think about foods and beverages of public health concern, we tend to start by talking about highly-processed foods, particularly ultra-processed foods. These are foods that have been really broken down to their basic elements and then built up \u2013 they\u2019re more products really than foods \u2013 they\u2019re made in a laboratory not a kitchen."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Demaio mentions unhealthy foods and beverages \u2013 another word for drinks."},{"author":"Sam","text":"He\u2019s concerned about the public health risk of ultra-processed food \u2013 foods containing extra ingredients like chemicals, colourings and sweeteners that you wouldn\u2019t add when cooking homemade food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A potato, for example, is natural - minimally processed. Bake a potato and it becomes \u2018processed\u2019. Make French fries and it\u2019s \u2018ultra-processed\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And speaking of French fries, Neil, what was the answer to your quiz question?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, I asked Sam the reason behind the decision McDonald\u2019s made not to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said it was, a) because they wanted to call French fries, McFries."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which was\u2026 the wrong answer! In fact, McDonald\u2019s wanted to be only company allowed to advertise cheese so it could boost cheeseburger sales."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This didn\u2019t go down well with officials in France, a country with over a thousand different types of cheese! OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with fast food \u2013 hot food that is quick to cook but may be unhealthy."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Companies that sponsor sports events, pay for them to happen."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Brand attachment is a psychological connection between someone and a brand."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A health halo is the perception that something is healthy for you, even if it\u2019s not."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ultra-processed foods are foods containing added artificial ingredients like colourings and preservatives."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And a beverage is another word for a drink."},{"author":"Sam","text":"That\u2019s all from us, but if you\u2019d like to find out more about the business, science and culture of food, why not download The Food Chain podcast! \u2013 it\u2019s updated weekly and available now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Join us again soon for more topical discussion and vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.
