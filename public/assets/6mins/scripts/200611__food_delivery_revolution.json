Maybe a pizza?  Fish and chips? Indian curry?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmmm, takeaway food to eat at home \u2013 that\u2019s a great idea. Yes, I\u2019ll have a pok\u00e9 bowl, please."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"What\u2019s that? It doesn\u2019t sound like typical takeaway food."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It is nowadays, Georgina! Over the last few years the explosion of food delivery apps like Deliveroo and Just Eat has seen a revolution in takeaway food. Today it\u2019s not just pizza and curries being delivered to people\u2019s front door \u2013 there\u2019s a wide range of food dishes and styles from all around the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And with caf\u00e9s and pubs closed during lockdown, more and more food chains and restaurants are switching to delivery-only services \u2013 takeaways \u2013 to bring meals to people who are isolating."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Over the last few weeks many takeaway companies have seen orders increase dramatically as people find themselves stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. But what are they choosing to eat? That\u2019s my quiz question for today, Georgina \u2013 last year what was Deliveroo\u2019s most ordered dish? Was it: a) Hawaiian Pok\u00e9 bowls? b) Cheeseburgers? c) Chicken burritos?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I would have thought it was \u2018fish and chips\u2019, but I\u2019ll go with b) Cheeseburgers."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, we\u2019ll find out later if you were right. One consequence of the increasing popularity of takeaways is something called \u2018dark kitchens\u2019. Unlike apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat which connect customers to local takeaways, these digital \u2018dark kitchens\u2019 work as just-for-delivery restaurants. Inside, chefs cook in kitchens without waiters, tables or diners, preparing high-quality dishes ready for delivery straight to your home."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"One of the first \u2018dark kitchen\u2019 operations, Taster, was started by chef Anton Soulier who in 2013 was working for Deliveroo when it was just a tiny company operating only in London. Now he\u2019s in charge of twelve kitchens catering for customers in London, Paris and Madrid."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sheila Dillon of BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme went to the Bethnal Green area of east London find out more."},{"author":"Sheila Dillon","text":"When you go on the Taster website the restaurant names are virtual , all of them sold as \u2018designed for delivery\u2019 by Taster. What that means is all the menus, drawn up by serious chefs are designed to travel well , chosen so they\u2019ll be warm, retain their texture and won\u2019t look like a dog\u2019s dinner when they come off the back of a bike. So strangely the delivery, the bike, has become a shaper of the foods we eat."},{"author":"Neil","text":"All the restaurants on Taster are virtual \u2013 existing online and created by computers to appear like the real thing."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Chefs cook the dishes using recipes and ingredients designed to travel well - be transported a long way without being damaged or their quality being spoiled."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s to avoid the takeaway food ending up like a dog\u2019s dinner - an informal way to say something that looks messy or has been very badly done."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Usually the takeaways are transported in a box on the back of a delivery cyclist who rushes them from the kitchen to the customer\u2019s home. It\u2019s a very modern way of eating, which Sheila thinks has become a shaper of the foods we eat \u2013 meaning that it has a strong influence on how a situation develops."},{"author":"Neil","text":"However some are worried that the increase in takeaways and delivery-only food means people are losing basic cooking skills. It\u2019s something that Taster boss Anton has noted too."},{"author":"Anton Soulier","text":"There is a strong underlying trend that maybe, in twenty, thirty years people won\u2019t have kitchens \u2013 and it\u2019s already happening in the US for example. I love cooking, it\u2019s one of my passions but I\u2019m rarely doing it - occasionally on Sundays and everything as it\u2019s almost going to become a weekend hobby ."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"People choosing to eat takeaways instead of cooking at home has become an underlying trend \u2013 a general development in how people behave which is real but not immediately obvious."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And in the future, cooking at home may even switch from being a daily necessity to a hobby \u2013 an activity someone does in their spare time for pleasure or relaxation."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I do enjoy tucking into a takeaway sometimes but personally I couldn\u2019t survive without my kitchen, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah, but could you survive without Deliveroo? Remember in today\u2019s quiz question I asked you what Deliveroo\u2019s most ordered dish was."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said b) Cheeseburgers."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But the correct answer was a) Hawaiian Pok\u00e9 bowls \u2013 a Hawaiian version of sushi."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Now that\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t cook at home!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Today we\u2019ve been discussing the revolution in takeaways and home-delivered food which in recent years has become an underlying trend - a general development in how people behave, or in this case, eat."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Another trend has been the creation of v irtual restaurants \u2013 online restaurants which look like the real thing but exist only on the internet."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Chefs create dishes using ingredients which travel well - can be transported a long way without being damaged or spoiled.
