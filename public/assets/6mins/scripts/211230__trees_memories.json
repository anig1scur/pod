This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve heard a lot about the human immune system \u2013 the cells in our bodies that fight diseases like coronavirus. We know that in humans the blood stream carries immune cells around our body."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But what about trees and plants? They don\u2019t have blood, so how do they protect themselves?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s a good question, Sam, and the answer involves memory. Us, humans, store memories in our brain, but our body also remembers things, including stressful situations from the past, which it stores in our genes. The information gets passed on to our children genetically."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But surely trees don\u2019t have memories, Neil! I mean, do you think a tree can remember being young or what it was doing last year?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, not exactly, but trees grow rings \u2013 a layer of wood for each year of growth. That could be a kind of memory."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In this programme, we\u2019ll be asking whether trees can remember \u2013 and if so, does it make them stronger and better able to fight disease?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before that I have a question for you, Sam. As I said, trees grow a new ring every year and by counting them we can estimate their age. One of Earth\u2019s longest living trees is The Great Bristlecone Pine, found on the west coast of America. But how long can these trees live? Is it: a) over 1,000 years? b) over 3,000 years? or c) over 5,000 years?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Wow, it\u2019d be a job to count the rings on those trees! I\u2019ll say b) over 3,000 years."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam, we\u2019ll reveal the correct answer later."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Unlike us, trees don\u2019t have blood and bones to protect them from outside attacks, so how exactly does a tree\u2019s immune system work?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s what BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience, asked bioscientist, Jurriaan Ton. Here\u2019s what he said:"},{"author":"Jurriaan Ton","text":"Plants in particular need to have a very efficient immune system for two important reasons. Firstly, they sit at the bottom of the food chain so there are a lot of opportunistic organisms out there, including insect herbivores and microbial pathogens who want to tap into that biochemical energy that is stored in plants. The other reason is plants are rooted to the ground \u2013 they cannot escape from the stressful conditions in their environment."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It\u2019s hard for trees to protect themselves. Unlike animals, they can\u2019t run away, and they\u2019re at the bottom of the food chain \u2013 the plants and animals linked in a chain of eating weaker things and then being eaten by stronger ones."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Rabbits eat grass and, in turn, are eaten by foxes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Right. If you are at the bottom of the food chain , everything wants to eat you, including opportunistic animals. If something is opportunistic , it takes advantage of a situation to gain some benefit for itself. Tree leaves are opportunities for hungry insects and caterpillars to eat."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, trees need immunity because they\u2019re under attack, either from disease or from living things wanting to eat them. But what about memory, Sam?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"If trees can remember stress - types of insects that eat it, for example \u2013 they might be better prepared in future."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For me, stress is a work deadline or moving house, but for trees it\u2019s more basic, something like not getting enough water."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Dr Estrella Luna-Diez believes trees record stress in their rings. A small ring, showing that the tree didn\u2019t grow much that year, indicates some outside stress. She explained more to BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience:"},{"author":"Estrella Luna-Diez","text":"Our hypothesis would be that, depending on the level of that stress \u2013 if it was a really long-lasting drought of a few years, then maybe the tree can remember it for a long time because it needs to adapt to that hostile environment. Now, maybe the hypothesis would be the other way around, maybe if it was a very dry July for instance, maybe the tree is not even that bothered and then it forgets within one year because that memory of stress is gonna be holding it back on its growth, for instance."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Dr Luna-Diez has a hypothesis \u2013 an idea that explains how or why something happens which has yet to be tested to see if it\u2019s correct."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Her hypothesis is that trees remember stressful outside events, something like a drought \u2013 a long period of time with little or no rain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For a tree which has lived for hundreds of years it might be useful to remember that 1947 was a very dry summer."},{"author":"Sam","text":"On the other hand, maybe that stressful year is best forgotten. Maybe the tree is not bothered \u2013 not worried or concerned because it\u2019s not important to it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, trees do have memories - but they don\u2019t let it get them stressed!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Maybe that\u2019s the secret to a long life! But what\u2019s the answer to your question, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, I asked you how long Earth\u2019s oldest trees, Great Bristlecone Pines, can live."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I said b) over 3,000 years. Was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were wrong, I\u2019m afraid, Sam. They live even longer \u2013 over 5,000 years, in fact \u2013 all the way back to the Bronze Age."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What memories those trees must have - if only they could speak! Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned, starting with immune system \u2013 the body\u2019s way of fighting infection and disease."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A food chain describes the ways plants and animals get eaten and eat each other."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Opportunistic people take advantage of a situation to get some benefit for themselves."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A hypothesis is an idea to explain how or why something happens that hasn\u2019t been tested to see if it\u2019s correct."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A drought is a long period of time with little or no rain."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, if you\u2019re not bothered about something , you\u2019re not worried because it\u2019s not important to you."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Our six minutes are over.
