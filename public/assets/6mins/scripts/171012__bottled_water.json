Refreshing in this context means making you feel cool again after being hot. So has that cooled you down, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Neil Yes, I feel very refreshed now, thanks."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Can I ask you though \u2013 why didn\u2019t you just get a glass of water from the kitchen tap? That water is cool and refreshing too \u2013 and it\u2019s free!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Neil Well, I like this brand of bottled water better \u2013 it\u2019s enriched with salts and minerals that are very beneficial to your health.

Honestly, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It tastes better, Rob."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yeah\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. For the first time in the UK, bottled water is more popular than cola. In fact, can you tell me how many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it\u2026 a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Right. Well, I\u2019m going to say 29 million litres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK. We\u2019ll find out later if you got that right or wrong. But seriously, Rob, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a good thing that people are choosing to buy bottled water at the supermarket rather than fizzy drinks?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Rob Yes, of course. But as I said to you earlier, why don\u2019t people just drink tap water? Let\u2019s listen to Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution \u2013 and of course, bottled water causes a huge amount of that. Here\u2019s Natalie now, talking about how drinks manufacturers have persuaded people that bottled water is better for them."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea They manufactured the demand for bottled water and they spent millions of pounds on adverts sort of scaring us off of tap water. The bottled water companies set out to make us believe that tap water wasn\u2019t healthy. And yet, tap water is way more regulated than bottled water is, and in taste tests, tap water comes up trumps most times."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you manufacture something you make it in large amounts in a factory. But here Natalie says the drinks companies \u2018manufactured the demand for bottled water\u2019\u2026"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Which means they made adverts to persuade people that tap water wasn\u2019t healthy \u2013 and bottled water was."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Hmm \u2013 To scare people off \u2013 What does that mean, Rob?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, if you scare somebody off you make them go away by frightening them. So some advertisers may have suggested, for example, that tap water was unsafe to drink \u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Whereas bottled water was safer, and tasted better too!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"You\u2019re catching on! However, Natalie Fee claims that tap water is more regulated than bottled water is."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Regulated means controlled. Natalie also says that in taste tests tap water comes up trumps. What does she mean by that?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well, a taste test is where you ask people to try several very similar products without knowing which one is which, and then you grade them according to which you like the best. And if something comes up trumps \u2013 it means it produces a good result, often unexpectedly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So tap water comes up trumps, eh?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yup. Perhaps you should try a taste test now, Neil? It would be interesting to see if your enriched bottled water comes up trumps of not!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I tell you what, let\u2019s leave that until later and hear the answer to today\u2019s quiz question instead."},{"author":"Rob","text":"OK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"I asked you: How many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016?

And I said 29 million litres."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And the answer is\u2026 2.9 billion litres."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Wow!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You can buy many different brands of bottled water with a range of price tags. At the top end, there\u2019s water from a 4,000 year-old Norwegian iceberg."},{"author":"Rob","text":"How much does that cost?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Around \u00a380 a bottle."},{"author":"Rob","text":"As cheap as that?
