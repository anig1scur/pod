I'm Sophie\u2026"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I'm Neil. Sophie \u2013 did you see the beautiful sky last night?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"No, I went to bed early. Why?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I was wondering if there was life out there."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"You mean life on other planets? That's just science fiction, Neil."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It isn't! People are fascinated by life on other planets for a good reason."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"You believe in little green men?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Not necessarily\u2026 but possibly."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well, Mars is our closest neighbour in the solar system and the subject of today's show. And that brings me on to our usual quiz question. How long is a day on Mars? Is it about\u2026 a) 5 hours? b) 25 hours? Or c) 45 hours?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I think it must be c) 45 hours. Things are weird on other planets. And Mars is further from the sun than us\u2026 Mars may be our closest neighbour, but it's hardly in our backyard, is it?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"It is in astronomical terms, Neil \u2013 it's visible to the naked eye \u2013 meaning without using instruments \u2013 and it's reachable by spacecraft. Well, we\u2019ll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now can you tell me Neil why people like you get excited about the possibility of life on Mars?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, Mars is similar to the Earth in some important ways which means if life developed on our planet, why not Mars?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"That's true. Its temperature is in the right zone \u2013 not too hot and not too cold. But actually we could find Mars pretty cold \u2013 an average temperature would be around minus 63 degrees Celsius compared to Earth's 14 degrees Celsius. It's also very arid \u2013 or dry."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And it needs to be wet for life to develop, doesn't it?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"That's right. Many scientists think that liquid water is essential for life! But there may have been water on the surface of Mars in the past. And recent research suggests that there may be water underground. Let's hear some more about this from Professor John Zarnecki, who teaches Space Science at The Open University."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University We are now seeing that in fact Mars probably does have water \u2013 not liquid water \u2013 that there is ice just below the surface and there's even just recently tantalizing evidence that perhaps water does flow periodically... Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans\u2026 So life is much, much tougher."},{"author":"Neil","text":"What does tantalizing mean, Sophie?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach. So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain. The other interesting point the professor makes is that life may exist in the very harsh Martian environment \u2013 because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"E xtremophiles are organisms \u2013 or small creatures \u2013 that live in very extreme environments and can survive conditions that would kill most other organisms. But on Mars they would be living underground because the radiation \u2013 or light and heat \u2013 from the Sun would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet. So why doesn\u2019t the Sun's radiation kill us then, Sophie?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"The Earth has a strong magnetic field created by its hot molten core \u2013 or centre \u2013 and this protects us from the Sun's harmful solar winds."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And what about Mars - why doesn't it have a magnetic field?"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"It used to \u2013 4 billion years ago. It\u2019s possible that a massive collision with an asteroid might have heated up Mars's core, disrupting the magnetic fields."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And if you disrupt a process you stop it from continuing normally. Now, to return to the subject of collisions, Sophie, I have something very interesting to tell you."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Yes?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"A meteorite \u2013 or a piece of rock from outer space \u2013 might've crashed into the Earth millions of years ago. That meteorite might have contained Martian life forms. So we might be descended from Martians!"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"That's actually an interesting idea, Neil. But let's listen to Professor John Zarnecki talking about interplanetary life."},{"author":"INSERT","text":"John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University If we do find traces of life on Mars we don't know, do we - whether it evolved independently or was it perhaps seeded from Earth. It is possible that life forms from Earth travelled to Mars and perhaps existed there \u2013 or the other way round."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So life on Mars may have evolved \u2013 or developed \u2013 on its own. Or it might have arrived from Earth in a lump of rock\u2026 Or the other way round! So Martians might be humans or we might be Martians! One big interplanetary happy family, Sophie!"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well Neil, let's hope you stay happy after you hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How long is a day on Mars? Is it \u2026 a) 5 hours? b) 25 hours? Or c) 45 hours?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said c) 45 hours \u2013 they must have a long day over there."},{"author":"Sophie","text":"And you were \u2026 wrong! The correct answer is b) because a day on Mars is slightly longer than here on Earth \u2013 it's 25 hours. Anyway, can we at least hear the words we learned today?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"They are: the naked eye arid tantalizing extremophiles organisms radiation core disrupt meteorite evolved"},{"author":"Sophie","text":"Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans\u2026 So life is much, much tougher."]},{"begin":"175.720","end":"177.800","lines":["What does tantalizing mean, Sophie?"]},{"begin":"177.800","end":"201.880","lines":["It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach.
