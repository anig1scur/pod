This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Phil."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"And I\u2019m Georgie."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Some people remember their school days as the best time of their lives. For others, it was the worst. Did you enjoy school, Georgie?"},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Most of the time, yes, but there was one thing I didn\u2019t like - the school rules!"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Luckily that\u2019s not a problem for pupils at the Bamboo School in Thailand because there, the children, not the teachers, make the rules! Children at the Bamboo School are responsible for every part of running the school, from buying food for the kitchens to disciplining fellow students and even hiring new staff. It\u2019s a school run by students, for students."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Yes. In this programme we\u2019ll be hearing about the Bamboo School, a unique school where the children call the shots \u2013 they have the power to make the decisions. We\u2019ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, and before you ask, Phil, - yes, the Bamboo School really is made of bamboo!"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Sounds good, Georgie. But first I have a question for you. The Bamboo School is a private school for poorer children who can\u2019t afford school fees. Bamboo School children get educated for free but have to do something in return. But what? Is it:"},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Hmm, I guess they have to learn English."},{"author":"Phil","text":"OK Georgie, I\u2019ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. The idea behind the Bamboo School is simple: teaching children responsibility by letting them run their own school. The school doesn\u2019t employ cooks, gardeners or cleaners \u2013 it\u2019s all done by the pupils."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Twice a week, children go to the vegetable market with a school officer and buy food for all 150 students. The prices are then carefully checked by other students like Nooneem, who manages the food accounts. Here is Nooneem speaking with William Kramer, reporter for BBC World Service programme, 'People Fixing the World':"},{"author":"Nooneem","text":"I am interested in accounting to begin with, so I get excited by it. When I actually get to do it, I enjoy it a lot since we are doing the actual job. With this hands-on experience we see the school\u2019s real spending and the things we purchased."},{"author":"William Kramer","text":"So, you went to a local school before, just in this area, what are the differences between that school and this school?"},{"author":"Nooneem","text":"My old school wasn't like this. It was just classes and then home. Here, I get to try so many things, gain real world experience, and work on my leadership skills with my friends. I never had these opportunities before and the school has been amazing!"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Nooneem says shopping at the market is a hands-on experience \u2013 she\u2019s actively involved in doing something practical, rather than getting someone else to do it."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"She enjoys managing the food accounts because it\u2019s real world experience. The phrase real world describes how the world works in reality, rather than someone\u2019s idea of it, which might be unrealistic. Children at the Bamboo School get opportunities to try something new and different outside the classroom, increasing the chances they\u2019ll find something they're really good at."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Of course, there are some adults \u2013 every school needs teachers. But what\u2019s special is how children are trusted, and respond positively to that trust. Here\u2019s reporter, William Kramer, again, speaking with Myra Anubi for BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World:"},{"author":"Myra Anubi","text":"So, just to be clear, it seems like the grown-ups are still in charge in the classrooms, but outside it's the kids who run stuff."},{"author":"William Kramer","text":"Yeah, I think that\u2019s broadly right, and I think one of the things that\u2019s interesting about this school is it manages to be quite conventional in some ways and really innovative, even radical, in others."},{"author":"Phil","text":"At the Bamboo School, the grown-ups - another word for adults - are still in charge in the classroom, but it\u2019s the kids, or children, who run everything. It\u2019s a radical idea and means that besides lessons, there\u2019s lots of work to be done. Children do two hours of community service , that\u2019s work that is done without pay to help people in a community, every week."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Anyway, I think it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to your question."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Yes, we just heard that kids go to the Bamboo School for free but do something in return. But what? Georgie guessed it was learning English, which was\u2026 the wrong answer, I\u2019m afraid. In fact, pupils at the school have to plant trees, 400 of them every year!"},{"author":"Georgie","text":"Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about a school where the kids , or children, call the shots , a phrase meaning have the power to make the important decisions."},{"author":"Phil","text":"Hands-on experience means being actively involved in doing something practical, rather than just talking about it, or getting someone else to do it."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"The phrase real world is used to describe how the world really is, rather than someone\u2019s idea of it which may be unrealistic or untypical."},{"author":"Phil","text":"A grown-up is an informal word for an adult, and a kid is an informal word for a child."},{"author":"Georgie","text":"And finally, community service is work that is done without pay to help people in a community. Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!"},{"author":"Phil","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Phil","Georgie","Nooneem","William Kramer","Myra
