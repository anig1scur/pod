The growth of things like crowdfunding have helped make entrepreneurship more accessible, led to tons of new start-ups.

It\u2019s not something that any one individual can do, it has to be a collective effort , but the more we have young, committed, smart people who want to make the world a better place working in government, the more likely government is to start delivering the kind of services we need in order to ensure a high quality of life in that country."},{"author":"Rob","text":"So, Charles mentions the problem that governments can be corrupt - act in morally wrong or illegal ways, often in return for money or power."},{"author":"Sam","text":"The talent and passion that millennials put into starting their own business could instead be used to improve governments through collective effort - a group of people acting together to achieve a common goal."},{"author":"Rob","text":"It\u2019s this working together than can raise people\u2019s quality of life \u2013 level of personal satisfaction and comfort."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Something that Muhammad Yunus was doing."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Ah yes, that\u2019s today\u2019s quiz question.
