I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And I\u2019m Georgina."},{"author":"Neil","text":"In this programme we\u2019re going to be talking about the astronaut who piloted the command module to take Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon. Michael Collins, who sadly passed away in 2021 at the age of 90, has been described as \u2018the loneliest man in history\u2019."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, while Armstrong delivered his famous quote when taking the first steps on the lunar surface, and Buzz followed soon after, Collins was left behind to circle the Moon, tasked with the huge responsibility of getting the three pioneers \u2013 the first people to do something - back to Earth."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s right \u2013 And many people over the years have wondered whether he was disappointed not to have walked on the Moon. How would you feel if you went all that way and didn\u2019t stand on the Moon, Georgina?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Me personally \u2013 I\u2019d probably be pretty devastated \u2013 but I think it depends on personality. To be honest, I\u2019d probably be too scared to go to the Moon anyway."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes \u2013 and just think about being in a space module together \u2013 trapped for all those hours \u2013 it could create quite the sense of camaraderie \u2013 a friendship and trust formed by spending time together."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Or you could drive each other crazy asking questions!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is what I\u2019m going to do now, Georgina. I know how much you love animals \u2013 and the first animal that went into space was a Russian dog in 1957, but what was that dog\u2019s name?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, I think I know this one - b) Laika - and I believe, sadly, she didn\u2019t survive."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Georgina, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. But let\u2019s talk more about Michael Collins and that famous trip to the Moon that captured people\u2019s attention around the world."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes - I think one thing that has always interested me is the feeling of friendship, or as you said camaraderie, that must have developed between those three explorers. But, perhaps surprisingly, in an interview with the BBC programme Hard Talk, Collins said the close connection between the astronauts didn\u2019t develop until later."},{"author":"Michael Collins, astronaut","text":"We formed some very strong bonds , but actually, not really during the flight of Apollo 11 or even during the preparatory flight of the flight. It was a round-the-world trip that we took after the flight. When I came to know Neil better. During our training, in the first place we had not been a backup as most primary crews had been, so we just got to know each other in the 6 months before the flight, which is a short period of time."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, it wasn\u2019t really until afterwards that they formed those strong bonds \u2013 the connections between them, until on a trip round the world to talk about their experiences."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Six months sounds like a long time, but I suppose when preparing to become famous and go down in history , as they did - it doesn\u2019t leave much time for personal interactions."},{"author":"Neil","text":"One of the sad things to take away is that everyone remembers Armstrong and Aldrin, but sometimes Collins is seen as the forgotten man."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes \u2013 and he did say in the interview that he would have loved to walk on the Moon, but he was very proud to be a part of the team \u2013 as he was one of the trailblazers \u2013 a similar word to pioneer."},{"author":"Neil","text":"They most certainly were trailblazers. But imagine how he must have felt \u2013 circling around Moon, all alone!"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes, a lot of people questioned Collins afterwards regarding the solitude , about which he had this to say in the same interview with BBC programme Hard Talk:"},{"author":"Michael Collins, astronaut","text":"Well, I\u2026 when I returned to Earth, I was amazed because most of the questions to me from the press centred on: You were the loneliest man in the whole lonely orbit around the lonely planet on a lonely evening. And I felt, on the other hand, quite comfortable in my happy little home inside the command module Columbia. I had been flying aeroplanes by myself for a number of years. So, the fact I was aloft by myself was not anything new."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, it sounds like he appreciated the peace and quiet and he felt used to it having been alone on flights."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Yes \u2013 while people talk about the two who walked on the Moon, he must have experienced an incredible sense of peace while on the dark side of the Moon \u2013 the first person ever to go there."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But now, Georgina, let\u2019s get the answer to my question: What was the name of the first animal, a dog, to go into space?"},{"author":"Georgina","text":"I said Laika."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Which is correct, well done! And you were right when you said that she sadly didn\u2019t survive the return to Earth."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Well, speaking of dogs, I need to feed mine soon - so let\u2019s just recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve discussed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, we had camaraderie \u2013 a sense of trust and friendship after spending a long time together, and the creation of strong bonds or connections."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And if you\u2019re the first person to do something, you could be called a pioneer ."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Or even a trailblazer which means the same thing. And if you are the first person to do something, you could become famous and go down in history."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"And finally we spoke about the solitude , or state of being alone, that Collins must have experienced."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, we\u2019re out of time for today. We have plenty more 6 Minute English programmes to enjoy on our website at bbclearningenglish.com."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"If you are busy, we offer English in a Minute: short videos with tips on how to improve your English."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And check us out on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."},{"author":"Georgina","text":"Don't forget we have an app too, which you can download for free from the app stores.
