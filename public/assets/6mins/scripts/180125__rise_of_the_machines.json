What\u2019s with the protective gear and helmet?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019m just getting ready for the inevitable rise of the machines. That\u2019s the takeover of the world by artificial intelligence, or AI, which some people predict will happen."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Inevitable means cannot be avoided or stopped. Rise of the machines? What do you mean?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It\u2019s our topic in this 6 Minute English. We\u2019ll be talking about that, giving you six related pieces of vocabulary and, of course, our regular quiz question."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That\u2019s the first thing you\u2019ve said that makes any sense. What\u2019s the question?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"The word \u2018robot\u2019 as we use it today was first used in a 1920\u2019s Czech play \u2018Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots\u2019. But before this, what was its original meaning? a) forced labour b) metal man c) heartless thing"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I will go for a) forced labour"},{"author":"Dan","text":"We\u2019ll find out if you were right or not later in the show. Neil OK Dan. Tell me what\u2019s going on."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I saw a news article written by BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones about the recent CES technology show in Las Vegas. He interviewed David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, who said it was his ambition to achieve an AI that can beat humans at any intellectual task."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Surely it\u2019s a good thing! Better AI and robotics could take over many of the jobs that we don\u2019t want to do, or that are so important to get 100% right\u2026 like air traffic control. We\u2019d never have another plane crash. It would be infallible because it would be so clever."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Infallible means never failing. And that\u2019s what bothers me. What happens when its intelligence surpasses ours? Why should it do what we want it to do?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"To surpass something is to do or be better than it. Dan, you\u2019ve been watching too many movies. Robots fighting humanity is a popular theme. Guess what\u2026 humanity often wins. And besides, we would programme the computer to be benevolent."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Benevolent means kind and helpful. But that\u2019s just it, once the intelligence becomes sentient, or able to think for itself, who knows what it will do. We humans are not exactly perfect, you know. What happens if it decides that it is better than us and wants us out of the way?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Don\u2019t worry. Asimov thought of that. Isaac Asimov was an American science fiction writer who, among other things, wrote about robots. He came up with three laws that every robot would have to follow to stop it from acting against humanity. So we\u2019re safe!"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019m not so sure. A sentient robot could make up its own mind about how to interpret the laws. For example, imagine if we created an AI system to protect all of humanity."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that\u2019s great! No more war. No more murder. No more fighting."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Do you really think that humans can stop fighting? What if the AI decides that the only way to stop us from hurting ourselves and each other is to control everything we do, so it takes over to protect us. Then we would lose our freedom to a thing that we created that is infallible and more intelligent than we are! That\u2019s the end, Neil!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I think that\u2019s a little far-fetched, which means difficult to believe. I\u2019m sure others don\u2019t think that way."},{"author":"Dan","text":"OK. Let\u2019s hear what the Learning English team say when I ask them if they are worried that AI and robots could take over the world."},{"author":"Insert","text":"Phil Well, it\u2019s possible, but unlikely. There will come a point where our technology will be limited \u2013 probably before real AI is achieved."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Never in a million years. First of all we\u2019d programme them so that they couldn\u2019t, and secondly we\u2019d beat them anyway. Haven\u2019t you ever seen a movie?"},{"author":"Kee","text":"I totally think it could happen. We only have to make a robot that\u2019s smart enough to start thinking for itself. After that, who knows what it might do."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A mixed bag of opinions there, Dan. It seems you aren\u2019t alone."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Nope. But I don\u2019t exactly have an army of support either. I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Speak for yourself. I\u2019ve waited long enough \u2013 for our quiz question that is."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh yeah! I asked you what the original meaning of the word \u2018robot\u2019 was before it was used in its modern form. a) forced labour b) metal man c) heartless thing"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said a) forced labour"},{"author":"Dan","text":"And you were\u2026 right! Neil Shall we take a look at the vocabulary then?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"OK. First we had inevitable. If something is inevitable then it cannot be avoided or stopped. Can you think of something inevitable, Neil?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"It is inevitable that one day the Sun will stop burning. Then we had infallible, which means never failing. Give us an example, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"The vaccine for small pox is infallible. The natural spread of that disease has been completely stopped. After that was surpasses. If something surpasses something else then it becomes better than it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Many parents across the world hope that their children will surpass them in wealth, status or achievement. After that we heard benevolent, which means kind and helpful. Name a person famous for being benevolent, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Father Christmas is a benevolent character. After that we heard sentient. If something is sentient, it is able to think for itself."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Indeed. Many people wonder about the possibility of sentient life on other planets. Finally we heard far-fetched, which means difficult to believe. Like that far-fetched story you told me the other day about being late because of a dragon, Dan."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I swear it was real! It had big sharp teeth and everything!"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that\u2019s the end of this 6 Minute English. Don\u2019t forget to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages. See you next
