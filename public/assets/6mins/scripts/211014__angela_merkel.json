It\u2019s a position like the prime minister in the UK."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And one of Germany\u2019s longest serving chancellors was Angela Merkel, who led the country from 2005 until the recent elections in September 2021."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, we\u2019re going to find out more about her soon but not before I\u2019ve challenged you to answer this question, Neil. Who was Germany\u2019s first ever chancellor ? Was it: a) Otto von Bismarck, b) Helmut Schmidt or c) Franz von Papen?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, my knowledge of German history isn\u2019t great but a) Otto von Bismarck, sounds most likely."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later on. But let\u2019s talk more about Angela Merkel now. She was in office for 16 years \u2013 \u2018in office\u2019 means \u2018in power\u2019 or \u2018in charge\u2019, until she stepped down last month."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, that\u2019s a long time \u2013 which meant that she had to make lots of decisions, popular with some people and not with others."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Over that time, she\u2019s gained a nickname \u2013 \u2018mutti\u2019 \u2013 German for \u2018mother\u2019. This could be seen as a compliment but started life as more of an insult, as BBC correspondent Damien McGuinness, explained on the BBC Radio programme, From Our Own Correspondent\u2026"},{"author":"Damien McGuinness, BBC correspondent","text":"The \u2018mummy Merkel\u2019 image in fact, started off as an insult from conservative rivals. It was made up during her first term in office by hardline conservatives in her predominantly male party. A patronising put down behind her back. Given her dry academic distinctly un-cuddly style, it was meant to be slighly ironic to put her in her place as a woman, possibly even meant to be hurtful, given that in reality she has no children."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Oh dear, so the nickname of \u2018mother\u2019 was really used as an insult to start with, probably invented by the men in her political party \u2013 described as the hardline conservatives \u2013 ones with traditional and strict beliefs that can\u2019t be changed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, the nickname was used as a put down \u2013 that\u2019s an insult, used to make someone feel stupid or embarrassed. And the intention was to make her feel less important \u2013 or to put her in her place ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, politics is full of insults and critics, but it sounds rather cruel, and Damien McGuinness does go on to say that this image is really a \u2018media myth\u2019 and not quite accurate."},{"author":"Neil","text":"The media has not always been negative about Angela Merkel. She is the longest serving amongst current EU leaders and participated in an estimated 100 EU summits. She has often been described as \"the only grown-up in the room\". So, the media has also labelled her \u2018The Queen of Europe\u2019."},{"author":"Sam","text":"What is true is that following the recent elections in Germany, her successor \u2013 the person who became chancellor - will lack the experience and gravitas that Merkel has gained over her 16 years as chancellor."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But Damien McGuinness, in his report for the BBC\u2019s From Our Own Correspondent programme, concludes that many people aren\u2019t sure which of her nicknames is accurate. What word does he use to mean \u2018phrases or ideas that have become meaningless because they\u2019ve been overused\u2019?"},{"author":"Damien McGuinness, BBC correspondent","text":"But the confusion around these cliches does point to another truth - The Chancellor is discreet, to the point of sometimes being invisible. So, there's a fascination about what's really going on behind that deadpan exterior. Angela Merkel may have been in power for more than a decade and a half, but people are still not really sure they know who she is."},{"author":"Sam","text":"He used the word cliches to mean \u2018phrases or ideas that have become meaningless because they\u2019ve been overused.\u2019 People are unsure which description of her is true because she is discreet \u2013 she keeps quiet about things so as not to attract attention."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, it\u2019s hard to know what she is thinking because she looks deadpan \u2013 that means she looks serious and doesn\u2019t show expression or emotion."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hmmm, I wonder if Germany\u2019s first ever chancellor had a deadpan exterior?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Ah yes, earlier you asked me who that was, and I said it was Otto von Bismarck. Was I right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, you were \u2013 well done."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Wunderbar! Now it\u2019s time to recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned today, starting with chancellor - the person in the highest position in a government in some countries."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Hardline describes someone with traditional and strict beliefs that can\u2019t be easily changed."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A put down is an insult, used to make someone feel stupid or embarrassed."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When someone is put in their place , they are made to feel less important than they are."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Cliches are phrases or ideas that have become meaningless because they\u2019ve been overused.
