That's what we'll be investigating in this episode, along with some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Beth Baby communication is a topic child psychotherapist Marie Derome writes about in her new book, What Your Baby Wants You to Know. So, what do newborn babies want us to know? Well, here's Marie's answer: Marie Derome I think they want us to know that they need us one hundred percent , because without us, they won't survive. Neil Without someone caring for them, babies wouldn't survive, so on a basic level every baby is saying, \"Take care of me!\" Marie says babies need us one hundred percent . She uses the phrase one hundred percent to emphasise that what she said is completely true. Beth And we'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Neil. Although they look small and helpless, babies are born with some amazing abilities. So, which of the following statements about newborn babies is true: a)    babies are born with a full set of teeth, b)    babies' eyes change colour, or c)    babies have the same number of bones as an adult? Neil Ooh, that's an interesting question. I think I know the answer, though. I'm going to go with b) babies' eyes change colour. Beth OK. Well, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme. Now, if you've spent time with a baby, you've probably noticed how much they move their little arms and legs. Here, Marie Derome explains the meaning of these movements to BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman's Hour. Marie Derome 75% of their movements are intentional , synchronised. They're not jerky \u2013 you know, to the naked eye they appear very jerky , but they're not. They're there to bring us in \u2013 the parents \u2013 you know, they need us\u2026 so all those movements are there to say, \"Look! Come! Look at me. I need you. I want to, you know, to play with you.\" Neil Babies move their arms and legs to create a bond with their parents. To the naked eye , these movements look jerky \u2013 an adjective meaning sudden and quick, not smooth-flowing. The phrase to the naked eye means in a way that can be seen without special instruments, like a microscope, or is seen in the way an ordinary person would. Beth In reality, these jerky movements are intentional , meaning that they are planned and done for a particular purpose \u2013 to catch their parents' attention so they will be noticed and cared for. Neil Marie's book is aimed at new parents who are learning to understand their baby's body language, but she also has advice for parents who are finding it difficult to bond with their newborn, as she explains here to BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman's Hour. Marie Derome Parenting is really hard. Falling in love with this little baby is not\u2026 you know, this idea of love at first sight \u2013 I think it's such an unhelpful clich\u00e9 . It will take time to love that baby, to get to know that baby\u2026 Beth Many new parents dream about falling in love with their baby at first sight . The idiom love at first sight means being in love with someone as soon as you see them for the first time. Neil But Marie thinks this ideal dream can cause problems. She calls it an unhelpful cliche . A cliche is an overused phrase or comment that has been said so much that it's become unoriginal and uninteresting, and in some cases unhelpful \u2013 for example by creating unrealistic expectations, or by making parents feel guilty they are not doing enough. Beth Marie says it takes time to get to know a newborn baby and to fall in love. But for most parents, all the misunderstandings, sleepless nights and dirty nappies are worth it for their amazing baby. Neil And speaking of amazing babies, what was the correct answer to your question, Beth? Beth Well, the correct statement was that babies' eyes change colour. I think you got that right, Neil. Neil I did! It's an amazing fact, but apparently true. Beth Yes, indeed. OK. So, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this episode, starting with the phrase one hundred percent , which can be used to emphasise that you completely agree with something, or that you consider something to be completely right or wrong. Neil If you describe a movement as jerky , you mean it moves suddenly in stops and starts, rather than flowing smoothly. Beth The adjective intentional means planned and purposeful. Neil The phrase to the naked eye means in a way that can be seen without special instruments, or to someone without special knowledge. Beth The idiom love at first sight describes the experience of starting to love someone as soon as you see them for the first time. Neil And finally, an unhelpful cliche is an overused phrase or comment \u2013 a clich\u00e9 \u2013 which has the effect of creating unhelpful or unrealistic attitudes. Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember you can find many more episodes, plus a quiz and worksheet for this one, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Goodbye for now!

That's what we'll be investigating in this episode, along with some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Beth Baby communication is a topic child psychotherapist Marie Derome writes about in her new book, What Your Baby Wants You to Know. So, what do newborn babies want us to know? Well, here's Marie's answer: Marie Derome I think they want us to know that they need us one hundred percent , because without us, they won't survive. Neil Without someone caring for them, babies wouldn't survive, so on a basic level every baby is saying, \"Take care of me!\" Marie says babies need us one hundred percent . She uses the phrase one hundred percent to emphasise that what she said is completely true. Beth And we'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Neil. Although they look small and helpless, babies are born with some amazing abilities. So, which of the following statements about newborn babies is true: a)    babies are born with a full set of teeth, b)    babies' eyes change colour, or c)    babies have the same number of bones as an adult? Neil Ooh, that's an interesting question. I think I know the answer, though. I'm going to go with b) babies' eyes change colour. Beth OK. Well, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme. Now, if you've spent time with a baby, you've probably noticed how much they move their little arms and legs. Here, Marie Derome explains the meaning of these movements to BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman's Hour. Marie Derome 75% of their movements are intentional , synchronised. They're not jerky \u2013 you know, to the naked eye they appear very jerky , but they're not. They're there to bring us in \u2013 the parents \u2013 you know, they need us\u2026 so all those movements are there to say, \"Look! Come! Look at me. I need you. I want to, you know, to play with you.\" Neil Babies move their arms and legs to create a bond with their parents. To the naked eye , these movements look jerky \u2013 an adjective meaning sudden and quick, not smooth-flowing. The phrase to the naked eye means in a way that can be seen without special instruments, like a microscope, or is seen in the way an ordinary person would. Beth In reality, these jerky movements are intentional , meaning that they are planned and done for a particular purpose \u2013 to catch their parents' attention so they will be noticed and cared for. Neil Marie's book is aimed at new parents who are learning to understand their baby's body language, but she also has advice for parents who are finding it difficult to bond with their newborn, as she explains here to BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman's Hour. Marie Derome Parenting is really hard. Falling in love with this little baby is not\u2026 you know, this idea of love at first sight \u2013 I think it's such an unhelpful clich\u00e9 . It will take time to love that baby, to get to know that baby\u2026 Beth Many new parents dream about falling in love with their baby at first sight . The idiom love at first sight means being in love with someone as soon as you see them for the first time. Neil But Marie thinks this ideal dream can cause problems. She calls it an unhelpful cliche .
