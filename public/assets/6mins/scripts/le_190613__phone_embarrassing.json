I'm Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I'm Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Sam, do you know Stephen Fry?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Not personally, but I know of him. Stephen Fry is an English writer and comedian and is well known for being extremely intelligent and very knowledgeable about many things cultural, historical and linguistic."},{"author":"Neil","text":"To be knowledgeable means 'to know a lot about something'. I wish I was half as knowledgeable as he is!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I wish I were a quarter as knowledgeable !"},{"author":"Neil","text":"There is still time, Sam! And maybe this week\u2019s question will help you become just a little bit more knowledgeable on the topic of the telephone. The first long distance telephone call was made in 1876. Approximately what was the distance of that call? Was it:"},{"author":"","text":"What do you think Sam? Sam So when you say long distance \u2026\u2026?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"For the time, yes. Remember the telephone was only a baby in 1876. Sam In that case, I\u2019ll say approximately 15km. But that\u2019s just a guess - a long distance guess."},{"author":"Neil","text":"We\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re right at the end of the programme. Stephen Fry is also known as a technophile . The suffix \u2018phile\u2019 means 'a lover of that thing'. So a technophile is someone who loves technology. Fry was a guest on the BBC podcast Word of Mouth and was talking about the technology of communication. It seems he\u2019s not a fan of the telephone. But why not?"},{"author":"Stephen Fry","text":"I think the telephone was a really annoying blip in our communications and that's old technology. I mean that's 1880s, 90s. When you're on the telephone to someone, especially if you're British \u2013 you know, that Bernard Shaw thing \u2013 oh, you know, the moment one Englishman opens his mouth another Englishman despises him - when you're speaking to someone on the telephone all the age, class , education, vocabulary all come into play because it's in real time and it's embarrassing. I hate being on the telephone to people - especially strangers in shops and things like that because it's embarrassing and awkward."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, why doesn\u2019t he like the telephone?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, he uses a quote from the writer George Bernard Shaw. It\u2019s not the exact quote but the meaning is that as soon as an English person speaks, another English person despises them. To despise someone is a very strong emotion and it means 'to really hate someone'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So, what is it about the English person\u2019s voice that leads others to despise them?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Stephen Fry goes on to explain that there is a lot of information about someone that people get from their voice. You can make a judgment about someone\u2019s age, level of education and class from the way that they speak and the vocabulary they use."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Class refers to your economic and social position in a society. In Britain, we talk about three classes: upper class, middle class and working class. The family into which you are born dictates your class . These used to be a lot more important in British society but there are still different prejudices and negative feelings related to the relationship between the classes ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Exactly, so hearing someone\u2019s voice on the telephone might make you think something negative about someone based on very old-fashioned ideas of class . What makes it worse is that these conversations happen in real time . This means they are 'happening live', 'not recorded', so you have no time to really think about it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So he may be a technophile , but he\u2019s not a fan of the phone!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Indeed. He called it a blip , which is a word for when something is not quite right - when there is a fault or a mistake which is usually not long lasting."},{"author":"Neil","text":"So do you think he\u2019s right?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, actually, I don\u2019t like to talk to strangers on the phone very much myself, but that\u2019s just me. But I do think that although the class divisions in British society are much less obvious and much less important than in the past, we still do make judgements about people based on how they speak and those judgements can often be completely false."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Right, nearly time to review our vocabulary, but first, let\u2019s have the answer to today\u2019s question. The first long distance telephone call was made in 1876. Approximately what was the distance of that call? Was it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"What did you think, ? Sam I guessed 15km. But it was just a guess."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, sadly, on this occasion it was not a correct guess. The correct answer is approximately 10km or 6 miles. Congratulations if you go that right. Now on with the vocabulary."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We started with the adjective knowledgeable , which means 'knowing a lot about something'."},{"author":"Neil","text":"A technophile is someone who loves technology."},{"author":"Sam","text":"To despise someone is to hate someone strongly."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Class refers to a group in society you are said to belong to from your birth. Certain stereotypes are often attached to different classes to do with intelligence and education, for example."},{"author":"Sam","text":"In real time is an expression that means 'happening live, without any pauses or breaks'. So for example, you aren\u2019t listening to this programme in real time ,"},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, I am."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Well, of course, you are Neil , because you are here with me as we are recording. But if you\u2019re listening to the podcast, it\u2019s no longer real time. It\u2019s been recorded and edited."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And we had one other word, didn\u2019t we?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, a blip , which is a temporary fault, or mistake."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Well, that's all we've got for this programme.
