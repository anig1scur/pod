This new system sounds like a good idea, Sam."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes \u2013 but as normal, we still have a question for you to answer first. I think we all agree we want to reduce our carbon footprint somehow \u2013 but according to the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions, how many tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually could be reduced by living car-free? Is it\u2026 a) Around 1 tonne, b) Around 2 tonnes, or c) Around 3 tonnes?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"I\u2019m sure living without a car would reduce CO2, so I\u2019ll say c) around 3 tonnes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"OK, Neil, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s right at the end of the programme. But let\u2019s talk more about carbon labelling. Listing the carbon dioxide emissions of a product on the packaging may encourage us to make greener choices."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s not a new idea but it\u2019s something that\u2019s never caught on \u2013  become popular or fashionable."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Until now. The idea now seems to have returned, and it\u2019s something the BBC World Service programme The Climate Question has been looking into. They\u2019ve been speaking to business leaders about adding labelling to their products."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Such as Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer at Unilever. Let\u2019s hear why he thinks the idea is growing in popularity\u2026"},{"author":"Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Unilever","text":"What we are seeing is Generation Z and Millennials, are much much more willing to make choices, informed choices , about responsible products and brands, so that's also why we're also doing it. At the end of the day, we're doing it because we believe that this is what consumers will ask from business - this is not something that we made up ourselves."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, in this case, it seems it\u2019s people buying Unilever products who are driving this change \u2013 particularly younger people from Gen Z. So people born towards the end of the 20th Century or the beginning of the 21st Century, or slightly older Millennials."},{"author":"Neil","text":"They want to make \u2018 informed choices\u2019 about what they buy \u2013 so, making decisions based on good and accurate information.  Carbon labelling is part of that information."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And Marc Engel mentioned consumers wanting to buy \u2018 responsible\u2019 products or brands. Here, that means \u2018trusted\u2019 or \u2018reliable\u2019 with less environmental impact."},{"author":"Neil","text":"That all makes sense, and it\u2019s why Unilever recently announced it\u2019s committed to putting carbon footprint information on 70,000 products. The Climate Question programme also spoke to Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke \u2013 an expert in supply chain management at Northumbria University.  What does she call measuring a product\u2019s carbon footprint?"},{"author":"Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke, Northumbria University","text":"The problem with footprinting is it's almost impossible to include the consumption stage associated with the consumer because we all deal with the products that we purchase and dispose of differently. So, it's very difficult to include that - so \u2018 farm-to-fork\u2019 calculations tend to really be \u2018farm-to-retail-shelf\u2019 calculations of carbon footprint loadings."},{"author":"Sam","text":"So, Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke describes the measurement of a product\u2019s carbon footprint as \u2018 foot printing\u2019 . And this, she says, is difficult to measure because we don\u2019t know what people do with the stuff after they have bought it."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Yes, so for example a carbon label might show an estimate of the carbon footprint of milk from the cow to the consumer \u2013 what Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke calls \u2018 farm to fork\u2019 \u2013 but after it leaves the supermarket shelf, we don\u2019t know how efficiently it is stored, how much is wasted and what happens to the packaging."},{"author":"Sam","text":"It\u2019s all food for thought \u2013 something to think seriously about."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And, Sam, what did you think about my answer to your question earlier?"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Ah yes, I asked you - according to the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions, how many tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually could be reduced by living car-free?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"And I said around 3 tonnes."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Which was actually, a bit too much. Research found living car-free reduces a person\u2019s annual CO2 production by an average of 2.04 tonnes."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Anyway, let\u2019s briefly recap some of the vocabulary we\u2019ve mentioned today."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, we\u2019ve been talking about measuring our carbon footprint - that\u2019s how much carbon is used through the activities of a person, company or country."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And footprinting is an informal way of saying measuring the carbon footprint of something."},{"author":"Sam","text":"When something has caught on it means it has become popular or fashionable. And, making informed choices means making decisions based on good and accurate information."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Buying something that is responsible means that it is trusted or reliable. And, the phrase from farm to fork describes the processes involved from agricultural production to consumption."},{"author":"Sam","text":"We\u2019re out of time now, but thanks for listening. Bye for now."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Goodbye."}],"authors":["Sam","Neil","Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Unilever","Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke, Northumbria
