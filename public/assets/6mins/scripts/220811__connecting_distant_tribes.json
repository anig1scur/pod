In tribal lands, located in remote, rural and rugged landscapes, internet connection is often very patchy, or non-existent.  In this episode, Sam and Neil discuss attempts to connect these remote areas. Join us to explore this topic and learn the useful vocabulary you need to talk about it!"],"this_week_question":["What was the name of the first ever internet browser, the engine for searching websites?

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I\u2019m Neil."},{"author":"Sam","text":"And I\u2019m Sam."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If you\u2019re old enough to remember the early days of dial-up internet then you\u2019ll know the unforgettable sound of the \u2018handshake\u2019, the clicks and squeaks your computer made as it struggled to connect to the internet through the telephone line."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes, I remember that strange noise! Dial-up internet was slow and websites took forever to load. And because you couldn\u2019t use both the internet and the telephone at the same time, this was usually followed by someone shouting, \u201cGet off the computer, I\u2019m making a phone call!\u201d"},{"author":"Neil","text":"In the thirty years since then, the internet has changed dramatically. Fibre optics and broadband have created superfast internet speeds and an interconnected online world, where physical distances between people are no longer a barrier to communication -  a situation expressed in the phrase, the global village ."},{"author":"Sam","text":"But take a closer look and you\u2019ll still find people around the world with a slow connection or no internet at all. In this programme we\u2019ll be finding out how some communities are working together to fix their internet connection problems for the benefit of local people. And, of course, we\u2019ll be learning some new vocabulary too."},{"author":"Neil","text":"But before that I have a question for you, Sam. We\u2019ve been talking about the early days of the internet, but do you know the name of the first ever internet browser, the engine for searching websites?  Was it:"},{"author":"Sam","text":"I\u2019ll guess it was c) Yahoo."},{"author":"Neil","text":"OK, Sam. We\u2019ll find out the answer later. You might think its people living in the most remote and isolated places with the greatest difficulty getting online, but that\u2019s not always true. Even here in the UK people struggle to connect, including BBC radio listener, Katie, who explained her problem to BBC World Service programme, Digital Planet:"},{"author":"World Service listener, Katie","text":"Hi, I\u2019m Katie. I live in Dorset in England. Our internet can be quite spasmodic here, and I think that that\u2019s due to most of our underground cabling is very old and somewhat dodgy , tatty, and needs replacing."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Katie lives in Dorset, a rural part of south-west England. She describes  her internet connection as spasmodic \u2013 suddenly working but only  for a short time and not in a regular way."},{"author":"Neil","text":"She thinks this is because her internet cables are dodgy , slang for bad or untrustworthy."},{"author":"Sam","text":"A dodgy internet connection might be irritating, but in other parts of the world the consequences can be more serious. Aamer Hayat is farmer who lives in the Pakistani Punjab, one of the country\u2019s most fertile regions, but also one of the least connected. His village is a three-hour drive from the nearest town, and he can\u2019t make a phone call, even with 2G."},{"author":"Neil","text":"For Aamer, basic weather information like knowing when rain is coming can mean the difference between his crops succeeding or failing. Without the internet he doesn\u2019t have a reliable weather report,  so the villagers decided to build their own fifty-metre-high telephone transmission tower, linking a network of five villages to the internet. Here is Aamer talking to BBC World Service programme, Digital Planet\u2026"},{"author":"Aamer Hayat","text":"We used to do conventional farming like just getting information from word-of-mouth. Now, I\u2019m using the latest technologies to have gadgets available with us and taking information right from the horse\u2019s mouth through internet and the technology we have in our hands. So, this is what I\u2019m doing in my farm practices."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Before the community-built tower brought the internet to his village, Aamer got his weather report by word-of-mouth - information passed on by people telling each other."},{"author":"Neil","text":"Now, there\u2019s stable internet that works thanks to a tower high enough to pick up a telephone signal which it then sends into the villages via solar-powered receivers \u2013 a  type of gadget , meaning a small, electronic device which does something useful."},{"author":"Sam","text":"This means Aamer now gets his weather report straight from the horse's mouth , an idiom meaning from a reliable source, or from someone who knows what they\u2019re talking about. The internet brings reliable climatic information, which means a good harvest not just for Aamer and his family, but for all the families living in the five connected villages."},{"author":"Neil","text":"It\u2019s a great example of community action, and of people looking after each other \u2013 something which may have been lost since the early, idealistic days of the internet. And speaking of the early internet, it\u2019s time to answer my question. Remember, I asked  you for the name of the very first internet browser."},{"author":"Sam","text":"I guessed it was c) Yahoo. So, was I right?"},{"author":"Neil","text":"You were\u2026 wrong, I\u2019m afraid, Sam. Way back before Google, the first internet browser was called the WorldWideWeb - invented by none other than cyber legend, Tim Berners-Lee, who, I think, would be pleased to hear about Aamer\u2019s community internet."},{"author":"Sam","text":"Yes. Right, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learnt about internet connections between people living at a physical distance in the modern world, something described as the global village."},{"author":"Neil","text":"If your internet is spasmodic , it\u2019s irregular, stopping then suddenly working for a short time. In other words, it\u2019s dodgy , a slang word meaning bad or unreliable"},{"author":"Sam","text":"If you know something by word-of-mouth , it\u2019s been passed verbally from person to person. Whereas if you hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth , it\u2019s come directly from a reliable source of information."},{"author":"Neil","text":"And finally, a gadget is a small, electronic device with a useful purpose. Once again our six minutes are up. Bye for now!"},{"author":"Sam","text":"Bye!"}],"authors":["Neil","Sam","World Service listener, Katie","Aamer
