I'm Rob."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And I'm Dan."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Hey Dan. What\u2019s the time?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Time you got a new watch?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now I didn\u2019t ask you that just for a joke or a sarcastic comment now did I?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well no, but look there\u2019s a clock over there, you are wearing a watch, you have a smartphone and a computer, all of which show the time. So why are you asking me?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Dan! I was trying to introduce today\u2019s topic which is all about virtual assistants or bots. You seemed to have forgotten the script."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Oh yes, sorry. We\u2019re talking about software that you talk to and that can talk back to you. Like Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana. It might be on your phone or computer or even a speaker in your house."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Now before we hear more about this topic, here is today\u2019s quiz question: Do you know when was the first computer which could recognise speech, launched? Was it in"},{"author":"Dan","text":"I have found my script, so I\u2019ve seen the answer but I have to say I was surprised."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Don't tell anybody Dan, OK. We\u2019ll give the answer for the listeners at the end of the programme. We\u2019re going to hear now from Tom Hewitson, who is a conversation designer, working in the field of virtual assistants, talking on BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth programme. He talks about the whole idea of virtual assistants and how they are changing the way we interact with technology. How does he describe our existing relationship with computers?"},{"author":"Tom Hewitson, Conversation Designer","text":"It changes the way that we think about computers. To date we\u2019ve thought of them largely as tools. They\u2019re just an advanced version of a calculator. They\u2019re something you kind of use to get a specific thing done, whereas this is kind of changing them more into like an agent . They\u2019re an active participant in the interaction and in guiding you to make the right decision."},{"author":"Rob","text":"How did he describe our existing relationship with computers then?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"He said that to date , which is an expression which means 'up until this point in time', we have thought of them as advanced calculators."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, that\u2019s right, we use them as a tool to get things done. But he says that modern technology is turning them into an agent . This doesn\u2019t mean a secret agent, like James Bond! In this sense an agent is something that has agency and that means it has the ability to act individually and make its own decisions."},{"author":"Dan","text":"I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like my phone to have agency . It probably wouldn\u2019t like being in my pocket all day."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Who would Dan? But I\u2019m not sure Hewitson is suggesting our devices would become that clever but he did say they could become more active in our lives."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Maybe. I imagine, for example, telling us if we are spending too much time in fast food restaurants?"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Maybe in your case Dan. Mine would be telling me I spend too much time in the gym! Hewitson goes on to explain how the way we will talk to our virtual assistants will develop. What does he say we don\u2019t need to do?"},{"author":"Tom Hewitson, Conversation Designer","text":"We will develop our own kind of vernacular for speaking with machines that will be subtly different from how we speak to other people because as you rightly point out you don\u2019t need to make the machine like you don\u2019t need to kind of make random chit-chat that\u2019s just filling the time. It can be much more brusque and to the point ."},{"author":"Dan","text":"A lot of what we say in human communication is to do with our relationship with the person we\u2019re talking to."},{"author":"Rob","text":"We say things and talk about things that are maybe not directly relevant to our point. With a digital virtual assistant, we don\u2019t need to do that, so we don\u2019t need to make the machine like us."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Hewitson said that we will develop our own vernacular , this is a general word for a native language. This vernacular will be a little bit different from our everyday vernacular because, as we said, we don\u2019t need to maintain a social relationship with the artificial assistant."},{"author":"Rob","text":"This means that we won\u2019t need chit-chat . Chit-chat is another expression for small talk: conversation topics which aren\u2019t important but are part of everyday social communication, like talking about the weather."},{"author":"Dan","text":"And because we don\u2019t need to be friends with our virtual assistants, we can be brusque and to the point . Both of these mean being very direct and not very polite."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Well Dan, I don\u2019t mean to be brusque but it is time for the answer to this week\u2019s quiz question. Earlier I asked when was the first computer which could recognise speech, launched. The options were:"},{"author":"Dan","text":"It was called the IBM Shoebox and could recognise 16 words and the numbers zero to nine. That\u2019s nearly as many as you!"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Cheeky! Right enough of this chat-chat . Let\u2019s recap today\u2019s vocabulary."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Well chit-chat was one of today\u2019s expressions. Meaning 'small talk', but we also had the expression to date . That means \u2018up until this moment in time\u2019."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Then we had the noun agent . This refers to something that has agency . And that is the ability to think, make decisions and act independently."},{"author":"Dan","text":"The next word is vernacular , another word for language, particularly when talking about a native language."},{"author":"Rob","text":"And finally there was brusque meaning 'direct and not polite' and to the point , which also means 'direct and without unnecessary information'."},{"author":"Dan","text":"Hey Rob"},{"author":"Rob","text":"Yes, what can I do for you Dan?"},{"author":"Dan","text":"End the programme."},{"author":"Rob","text":"Certainly Dan. Well that\u2019s all from us today, be sure to check us out on all the usual places: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course please don't forget our website bbclearningenglish.com.
