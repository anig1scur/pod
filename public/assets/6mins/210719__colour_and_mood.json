Is it\u2026 a) dispersion b) reflection, or c) refraction?"

      "text": "It\u2019s the way that we take in the wavelengths of light because colour is wavelengths of light, and it\u2019s how that comes in through our eye, and then it goes into the part of our brain called the hypothalamus, which governs our sleeping patterns, our hormones, our behaviours, our appetite \u2013 it governs everything and so different colours and different frequencies or different wavelengths of light, we have different responses and different reactions to them."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

But during the recent coronavirus pandemic, there was a rise in demand for intense, bright shades and patterns. This was referred to as \u2018happy design\u2019 - design that was meant to help lift our mood."

But what I have found since the first lockdown is a lot of people, because they\u2019re not getting that outside stimulation , they\u2019re actually putting a lot of brighter colours in their home because they\u2019re trying to bring in that feeling that they would have got when they were out \u2013 that excitement and that buzz."
