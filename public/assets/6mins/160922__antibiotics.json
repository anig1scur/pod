    "Alice and Neil discuss penicillin, the so-called wonder drug discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. They talk about Neil's sore toe, mouldy coffee mugs, and why drug companies should be looking at ways to extend the lifespan of antibiotics and find new ones."

So, Neil, can you tell me how many lives penicillin has saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Is it\u2026 a) 20 million? b) 200 million? Or c) 2 billion?"

Now, penicillin is a common antibiotic \u2013 or substance that kills microorganisms \u2013 that acts very effectively against certain bacteria. And it was discovered in 1928 by a Scottish scientist called Alexander Fleming who noticed some mould growing on a petri dish of bacteria in his lab, which had a halo \u2013 or circle \u2013 around it where no bacteria were growing."

So not only has penicillin opened the door for treating people with infection, it's also essentially paved the way for modern medicine, modern interventional medicine that we benefit from now."

      "desc": "Chemotherapy is a chemical treatment used to kill cancer cells that also suppresses \u2013 or stops \u2013 the body's immune system from working. The immune system is our body's defence against infection and disease. So cancer patients have to take antibiotics to prevent infections that the body can't fight off by itself."

    {
      "text": "Neil",

And it's because the moulds protect themselves with it. And in fact you find resistance to penicillin in the most unlikely places. You find it for example in corpses from before Columbus in the New World."

      "desc": "Yes. Good point, Neil, but washing your hands didn't cure your toe, did it? Now, remember I asked you earlier: How many lives has penicillin saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Was it\u2026 a) 20 million, b) 200 million or c) 2 billion?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Neil",
      "desc": "And I said b) 200 million. Alice And you were right! Penicillin became the most effective life-saving drug in the world, conquering diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, pneumonia, diphtheria, and scarlet fever and made Alexander Fleming an international hero for discovering it."
