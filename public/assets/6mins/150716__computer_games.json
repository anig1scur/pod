      "author": "Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor",

      "author": "Rob",

    {
      "author": "Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor",
      "text": "So it's a matter of educating the parents and the wider community in these issues, and making them aware of the type of content that's in there, and why it's inappropriate, and the effects that it may be having on their children and their behaviour."
    },
    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "Alan thinks it's the responsibility of parents and the wider community - now that means other groups of people, such as friends, relatives and teachers for example - to check on what children are viewing and playing."
