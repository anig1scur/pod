OK, Rob, I'd love to hear more about your learning strategies, but first here's today's quiz question for you. What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something? Is it \u2026 a) pneumatics b) mnemonics Or c) hypnotics? Rob I'll go for b) mnemonics. Alice Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show. Now, according to current scientific research, some study methods popular with students aren't actually very effective."

      "text": "Yes, I did, but without much success. Maybe I was using the wrong kind of pillow?! Alice Well, let's talk about more conventional methods than the book-under-the-pillow one. These include summarising, highlighting or underlining text to help you remember it\u2026 I do love a pack of highlighting pens, though."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Oh yes, me too. And actually highlighting text was one of my top tips. But I used to get so absorbed with the highlighting I'm not sure I was actually learning anything useful. My notebooks were works of art, though! Alice Yes, and that's the point made by John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US, who says that you need to do more than just highlight information. You need to test yourself on it. Let's hear from him now. INSERT John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US Students who can basically test themselves or try to retrieve material from their memory are going to learn that material in the long run a lot better. So for instance maybe you start by reading a textbook using your favourite highlighter and favourite colours, but then you go back and make flashcards of all the critical concepts and instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourselves on them. Rob Professor John Dunlosky there. So he says trying to memorise the material isn't enough. You need to do something with it, for example, making flashcards of critical \u2013 or important \u2013 concepts and then testing yourself on them. Alice By repeatedly testing yourself on something, you strengthen the pathways between neurons \u2013 or nerve cells \u2013 in the brain. And the more often you do this, the easier it becomes to retrieve information."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It sounds like hard work, though, doesn't it? I prefer the cramming method \u2013 which means to try and learn lots of information in a short period of time. For example, the night before the exam."

      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "I don't know, Rob. We don't cram to learn other things \u2013 like music or dancing, or football or language learning. It's far more effective to join a conversation class and practise speaking every week than to practise for hours in front of the mirror the night before your oral exam!"

      "text": "John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US I would encourage students as they are reading to try and elaborate mentally using images, as they're reading, to kind of develop a more vivid picture of what they're reading. Again, that'll help quite a bit for some kinds of studies \u2013 maybe history and so forth \u2013 and a little bit less so for more conceptual studies."
