      "text": "New research has found a remarkable link between bitter foods and our health. It seems they have an incredible ability to interact with our gut microbiome , suppress feelings of hunger, control glucose release and even counter chronic inflammation in the body. Could bitter be the answer at the tip of our tastebuds ?"

      "author": "Beth",

It includes fungi, bacteria and viruses. Microorganisms in our gut play an important role in the digestive process - they are our gut microbiome ."

      "author": "Phil",

Here we have tastebuds , which are the receptors on our tongue and inside our mouths that can detect flavours, like bitterness."

      "author": "Alexina Anatole",
      "text": "I think it's a real perception issue with it. I think people are exposed to bitters way more than they think they are, but there's this perception of bitter and negativity, both in terms of emotions and food, right? Bitterness is generally an undesirable trait , but there are so many very very mainstream bitter things."

We often see bitterness as a bad thing. We also often use undesirable traits to refer to negative aspects of people's personalities."
