      "text": "So you have a friend, a significant other , your parents\u2026 and you have the feeling that this relationship is threatened by someone else starting some form of relationship with them, starting a new friendship, you know, flirting with them and so on, which is different from envy , for example, which is probably the emotion that gets you to act when someone has something you want and you have to somehow get that from them \u2013 that\u2019s when you feel envious."

      "text": "Dr Mielke also notes the difference between two words people often confuse: jealousy, and a similar term, envy - wanting what someone else has. You could be envious of someone\u2019s possessions like a new car, their achievements like promotion at work, or a personal quality like being funny or good-looking."
