      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University, UK The sensory information is just relayed directly into your brain. One part of it is routed into the cortex, where it's sort of thought about: 'that's that thing, I know that from last time I experienced this', and you can kind of rationalise your way through it. But it also sends a message directly to the amygdala, which immediately triggers the 'fight or flight' response \u2013 bang, fire alarm, off it goes, flood the body just in case. It's a survival mechanism."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "That's right \u2013 Or for me, it's a dog getting anywhere near me! Anyway, this information goes into our brains and is processed in two different parts of the brain \u2013 the central cortex and the amygdala."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And the information sent to the central cortex triggers a rational response, like, oh it's only a harmless moth \u2013 and the stuff that goes to the amygdala triggers an instinctive reaction \u2013 the fight or flight response \u2013 like, aaarrrggghhh! It's a disgusting moth! Get away from me!"

    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "The fight or flight response is a normal response to stress or danger, and it involves the hormone adrenalin being pumped quickly round the body. The problem is this response can get triggered when there isn't any danger. And this is at the heart of what a phobia is."

    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "Yes, but recent research has shown that we have a reflexive awareness of spiders \u2013 whether we fear them or not \u2013 which means we can spot them automatically without thinking about it. And we don't have the same reflexive awareness of houseflies \u2013 or moths \u2013 for example."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "I expect this awareness is to do with our ancestors. It would've been extremely useful to spot a spider as an early human on the plains of the African Savannah. A bite might kill you \u2013 or make you vulnerable to attack from other animals."

Entomophobia (also known as insectophobia) is a specific phobia characterized by an excessive or unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect. Thanatophobia is the fear of death and pogonophobia is the fear of beards or bearded people."
