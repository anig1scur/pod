And that kind of cooperation is at the heart , I think, of a lot of social interactions for humans and I think that\u2019s one of the strong pushes to make conversation polite and therefore frequently not actually truthful."

That\u2019s just dishonest, but there are also what I like to call white lies \u2013 small lies we tell to avoid upsetting someone. Those are lies that aren\u2019t intended to give you an advantage."

      "text": "Liars in general say less. They tend to have a longer what's called response latency , which is the time between the end of the question and the beginning of the answer. And there also tends to be an emotional distance in the lie \u2013 so the words \u2018me\u2019,\u2019my\u2019, \u2018I\u2019 \u2013 all those things tend to drop away in lies and it\u2019s much much harder for liars to control what they\u2019re saying and how they\u2019re saying it, so focus your attention there, you become a better lie detector."

So to detect lies we need to listen out for the response latency \u2013 a term used in psychology to describe the time taken between a stimulus or question and a response to it. The bigger the gap, the more chance there is that someone is lying. Is that a good summary, Sam?"
