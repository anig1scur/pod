      "text": "Moving on now, punctuation was invented by the Ancient Greeks. They used a series of dots to indicate different lengths of pauses. A short unit of text was a comma, a longer unit was a colon, and a complete sentence was a periodos. We used these terms to name our punctuation marks \u2013 although they actually refer to the clauses not to the dots themselves. Neil So early punctuation wasn't about grammar, then?"

      "author": "Alice",

We started to associate the marks, not just with pauses, but with the actual grammatical units that were used to punctuate. So, a comma wasn't just a dot that meant, pause for this length of time. It now actually marked out a clause, you know, it marked out a sort of consistent logical bit of writing."

      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "So rhetoric \u2013 or the art of persuasive speaking \u2013 was very important to the Greeks and to the Romans. And to be persuasive, you need to be understood. And these little punctuation marks helped the speaker to deliver their text more effectively."

      "author": "Neil",

KH: You might say that emoticons are the best way to go about that \u2013 a little winking emoticon \u2013 you know, semicolon, dash, closing parenthesis.
