  "intro": [
    "If a child is born in the summer, their parents could delay their start of school by up to a year. That would be the effect of a proposal made by a UK Minister who wishes to change school admissions. Listen in to Rob and Neil to find out if the proposal is likely to solve the problem - and learn some related vocabulary at the same time!"
