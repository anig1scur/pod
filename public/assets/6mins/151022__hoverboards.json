  "intro": [
    "The bicycle is the most popular form of two-wheeled transport in the world, but could we all soon be using hoverboards? They look like a skateboards and are used by pop stars such as Lilly Allen and Justin Bieber. Listen to what happens when a BBC reporter tries  a hoverboard, and learn some new vocabulary."

    },
    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "Yes. And, you know, the other big difference is that it is motorised. And when you change your balance the wheels turn. So when you lean forwards \u2013 you move forwards \u2013 and when you lean back you slow down and stop\u2026 and if you lean even further back, then you actually move backwards."

      "author": "Neil",

It's a self-balancing transportation device or some people call them rideables. I've never had a go but I am going to integrate one into my life in the next couple of days and see how I get on ."

You could hear them shouting: \"Can I have a go? Can I have a go? Can I have a go ?\" Now, to have a go means to try something."

It's really heavy, it's illegal to use it on the pavement and it's quite embarrassing being stared at. So are two wheels better than two legs? For me, probably not."
