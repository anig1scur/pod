    "A Shakespeare festival in Oregon has commissioned 'translations' of his plays into plain English. Of course, the language of Shakespeare's plays can be difficult, but is it a good idea to change his plays into simple English? Listen to experts talking about Shakespeare and learn new vocabulary."

You know, he exists in all of these different places and all of these different forms and I suppose that what really struck me while working on my book and travelling around the world talking to people about Shakespeare is that he is so multifarious - he exists in all of these places. It feels sometimes that we in the English-speaking world are only just catching up with this."
