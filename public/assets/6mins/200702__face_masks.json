So we\u2019re thrown back on first principles and this is why, as in so many areas of public health, you get such a heated debate because people are really relying on their opinion on things and you will have one group who say, 'Well, it stands to reason' ,- the good old \u2018stands to reason\u2019 argument \u2013 which is: obviously, if you\u2019ve got a covering in front of your face, and you\u2019re speaking or coughing into that covering, it\u2019s going to trap quite a lot of the virus on the droplets you\u2019ll be emitting."
