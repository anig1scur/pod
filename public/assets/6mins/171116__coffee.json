      "author": "Rob",

Everybody was sitting on their own, tapping away on their laptops. Let's listen now to Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor, describing the vibe \u2013 or atmosphere \u2013 in a typical 21st century caf\u00e9\u2026"

The flow of bytes through this coffee shop's free wifi is transporting these customers to diverse destinations far from the person beside them. Collaborative working, a research grant application, a potential blockbuster novel, and inevitably, someone distracted by kitten pictures on social media."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "I think the caf\u00e9 owners should turn off the free wifi and force these caf\u00e9 squatters to move on! I don't think people should be allowed to sit all day using the internet \u2013 hogging tables \u2013 and not talking to anybody! Especially when some of them don't even buy a coffee!"

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "That's a bit extreme, Rob. Caf\u00e9 owners need customers \u2013 and they encourage people to stay by having comfy sofas and newspapers to read and the free wifi! A squatter , by the way, is someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. And if you hog something you use most or all of it in a selfish way."
