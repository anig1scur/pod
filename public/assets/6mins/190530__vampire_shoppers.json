That's what we'll be talking about in this programme \u2013 an activity known as 'vampire shopping'.  But before we continue, it's my job to set you a quiz question, so here goes. According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, at the end of 2018, what percentage of all retail sales took place online? Was it\u2026 a)  9.8%, b) 19.8%, or c) 29.8%?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, you\u2019ll have to wait a bit to find out. But let's talk more now about vampire shopping \u2013 this term refers to shopping late at night - traditionally a time when vampires appear."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Most of us are asleep at this time but sleep-deprived parents, shift-workers and gamers might not be. If you're an insomniac \u2013 someone who can't sleep easily \u2013 it's tempting to open up your laptop and start shopping."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Online shops are open 24 hours a day so it's easy to get sucked in and do some shopping!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "When you get sucked into something it means you can't stop yourself getting involved with something that you didn't want to do. So what you're saying Neil is at night, when we're very tired, we don't always think straight and can make some bad decisions."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "That's right. And this shopping temptation can be particularly problematic for those with mental health issues. It's something Helen Undy has been talking about on the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours. She is the Chief Executive of the Money and Mental Health Institute. Let's hear what she had to say\u2026"

      "text": "Our ability to control our impulse to spend and to resist things like advertising is reduced when we're sleep deprived . Well mental health problems can have a similar effect so the mental health problems themselves make it harder to resist the urge to spend and they also cause sleep deprivation, so  you're alone possibly surfing the internet, and both the lack of sleep and the mental health problems make it harder to resist the things that you can see."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Helen said that for all us, when we're sleep deprived \u2013 that means not having enough sleep \u2013 we find it harder to resist the urge to shop. We're more sucked in to shopping by the advertising we see."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And resist the urge means stop yourself acting on a strong feeling to do something. But this is more serious for people with mental health issues. They are particularly sleep deprived and along with everything that's going on in their minds, they find it harder to resist \u2013 to stop themselves buying things."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "I suppose buying things at night, if you're alone, gives you some comfort - even a feel-good factor \u2013 doing something that gives someone a happy and positive feeling. I certainly feel good when I've bought something. But Rob, have you ever bought something you regret ?"
    },

      "text": "Regret is a sad feeling you get when you've made a mistake and wished you hadn't made the mistake in the first place. We all have regrets Rob, particularly when buying things \u2013 but there's usually the option to return something and get a refund."

      "text": "We found in our research that 75% of people, so regardless of whether you've got a mental health problem or not - three-quarters of people didn't send back the last thing they bought online that they regretted .  We found that 4 in 10 people with mental health problems didn't send things back because they were so ashamed of the things that they were buying that they just wanted to pretend it never happened."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
