These tend to be entrepreneurial young people who want to work on their own projects alongside their main source of income. Are you one of them? Neil and Rob discuss side hustles and teach you related vocabulary."

Those aged 25 to 34 are most likely to be involved with 37% thought to run a sideline of some kind. A sideline also describes an extra job you do alongside your main job. BBC Radio 5 Live spoke to someone whose side hustle was so satisfying that that it turned into her day job. Here is Elspeth Jackson, founder of Ragged Life, to explain why."

But now I don't think I could go back to one of these big companies because you'd essentially be sacrificing the flexibility which is something I've become very accustomed to now."

Audit managers are responsible for organising and overseeing internal audits. The result was based on three factors: average annual base salary, the current number of job openings, and job satisfaction, according to ratings shared by employees on the website over the past 12 months."
