It was made up during her first term in office by hardline conservatives in her predominantly male party. A patronising put down behind her back. Given her dry academic distinctly un-cuddly style, it was meant to be slighly ironic to put her in her place as a woman, possibly even meant to be hurtful, given that in reality she has no children."
