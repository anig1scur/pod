    "Climate change is reaching emergency levels. Some people think the best option is renewable energy. Others prefer a return to nuclear energy, arguing that it\u2019s clean, green and more reliable that renewables. But after the infamous nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima, questions about its safety remain. Neil and Sam talk about nuclear energy, as they teach you related vocabulary."

So, this is, sort of, ingrained in people\u2019s minds, and for many it hasn\u2019t been \u2026 really been updated."
