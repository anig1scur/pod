There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as \u2018man flu\u2019. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only \u2018suggestive\u2019 and are not \u2018definitive\u2019."

Dan I\u2019m sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining . If you whine , you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way. Neil Like my children did last time I didn\u2019t buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms . These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan? Dan A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that\u2019s the end of this 6 Minute English! Don\u2019t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it.
