      "text": "But in some countries, female farmers face a different problem growing and selling vegetables - sexism , the mistreatment of one sex based on the belief that the other is better, usually that men are better than women. According to the United Nations, over 40% of farmers globally are women, a number which rises to almost 50% in lower and middle-income countries. Although these women manage farms, look after crops, and sell their produce at market, female farmers face sexism in societies where women are expected to raise children and stay at home."

And, as usual, you\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But first I have a question for you, Beth. According to the UN\u2019s World Food Programme, or WFP, what is the world\u2019s most popular vegetable? Is it:"

Although around half of Bangladeshi farmers are female, they\u2019re not always welcome at the marketplace, where they face harassment, or are underpaid for their produce."

Here\u2019s Poppy telling more to, Salman Saeed, reporter for BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:"

      "text": "By selling here, we get more profit. For example, if we sell a product in the market at 30 Taka, we can sell it here at 32 or 33 Taka. That's what makes us very happy! It also saves time, as after selling the products, we can come home and spend time with the family and can also work in the vegetable garden."

      "author": "Salman Saeed",
      "text": "33 Taka is about 30 US cents, with 300 women currently using the app in Bangladesh. And while the three cents extra might sound small, over the course of the year, as prices fluctuate the WFP say the average monthly revenue for each farmer using the app has risen dramatically. In the long run, the hope is that it will also be possible to challenge and change attitudes around gender, but in the meantime the extra money she makes per sale makes a big difference to Poppy and her family."

      "text": "Although the app only increases Poppy\u2019s profits a little, they soon add up because vegetable prices fluctuate , they continually change, moving up and down. According to the WFP, the incomes of farmers using the app have risen dramatically , they have increased suddenly and  surprisingly."

It\u2019s good news for female farmers in Bangladesh, but problems continue in many other places, often because it\u2019s the man in the family who controls the household finances."
