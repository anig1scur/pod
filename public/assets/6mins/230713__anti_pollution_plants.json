      "text": "OK, Neil. We'll find out the correct answer later. Phytoremediating plants are certainly needed in one of the most oil polluted places on Earth \u2013 the delta of the River Niger in Nigeria. Ever since oil, known by the nickname, black gold, was discovered there in the 1950s, it's become central to Nigeria's economy. But oil spills have devastated the region\u2019s landscape, and there is mistrust between local communities and the multinational oil companies working there."

Discussing Eucharia\u2019s work are, Georgina Rannard, from the BBC climate news team, and, Myra Anubi, presenter of BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World:"
