      "text": "And hello, I'm Neil. Our topic today is transport. How do you think you'll be travelling to work in, say 30 years' time?"

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, not only will homeworking be more prevalent \u2013 that means \u2018common\u2019 \u2013 but I hope I won't be working in 30 years' time!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Good answer! But if we look back and see how transport has changed in the last 30 years, it makes you wonder what the future holds."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, we've seen how air travel has become commonplace for many people. Commonplace means \u2018not unusual\u2019. And there's been the development of high-speed train travel. But the main priority has been speed \u2013 going faster to make your journeys quicker."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "That's true, and we'll be discussing some ideas for making transport even faster soon. But let's not waste any time and speed on to today's quiz question. Rob Ah yes, time waits for no one, not even you Neil. So can you answer this question? According to Guinness World Records, in which country has the fastest ever train been recorded? Is it in\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "All these countries have fast trains but I've heard that Chinese trains go particularly fast. I'm going to say a) China."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the programme to see if you're right. But let's talk more now about the future of transport. One development we hear much about is automation ."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Automation means \u2018using machines to do work that humans normally do\u2019 and in terms of transport this means driverless vehicles. It won't be too long before we become the passenger in a driverless car."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Scary! And the French train engineering company, Alstom, is planning to test automated freight trains later this year. The automated train prototype can travel for about 100 kilometres without driver intervention. A prototype is the first version of something which can be tested before it is produced in large quantities."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Of course some trains are already driven by computers but there's an exciting plan to develop a form of driverless vehicle that could move you around at 1,123 kilometres per hour."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Come on Neil. That sounds a bit far-fetched \u2013 like flying cars that we see in sci-fi movies \u2013 it's difficult to believe because it's unlikely to happen."

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "The idea is, you get loaded into a pod then you're pushed through a metal tube at high speed, taking you to your destination in minutes rather than hours. Anita Sengupta is the lead systems engineer and says there's nothing scary about it\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Anita Sengupta, Lead systems engineer, Virgin Hyperloop One The Hyperloop is a maglev train in a vacuum system \u2013 or in a vacuum tube \u2013 and so you can also think of it as an aircraft flying at 200,000 feet so people don't have any issue flying in aeroplanes and people don't have any issue going in maglev trains. This is simply combining the two and allows you to be more energy efficient."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So Anita Sengupta explained the type of technology the Hyperloop used. First she mentioned maglev \u2013 that's a short way of saying magnetic levitation."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "It's when trains travel on magnetic track rather than conventional rails. Rob And then she mentioned a vacuum system - a vacuum is a space that has had all the air and any other gases removed from it. So the tube these pods travel in have no air in so there's no resistance. And these technologies are more efficient and they save energy."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Which is a good thing. This sounds like a great way to travel but will it take off?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones isn't so sure. He thinks it will be quite challenging to convince governments to allow long metal tubes to be built on or below ground."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But we have to try these new technologies Rob. If we didn't we'd still be travelling around on horse and cart!"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "A good point Neil \u2013 and we wouldn't have been able to travel at the great speeds mentioned in today's question. Now earlier I asked you according to Guinness World Records, in which country has the fastest ever train travelled? Is it in\u2026"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And I said a) China."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Which means \u2018not unusual or often seen\u2019. For example 'free Wi-Fi in coffee shops is commonplace these days.'"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And very useful it is too! Next we had automation , meaning \u2018using a machine to do something instead of a human.\u2019 'Automation in the car making industry has led to the loss of hundreds of jobs.'"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Of course when you build a new car you need to make a prototype \u2013 that's the first version of something which can be tested before it is produced in large quantities. 'The prototype of a new solar-powered bike has been so successful that it's now going into mass-production.'"

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well something people once thought far-fetched is now a reality and that's maglev \u2013 that's short for magnetic levitation and is how some of the world's fastest trains travel."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Finally, we discussed the word vacuum . It's a space that has had all the air and other gases removed from it \u2013 basically an empty space. 'The plan for Virgin's Hyperloop One is to make a maglev even faster by putting it in a vacuum tube.' And that brings us to the end of today\u2019s 6 Minute English.
