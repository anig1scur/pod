  "intro": [
    "Shopping online is a popular activity. Many of us use the internet to look for things to buy and to compare prices, but some of us never make it to the virtual checkout where we have to pay for them. We discuss this activity known as 'surf and turf' - and hear from an expert who thinks retailers need to do something about it."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, it is. Now, you probably know that 'surfing' is a verb we use for looking at things on the internet. Surf and turf refers to when we go to an online store, select lots of things for our virtual shopping basket but when we get to the checkout , which is the place where we pay for our shopping, we don't actually complete the purchase. We turf out the basket. We abandon it."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "And it was calculated that this meant there was approximately 18 billion pounds worth of lost sales."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "I have to say, I'm a bit sceptical about that figure. I don't trust it. We don't always intend to buy everything we put in our baskets. It's a bit like window shopping. We just browse and find it convenient to put things in our basket to think about later. Have you ever done that?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Sure. It's a bit like browsing in a shop, isn't it \u2013 except you can save items you are interested in to look at later. You might also make a basket in one online store, then go to another to see if you can get the same or similar items cheaper there. So I agree: I don't think that the figure of 18 billion represents a total. Some of that was never intended to be spent \u2013 and some would have gone to other stores."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "But there are other reasons we don't complete our purchases. For some it's finding out at the end that there will be a high delivery cost or that paying is very complicated."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, I agree with that. That's so annoying. You spend time collecting all the things in the basket, then find you have to create an account, or you can't use your favourite payment method, or have to pay more to use a credit card and you have to fill out so many details. Sometimes you get so frustrated that you just give up."

This is where they make a mistake and get into trouble \u2013 where they can lose customers. Right, before we fall foul of the listener, let's have the answer to the quiz. I asked you which items were the most commonly abandoned at the virtual checkout. Was it books, watches or women\u2019s knitwear? So Neil, what did you say?"
