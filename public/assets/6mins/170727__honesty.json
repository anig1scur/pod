      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, it's where you pay for something by putting money in a box \u2013 but it's up to you to put in the right amount. A small business might use this method to take money for things like parking your car or buying a newspaper because it means you don't need a sales assistant."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

We can use the adverb 'honestly' at the beginning of a sentence to show that we're feeling irritated \u2013 for example when your co-presenter picks a quiz question that's too easy!"

      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Philip Graves, Psychologist and author of the book Consumerology The question is not 'Are most consumers honest, the question is 'Are most people honest?' \u2013 And the answer to that is 'no'. We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest. It's part of our evolutionary psychological make up \u2013 because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us, we have a greater chance of surviving. Now what's important in that is that we also benefited from being in a social group and that was important in our evolutionary past so there is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can feather our own nest, so to speak, and the risk of being ostracised by the group."

OK let's follow Franklin's wise words and move right ahead with the vocabulary items we learned today."
