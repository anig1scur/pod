This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon. BBC Learning English's very creative scriptwriter Rob and Neil discuss what it takes to be creative - and they also teach you related vocabulary."

This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon \u2013 and that's what we'll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?"

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, and we'll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That's perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries \u2013 that's businesses that make music, art and TV for example \u2013 are world famous. We are creative people, Rob!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Of course, but there's not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It's something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4's Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?"

    {
      "author": "Bernadette Duffy, early years consultant",
      "text": "We focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that's what's going to make a difference for the future."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately \u2013 which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don't teach a creative approach to learning skills."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it's sometimes good to 'think outside the box' or find new ways of doing things."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace \u2013 that's when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I'm lying in the bath or out riding my bike \u2013 there are no interruptions."
