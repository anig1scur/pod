      "text": "I saw a news article written by BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones about the recent CES technology show in Las Vegas. He interviewed David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, who said it was his ambition to achieve an AI that can beat humans at any intellectual task."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Surely it\u2019s a good thing! Better AI and robotics could take over many of the jobs that we don\u2019t want to do, or that are so important to get 100% right\u2026 like air traffic control. We\u2019d never have another plane crash. It would be infallible because it would be so clever."

    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Infallible means never failing. And that\u2019s what bothers me. What happens when its intelligence surpasses ours? Why should it do what we want it to do?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "To surpass something is to do or be better than it. Dan, you\u2019ve been watching too many movies. Robots fighting humanity is a popular theme. Guess what\u2026 humanity often wins. And besides, we would programme the computer to be benevolent."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Benevolent means kind and helpful. But that\u2019s just it, once the intelligence becomes sentient, or able to think for itself, who knows what it will do. We humans are not exactly perfect, you know. What happens if it decides that it is better than us and wants us out of the way?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Don\u2019t worry. Asimov thought of that. Isaac Asimov was an American science fiction writer who, among other things, wrote about robots. He came up with three laws that every robot would have to follow to stop it from acting against humanity. So we\u2019re safe!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "I\u2019m not so sure. A sentient robot could make up its own mind about how to interpret the laws. For example, imagine if we created an AI system to protect all of humanity."

      "author": "Dan",
      "text": "Do you really think that humans can stop fighting? What if the AI decides that the only way to stop us from hurting ourselves and each other is to control everything we do, so it takes over to protect us. Then we would lose our freedom to a thing that we created that is infallible and more intelligent than we are! That\u2019s the end, Neil!"

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Indeed. Many people wonder about the possibility of sentient life on other planets. Finally we heard far-fetched, which means difficult to believe. Like that far-fetched story you told me the other day about being late because of a dragon, Dan."
