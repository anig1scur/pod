  "intro": [
    "Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen. Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Sometimes we are just drawn to pushing them, but as this programme discusses, some people have a button phobia."

Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?"

On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they've got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push \u2013 like put behind glass or something."

So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn\u2019t get the better of us."
