  "intro": [
    "Episodes of extreme weather seem to be more frequent and some scientists suspect this might be caused by human-induced climate change. Climatologist Geert Jan van Oldenborgh talks about a heatwave that surprised climate modellers because it exceeded even the worst expectations. Neil and Sam discuss the topic and teach you related vocabulary."
