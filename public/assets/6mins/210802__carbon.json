I think we all agree we want to reduce our carbon footprint somehow \u2013 but according to the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions, how many tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually could be reduced by living car-free? Is it\u2026 a) Around 1 tonne, b) Around 2 tonnes, or c) Around 3 tonnes?"

At the end of the day, we're doing it because we believe that this is what consumers will ask from business - this is not something that we made up ourselves."

      "author": "Sam",

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Sam",

The Climate Question programme also spoke to Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke \u2013 an expert in supply chain management at Northumbria University.  What does she call measuring a product\u2019s carbon footprint?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke, Northumbria University",
      "text": "The problem with footprinting is it's almost impossible to include the consumption stage associated with the consumer because we all deal with the products that we purchase and dispose of differently. So, it's very difficult to include that - so \u2018 farm-to-fork\u2019 calculations tend to really be \u2018farm-to-retail-shelf\u2019 calculations of carbon footprint loadings."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "So, Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke describes the measurement of a product\u2019s carbon footprint as \u2018 foot printing\u2019 . And this, she says, is difficult to measure because we don\u2019t know what people do with the stuff after they have bought it."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, so for example a carbon label might show an estimate of the carbon footprint of milk from the cow to the consumer \u2013 what Dr Zaina Gadema-Cooke calls \u2018 farm to fork\u2019 \u2013 but after it leaves the supermarket shelf, we don\u2019t know how efficiently it is stored, how much is wasted and what happens to the packaging."
