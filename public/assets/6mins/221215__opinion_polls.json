    "Predicting the future is not easy but that's exactly the job of opinion pollsters - researchers who ask people questions to discover what they think about certain topics. Neil and Sam look at the inventor of the opinion poll and discuss if they always give the right results, and they teach you some related vocabulary as well."

But what was the final split between those who voted to leave and those who wanted to remain? Was it: a) 51 leave to 49 remain? b) 52 leave to 48 remain? c) 52 remain to 48 leave?",

Basically to figure out early methodologies in advertising. And then by 1931 or so, he's wondering: well, if it works for toothpaste, why not politics?"

Making accurate election predictions depends on polling a sample group of people who accurately represent the population as a whole. One of the reasons for pollsters failure to predict Trump\u2019s election in 2016 is that they didn\u2019t ask enough white, non-college educated voters."
