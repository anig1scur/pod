Decisions that are contrary to \u2013 or against \u2013 what we really think. A psychology experiment conducted in the 1950s showed that a lot of people do exactly that \u2013 they submit to the will of the group."

So if somebody steps out of line, all us nonconformists, in this frightened conformist way, tear them apart. It's like we're defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people on the outside."
