    "Many people feel uncomfortable about the idea of talking to people they don't know, but this is something that could be good for their state of mind. Neil and Georgina discuss research that says that seemingly inconsequential conversations with new people can have a beneficial effect on our mood and wellbeing. And our presenters feel good about teaching you related vocabulary!"

But the other person doesn't know any of that and they\u2019re probably\u2026 they might be anticipating that they won't have a positive conversation and then they do.
