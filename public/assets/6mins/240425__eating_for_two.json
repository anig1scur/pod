You\u2019re asking, \u2018Are you pregnant?\u2019 And like many of the idioms we commonly use in English, this phrase contains a little bit of truth. A pregnant woman really is eating for two \u2013 herself and the baby growing inside her."

Although eating healthy and nutritious food is important for mums and babies, the story gets complicated because of the changes a woman\u2019s body goes through during pregnancy. Here\u2019s Jaega Wise, presenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme, reporting on her experience of pregnancy:"

I can count the amount of nosebleeds pre-pregnancy I\u2019ve had on one hand and now I seem to get them all the time."

For example, she had lots of nosebleeds whereas before being pregnant, she could count the number of nosebleeds she had on one hand . The idiom to count the number of something on one hand emphasises that this does not happen very often, or that there\u2019s a small number of something \u2013 after all, you can only count to five on one hand!"

It is a very critical window, but at the same time it can be the time when all you want to do is to eat chips because your body is going through what it perceives to be physiological stress. So it's doing the best that you can, and it's absolutely not about giving yourself a hard time."

Nowadays when someone talks about the cat-o\u2019-nine-tails , they are probably talking about the ways people sometimes use to punish themselves if they feel guilty."

Pregnancy is a special time of life, and all a baby can ask is that mum does her best. And, of course, avoids some foods, which reminds me of your question, Georgie \u2013 which food does the NHS recommend pregnant woman do not eat? I guessed it was smoked salmon\u2026"

Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in the programme, starting with the idiom eating for two which means to be pregnant."
