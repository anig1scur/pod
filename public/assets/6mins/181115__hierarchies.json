      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin' Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That's chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here's Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock."
    },
    {
      "author": "Margaret Heffernan",
      "text": "He compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They've achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that's what we do at work."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Which flock was most successful?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes, but why was that?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity . This noun refers to the amount of work that's done. So, on an individual level, the super-chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they 'stopped the other chickens from being productive' by killing them."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, what do we learn from this experiment?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there's a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy . How are those hierarchies different though? Here's Margaret Heffernan again."
    },
    {
      "author": "Margaret Heffernan",
      "text": "So chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that's where we get the term pecking order from. But it's one that they create among themselves, rather than one that's imposed upon them."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn't imposed . That means a good hierarchy isn't forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Pecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens."
