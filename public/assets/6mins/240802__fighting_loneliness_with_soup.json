And, as usual, we\u2019ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Here in the UK, an organisation called the \u2018Campaign to End Loneliness\u2019 has been offering advice and support since 2011. So according to the Campaign, what proportion of British adults report feeling lonely at least some of the time? Is it:"

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, Beth, I\u2019ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Feeling lonely is not necessarily the same as being alone. Some people can happily spend lots of time on their own, while others may be surrounded by people but still feel disconnected."

      "text": "It\u2019s that feeling when you crave people\u2019s company and you find it hard to connect. Or maybe you just feel left out with no one to turn to. Now, feeling lonely isn't just uncomfortable, when it's experienced over time, it's been associated with health issues like a higher risk of having depression, dementia, or even heart disease."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Someone who suffered all these feelings was Bep de Bruin. In 2013, Bep, aged 74, was found dead at her home in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Her death wasn\u2019t suspicious, but it shocked the whole country, because it turned out she had been dead for 10 years! Bep had lost contact with her only child and kept to herself in her apartment. So when she died sometime in 2003, no-one realised."

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Bep\u2019s tragic story inspired a national campaign to combat loneliness, including one project called, Oma\u2019s Soup, a kitchen bringing lonely elderly people together with schoolchildren and students to make soup. \u2018Oma\u2019 means \u2018grandma\u2019 in Dutch and the project encourages young people to spend time with their grandparent\u2019s generation."

      "author": "Claire Bates",
      "text": "Well, it's run by two young guys called Max Kranendijk and Martijn Canters. And now they were concerned their grandparents\u2019 generation were becoming isolated and lonely. And meanwhile they had lots of student friends who had free time, so they thought why not try to bring these two generations together through making soup."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Oma\u2019s Soup was started by Max and Martijn, two local guys , or men. They wanted to involve their student friends because they had lots of free time , time when they do not have to work or study, and can do what they want."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Max and Martijn found the perfect way to help elderly people who felt lonely by bringing them together with students. If you bring someone together , youhelp people or groups to become friendly or to do something together, especially something they wouldn\u2019t usually do\u2026 like make soup."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Oma\u2019s Soup has been a big success and has spread to other cities across the Netherlands, including Rotterdam, the hometown of Bep de Bruin, making her tragic death the spark for something much more hopeful. I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil."

    },

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Which was\u2026 the wrong answer I'm afraid, Beth. Sadly, the correct answer is even higher -  49 percent of adults, that\u2019s around 26 million people in the UK, making it even more important to reach out and connect with others. OK, it\u2019s time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with the verb crave , to have a strong wish or desire for something."
