This says 'fat-free' on it and it's been marketed as being quite healthy. If I was to say how much sugar is in here, what would you say as\u2026 say is the quantity of the tub? Interviewee: I\u2019d probably think maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls, you know, it\u2019s quite surprising how much is sugars in all these products, isn\u2019t there? Reporter: Well, there\u2019s about a third of this yoghurt pot is actually sugar. Interviewee: To be honest, that\u2019s quite amazing, that. I would never have thought a third of that would have been sugar just by looking at it. And it does say it\u2019s fat-free."

I think this is the wrong way forward. Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet. It is important also to enjoy your food and not do this extreme focusing on one side or one aspect and individual nutrients."
