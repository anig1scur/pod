That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be exploring in this programme while looking at some relevant vocabulary. But, sorry, Neil, I\u2019m going to start with a maths question! It\u2019s thought the largest number in the world is called a googol. It\u2019s written with a 1 and how many zeros? Is it\u2026 a)    A hundred zeros b)    A thousand zeros, or c)    Ten thousand zeros?"

      "text": "OK. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later on. But let\u2019s talk more about the fear of numbers now. Of course, numbers are important in our lives but one bad experience at school can put us off them for life. \u2018 Put off\u2019 means make someone dislike something."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "What put me off maths was it was not only complicated but very theoretical \u2013 and not very practical \u2013 useful for real-life situations. And the problem now is, it\u2019s easy to be fooled by fancy figures that we get told about."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "This is something The Why Factor programme on BBC World Service has been exploring. They spoke to Charles Seife, who\u2019s an author and professor at New York University, who explained why we are at the mercy of people who throw numbers at us\u2026."

    {
      "author": "Charles Seife, author and professor, New York University",
      "text": "Because we are primed not to question numbers, certain people have learned that numbers are perhaps the most powerful tools for deception... advertisers, marketers, politicians, who try to convince the public through spurious oratory - have learned that the one thing they can't get challenged on is numbers or challenges are ineffective."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Interesting words from Charles Seife there. He explains that numbers might be a powerful tool for deceiving people. Many of us are primed \u2013 so, told to behave in a certain situation and in a certain way \u2013 not to question numbers, accept them as fact."
    },
    {
      "author": "Sam",
      "text": "Yes, and this is dangerous. So, when politicians, for example, do good and effective public speaking \u2013 known as oratory \u2013 the information they give could be spurious \u2013 that means false, not correct or inaccurate. But numbers are more persuasive \u2013 they make you believe something is true."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So, unless you\u2019re confident with numbers, you\u2019re unlikely to challenge the facts and figures that you are given. So, Sam, if I said to you ten per cent of the ten million people who eat meat have a twenty per cent chance of being five per cent overweight \u2013 would you challenge that?"

      "text": "Well, interestingly, The Why Factor programme explained that girls are more anxious about learning maths, but even if they feel more nervous about maths, they aren\u2019t any worse with numbers than their more confident classmates. It\u2019s just the fear that\u2019s stopping you!"
