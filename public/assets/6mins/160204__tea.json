In the 19th c entury the British started to grow tea in India in order to compete with Chinese tea production.

What do you mean by mindfulness? CH: Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism. The Japanese tea ceremony for example has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence. Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now \u2013 forget about the past, forget about the future, and enjoy this specific moment. And that's what I call mindfulness."
