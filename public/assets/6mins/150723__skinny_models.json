    },
    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "Well, yeah, I think some models do look fantastic but others look painfully thin. Now, the media , by the way, refers to the different ways information is communicated to us, so, for example, through TV, radio, magazines, and often the internet and newspapers."

      "author": "Rob",

      "text": "I think it's a BMI of 18 or less, that's hopefully going to be banned by the French Assembly today. This is what the US health organization states as being kind of clinically unhealthy. So it's almost like a cut-off point. Yes, be thin, yes be thinner than the general population, but once it starts getting to unhealthy territory really that's time to start banning it."
    },
    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "And the French Assembly did pass this law a few days later. Now, did you spot the phrase for a limit or an ending? It's cut-off point ."

    {
      "author": "Rob",

      "author": "Finn",

    {
      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "That's right. It's a good point. And that's why the French authorities and those of some other countries are using BMI as a way of deciding. So, models with a BMI of 18 or less weigh too little when compared to how tall they are."

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So the problem with the modelling industry is that the agents who employ the girls put pressure on \u2013 or strongly persuade \u2013 them to lose weight."

      "author": "Finn",

    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It's because many people in the fashion industry prefer very thin models so it's a case of supply and demand . The agents are simply supplying the fashion industry with the type of girls they want."

      "author": "Finn",

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "When the buck lies \u2013 or stops \u2013 with someone it means it's his or her responsibility, not someone else's. And agents who employed underweight models can face fines of up to 75,000 euros, or even prison sentences."
