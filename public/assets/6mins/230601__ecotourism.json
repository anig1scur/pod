  "intro": [
    "In recent years, nature and wildlife tourism has grown massively. Whether it\u2019s meeting mountain gorillas or swimming with dolphins, every year tourists pay thousands of dollars for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But ecotourism doesn't always work well. Beth and Neil discuss the topic and teach you related vocabulary."

The balance between the good and bad things ecotourism can bring is well understood by Vicky Smith, whose website, Earth Changes, matches ecotourists with environmentally-friendly travel companies. Here is Vicky talking with BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth."

      "author": "Vicky Smith",
      "text": "Just because tourism is nature-based, it doesn't mean to say it's necessarily responsible or sustainable . So, there's a lot of animal activities in tourism that we know which are, you know, highly irresponsible and unsustainable, like a performing whale and dolphin shows, or swimming with dolphins, elephant-riding, tiger selfies where the tigers are drugged."

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Genuine ecotourism is sustainable \u2013 designed to continue at a steady level which does not damage the environment. Not every travel company which calls themselves eco-friendly acts sustainably, and may still advertise irresponsible tourist activities, including tiger selfies \u2013 having your photo taken with a captive wild tiger."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "There are two requirements travel companies should meet to qualify as genuine ecotourism. First, tourists\u2019 main motivation should be to appreciate and observe the natural world without interfering, and second, the money they spend should support traditional communities. Clearly, having your photograph taken with a chained and drugged tiger does not meet these requirements."

      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "But not all companies claiming to be ecotourism behave so irresponsibly. According to Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent, who runs small scale wildlife expeditions to some of the most remote places on Earth, it\u2019s possible to put travel companies on a sliding scale from good to bad. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme, Costing the Earth, Antonia discussed her work in Tajikistan, a country where ecotourism is making a positive impact on both animal and human communities."

      "text": "At the other end of the scale is Tajikistan, where I work a lot, which gets less than two dozen wildlife tourists a year, and the money these visitors bring is essential to the conservation work that grassroots NGOs are doing. So those few tourists\u2026 their money goes a very long way and the animals people are looking at\u2026 snow leopards, rare mountain ungulates like Bukharan markhor, they are being observed from a distance, their behaviour is not being affected in any way, and the local communities are genuinely benefiting."

    {
      "author": "Beth",
      "text": "Antonia uses the phrase at the other end of the scale as a way of contrasting irresponsible tourist companies with what\u2019s happening in Tajikistan. There, animals including snow leopards and mountain ungulates, are being protected by ecotourist projects run by non-governmental organisations, or NGOs - organizations trying to achieve environmental or social aims outside of government control. These NGOs are grassroots organisations meaning that they are run from the bottom up, by ordinary people rather than leaders."
