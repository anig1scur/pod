      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So let's start with the term first impression \u2013 it's the idea or opinion you have about someone after meeting them for only a short time."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "So \u2013 Alexander Todorov has been researching our impressions. His tests asked people to decide whether they thought faces were dominant, competent, trustworthy or extroverted ."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Let's just look at those words for a second. Dominant means being strongest or most important. Competent means being able to do things."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "While if you're trustworthy it means people trust you \u2013 you are worth their trust. And being extroverted means you are energetic and enjoy spending time with others."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "So what did he find out? Faces that look happy and feminine \u2013 like a woman - were rated as more trustworthy ."

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "While faces that were more masculine \u2013 like a man \u2013 were seen as more dominant."

      "text": "Wider faces with big eyes were seen as more extroverted ."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Now the important thing that Todorov says is that these judgements aren't accurate. Someone who looks competent isn't necessarily competent!"

    {
      "author": "Professor Alexander Todorov, Princeton University",
      "text": "Trustworthiness , dominance and attractiveness are the three big things that we form impressions of people. But interestingly we have done some work predicting the electoral success of politicians, and the judgement that is most predictive of who is going to win the election is perceived competence. And this is not random at all, because if you ask voters what is the most important attribute of a politician, competence is the one on the top."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "OK, so this is actually quite significant. People say that the most important attribute \u2013 or quality \u2013 for a politician is competence \u2013 the ability to do things."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "That sounds fair enough. But because we make judgements based on appearance \u2013 this can actually affect how people vote."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "If voters believe \u2013 or perceive someone to be competent \u2013 they're more likely to vote for him or her."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "He says this applies especially to people who are less educated about politics \u2013 they are more likely to be influenced by appearance."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "He says this applies to around 25% of voters \u2013 so the number of people who go with their gut is large enough to influence the outcomes of elections!"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Wow. To go with your gut . That means to make a decision which isn't based on rational thought \u2013 it's based on instinct, on a feeling, on your gut."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 your gut is your stomach and the organs in your belly. So, can we tell nothing from a person's face?"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Todorov says faces carry useful information about things like a person's mental state, and whether they're tired or sick. But they don't tell you about a person's character."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Indeed. It's not only elections where this counts, we also judge during job interviews and meetings."

      "text": "Well, it's not such a bad idea! There's the example of the Boston Symphony Orchestra \u2013 back in the 1950s it was entirely made up of male musicians. They then introduced 'blind auditions' in other words they listened to new musicians without looking at them."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Well isn't that convenient, (and accurate?!), because those were exactly the two adjectives I wanted to look at next. Being trustworthy is important in life \u2013 it means people trust you\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "And being extroverted is more of a character type \u2013 extroverts like to be with people, and are often seen as confident \u2013 whereas the opposite \u2013 introverts, usually need to spend time on their own, and aren't as loud."
