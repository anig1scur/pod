That way I can wait till I get my official results and apply to university with those rather than getting predicted grades and then, you know, potentially being surprised and not being able to follow the path I wanted. I just always had in the back my mind that I'd spend a year doing something productive and something that would just be good fun. Tom: It's not something that I really knew about to be honest, I think, until I started university. It was a bit of an alien concept to me. It's something I've never thought about - it would have been far too expensive and it's not something that would have been able to rely on my parents or family members for."
