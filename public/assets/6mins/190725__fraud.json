This year, for example, thousands of people in the UK fell for a fraudulent \u2013 or fake \u2013 email, requesting that people update their direct debit details for paying their TV licence. That's a payment we have to make in the UK to fund the BBC."

It\u2019s a fraud that can be layered so you know we're getting some information from you.
