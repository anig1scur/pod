  "intro": [
    "In the early stories of Robin Hood there is no Maid Marian, no Friar Tuck, Robin doesn't live in the time of bad Prince John, or the crusades, doesn't lead a large and merry gang, and never robs the rich to give to the poor. Neil and Alice discuss the long-lasting appeal of this man with a bow and how he has changed over the centuries."

      "text": "Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York The Monk is, I think for most modern audiences who've either seen movies or read children's stories or whatever, quite disturbing in terms of its levels of violence. In terms of trying to make some comparisons with popular culture it seems to me that it's really at the level of Sopranos in terms of things like dismembered bodies and actual violence and assassinations."

    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Yes, I don\u2019t think you'd find it disturbing \u2013 disturbing means making you feel upset or shocked. Assassinations are the murder of important people, often for political reasons. And dismembered bodies are bodies that have been cut or torn into pieces."
