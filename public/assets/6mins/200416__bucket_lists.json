    "Have you always wanted to learn to dance the tango, do a magic trick, or skydive? If so, perhaps you need a bucket list \u2013 a list of all the things you want to do before you die. A list might sound great but they\u2019ve also been accused of limiting the imagination by encouraging people to follow someone else\u2019s idea of the perfect life. Neil and Sam discuss the subject and teach you some useful vocabulary."

      "text": "I\u2019m not really in favour of bucket lists. There are a couple of reasons. Most of all, you\u2019re kind of fooling yourself with a bucket list. We fear death, more than I think we fear anything else in our existence, because we can\u2019t predict it, and because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like because nobody comes back and tells us. And when you create a bucket list \u2013 something to do before you \u2018kick the bucket\u2019 ,the idea that you\u2019re giving yourself is that you can somehow control when and what death is going to be all about. We only make sense of our lives at the end of it. A bucket list takes you away from the chance to be spontaneous and I think it\u2019s so delicious to be able to say, \u2018that\u2019s an opportunity? \u2013 oh, I\u2019ll do that!\u2019"
