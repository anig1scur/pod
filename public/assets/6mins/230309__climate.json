But later, in college, Sarah became surrounded by people in her community who didn\u2019t share her love of the environment \u2013 people who didn\u2019t believe that climate change was real. And slowly, Sarah started to doubt it as well."

Now, Sarah works as a climate campaigner at the US National Centre for Science Education, teaching children the science behind climate change, but her journey there was a difficult one, and she lost many friends on the way."

Whatever climate deniers think, there is strong agreement on the issue among scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC. So, what percentage of the world\u2019s scientific community agree that climate change is real? Is it:"

      "author": "Marco Silva",
      "text": "It\u2019s quite important to make here a very clear distinction between being wrong, ill-informed about climate change and being a full-blown climate denier. A lot of people may not be very well versed with the science, the facts of climate change\u2026 to be honest, they can at times be quite complex, quite dense. Some people may have genuine questions about the subject. So, with information, with facts, those people can be convinced. Climate deniers , though, people who reject the basic facts of climate change, are likely to be more difficult to persuade."

      "text": "A number of researchers and academics have looked into exactly this topic before. Professor Sander van der Linden, professor of social psychology at the University of Cambridge, is one of them. He's been looking into this long and hard , and when I spoke to him, he gave me a couple of tips. For instance, don't challenge a climate denier directly. Don't confront them telling them that they're this or that, throwing insults at them, that their beliefs are wrong - that sort of attitude or strategy is only likely to backfire . If you do that, the chances are people are just going to hold on to their views even more firmly."

This approach is unlikely to work and will probably backfire , or have the opposite effect from that intended, such as making that person\u2019s opinion even stronger."

      "author": "Sam",
