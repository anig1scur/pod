You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days, that being an introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert. Introverts have many valuable qualities. They're reflective \u2013 that means thoughtful \u2013 and have inner resources . In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves."

      "text": "Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves. And who often have sort of a running dialogue in their head going on thinking before they're talking, like to have a little more time to think through things before they're commenting on them or answering a question, need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves, and enjoy having alone time."

Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people recharge their batteries \u2013 introverts tend to need time alone to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling drained \u2013 or very tired \u2013 whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with other people."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "Exactly. But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace, things can be made suitable for \u2013 extroverts. Extroverts typically love being with others \u2013 in a big class or an open plan office \u2013 where there's a lot going on. They enjoy the external stimulation. But introverts can find these big, noisy environments uncomfortable. Neil I can see that. And these days, people are wild about group work and brainstorming \u2013 job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team player \u2026 and so on."

      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "That's right. Introverts like to work alone or in small groups and need a quieter space to perform well. Let's listen now to Dr Peter Aloka, a researcher and psychologist in Kenya. He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo who are returning to school after having their babies. And schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning."

      "text": "Dr Peter Aloka, psychologist, Bondo, Kenya Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups, and they work in pairs with extroverts\u2026 The teachers should design a classroom for all the students too, to contribute. Whenever a teacher is teaching a question in class let them allow for wait time for students to process the information before answering the question. Just for people to think through that question. Thinking, pairing, and sharing: those three strategies will help the introverts to speak out."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Dr Peter Aloka is talking about some very clever pairing there. If you put two introverts together they might not say anything. An extrovert is likely to talk, but won't intimidate \u2013 or overpower \u2013 their introvert partner as much as a large group would."
    },
    {
      "author": "Alice",
      "text": "So the idea is that with fewer people \u2013 in a small group or a pair \u2013 the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas. And because their ideas have been thought through \u2013 or carefully considered \u2013 , their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for. So\u2026 Think. Pair. Share."

So thinking things through really works! \u2018Introvert' and \u2018extrovert' are the two basic personality types according to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies with their own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extrovert, whose interest lies with other people and the outside world."
