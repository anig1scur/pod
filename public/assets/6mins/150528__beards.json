Anyway, beards are such a talking point \u2013 a subject that a lot of people are discussing \u2013 that we decided to talk about them on today's programme! So are you ready for today's question, Neil? What's the name for someone who loves beards? Is it\u2026"

      "text": "Right. OK, well we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But this is interesting: a new scientific study suggests that the more beards there are in a population, the less attractive they become \u2013 and this currently gives clean-shaven men a competitive advantage."

      "author": "Neil",

You get a woman on the throne and men go, 'Oh, got to have a beard.' It's really strange. Or in the 60s or 70s with all the kind of, you know, big thing about women's lib, suddenly the beard becomes huge here."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Well, needless to say Lucinda doesn't have a beard, but she certainly knows a lot about them. She's the great great granddaughter of famous writer Charles Dickens, who sported \u2013 or wore \u2013 a very flamboyant beard. Flamboyant means eye-catching and different."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes. It's feminism . She also talks about women's lib , which is short for women's liberation. And this has a similar meaning to feminism. So, what do you think, Neil? Are beards a show of testosterone in reaction to powerful women? Is that why you've grown your beard?"

I mean I think when Jimmy and I\u2026 when I met Jimmy he told me about his 'beard season' melanoma charity and I was kind of on board from the get go."
