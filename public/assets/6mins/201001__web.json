    "In this programme, we\u2019ll hear about a new academic subject called Web Science, which studies the technology behind the internet. But from the human side, it\u2019s also interested in how people interact with each other online. So we\u2019ll be asking whether studying Web Science could make the internet better for humanity in the future. Neil and Sam talk about the subject and teach you vocabulary along the way."
