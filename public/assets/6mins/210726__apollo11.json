  "intro": [
    "Can you imagine being left in a capsule orbiting the Moon all by yourself, while your team mates go walk on the surface and become the first two humans to do so in history? That's what happened to the late Michael Collins in 1969. Neil and Georgina talk about the Apollo 11 astronaut, and teach you related vocabulary."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "That\u2019s right \u2013 And many people over the years have wondered whether he was disappointed not to have walked on the Moon. How would you feel if you went all that way and didn\u2019t stand on the Moon, Georgina?"

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Me personally \u2013 I\u2019d probably be pretty devastated \u2013 but I think it depends on personality. To be honest, I\u2019d probably be too scared to go to the Moon anyway."

    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Yes \u2013 and just think about being in a space module together \u2013 trapped for all those hours \u2013 it could create quite the sense of camaraderie \u2013 a friendship and trust formed by spending time together."

    {
      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Yes - I think one thing that has always interested me is the feeling of friendship, or as you said camaraderie, that must have developed between those three explorers. But, perhaps surprisingly, in an interview with the BBC programme Hard Talk, Collins said the close connection between the astronauts didn\u2019t develop until later."

      "author": "Michael Collins, astronaut",
      "text": "We formed some very strong bonds , but actually, not really during the flight of Apollo 11 or even during the preparatory flight of the flight. It was a round-the-world trip that we took after the flight. When I came to know Neil better. During our training, in the first place we had not been a backup as most primary crews had been, so we just got to know each other in the 6 months before the flight, which is a short period of time."

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Georgina",
      "text": "Six months sounds like a long time, but I suppose when preparing to become famous and go down in history , as they did - it doesn\u2019t leave much time for personal interactions."

      "text": "Yes \u2013 and he did say in the interview that he would have loved to walk on the Moon, but he was very proud to be a part of the team \u2013 as he was one of the trailblazers \u2013 a similar word to pioneer."

      "author": "Michael Collins, astronaut",
      "text": "Well, I\u2026 when I returned to Earth, I was amazed because most of the questions to me from the press centred on: You were the loneliest man in the whole lonely orbit around the lonely planet on a lonely evening. And I felt, on the other hand, quite comfortable in my happy little home inside the command module Columbia. I had been flying aeroplanes by myself for a number of years. So, the fact I was aloft by myself was not anything new."
