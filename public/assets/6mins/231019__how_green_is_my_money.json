One of the most effective things to do is be smart about investing your money, so according to the campaign, Make My Money Matter, which of the following is the best way to fight climate change?

Concerns about how banks invest our money led to the UK\u2019s first environmentally sustainable bank, Triodos, which opened in Bristol in 2012. John Fleetwood, who has worked in sustainable investing for decades, thinks public interest in ethical banks has ballooned in the last few years, as he told BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth:"

That\u2019s now broadened hugely, and there\u2019s great concern about greenwashing so who\u2019s jumping on the bandwagon ? - that\u2019s a huge concern amongst investors. So, what I\u2019m doing is to tackle that and actually to say, okay, which are the funds that are actually making a positive social and environmental impact?"

But as environmentally responsible investing increased, banks started jumping on the bandwagon , an idiom meaning to become involved in an activity because it\u2019s popular, and not because you\u2019re really interested in it."

This idea inspired British film director, Richard Curtis, to start his campaign, Make My Money Matter. On TV, Richard has raised millions of pounds for the BBC\u2019s charity, Comic Relief, but even he was surprised by the amount of money saved by doing one simple thing, moving your pension to an environmentally sustainable fund. And as Richard told BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth, he was even encouraged by former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney:"
