      "author": "Dan",

They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it's a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain."

Our first word was alleged . If something is alleged it is 'said or believed be true but not proven to be true'. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?"
