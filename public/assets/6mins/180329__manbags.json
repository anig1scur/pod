    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "OK, you've made that very clear! We'll find out the answer at the end of the programme anyway. Now let's talk more about manbags. For hundreds of years women have carried their possessions around in handbags, so why can't a man do the same with a manbag?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Maybe it's the name. Why can't it just be a bag? Why does a bag have to have a gender?"

    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "It's a trend Neil \u2013 a stylish fashion item designed to look good on men. Many big names have flocked to adopt the trend. Pharrell Williams, David Beckham and Kanye West, are just some of those who've been spotted rocking a manbag. Rocking is an informal way of saying 'wearing'."

      "text": "No, they're practical too. We've always needed bags to carry stuff around but what we carry these days has changed \u2013 you know laptops, mobiles, even our lunch \u2013 so why not have a trendy looking bag to carry these things around in?"

    {
      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Neil",

And if you really want to be on trend you could also splash out on a 'murse' that's a man's purse, or a 'mote' \u2013 a man's tote bag? Have I convinced you?"
