    "What is the chance of the human race surviving the 21st century? There are many dangers \u2013 climate change for example, or nuclear war, or a pandemic, or planet Earth being hit by a giant asteroid. Sam and Neil discuss our future and whether we need to start panicking but not before they teach you some useful vocabulary."
