    "For centuries, people have known that human blood is a remarkable substance. But they never really knew just how complex it was. Modern science is now showing us all the amazing things it does. Rob and Finn talk about how detailed research into blood's properties has given us all sorts of new ways to heal our bodies and improve the quality of our lives."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Yes, Finn, but there's all sorts of other amazing things that blood can do. If we are running at altitude \u2013 high up - the limbs get tired because there's not enough oxygen. The blood then starts creating new red cells and pours them into the system. That's why athletes often train in the mountains."

      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "Altitude training, isn't it? And, apparently, the different types of food you eat have an immediate effect on your blood, or rather the element of blood called plasma. So, if you eat a cholesterol-high breakfast, for example, very soon after that you can see the fat in the blood."
    },
    {
      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "Nice. Ideas about how blood moves around your body have changed a lot over the years too. The Romans thought blood flowed one way and came out of our feet and hands and was then burnt away. But William Harvey in the 17thcentury found that blood circulated via veins and arteries \u2013 these are the tubes in our body where blood is carried around."

      "author": "Finn",
      "text": "And let's not forget clotting \u2013 that's when the blood hardens. If our blood didn't clot when we cut ourselves we'd be dead within minutes. It is really fascinating isn't it? And we're just beginning to understand stem cells . These are also in the blood and are used to repair various organs in the body"
