Dr Christopher Lowry from the University of Colorado conducted an experiment to test whether soil gives us a natural high \u2013 meaning to make us happy without taking drugs. He injected a bacterium commonly found in soil into mice to see what effect this would have on them. Let's hear what he said in this BBC programme."

HM: After injecting the mice with the bacterium Dr Lowry placed them in a cup of water. CL: These mice that had been injected with bacterium swam during a 6-minute test for a longer period of time than animals that just got a placebo."

    {
      "author": "Sophie",
      "text": "So the bacterium had a similar effect on the mice as an antidepressant drug might. When we dig in soil we ingest \u2013 or absorb \u2013 the bacterium through our lungs or cuts in our skin. A placebo , by the way, is a substance with no physical effects that is used when testing a drug. So here one group of mice were injected with the bacterium and another group were injected with the placebo. And since the mice seemed happier when treated with soil bacteria, there's a good chance we would too."
