So that's for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don't want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age . It's never been easier to be vegan."

      "author": "Neil",

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "Others go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing livestock \u2013 that means animals like cows and pigs \u2013 produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let's just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose veganism \u2026"
