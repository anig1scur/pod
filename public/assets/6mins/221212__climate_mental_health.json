The 2021 UK census reported that three quarters of adults in Britain are worried about the impact of climate change, and it\u2019s a worry that\u2019s shared by the young. According to a survey by Greenpeace, what percentage of young people worldwide say they feel worried about climate change? Is it:"

      "text": "OK, Sam, we\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the correct answer later in the programme. The expert I mentioned earlier who\u2019s investigating this problem is Dr Gesche Huebner, senior researcher at University College London. Here Dr Huebner explains to BBC World Service programme, The Climate Question, what she\u2019s been finding out."

We also have pretty good evidence that, for example, experiencing a natural disaster - storms, flooding - are linked to negative mental health outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder or other anxiety issues."

If we change our road infrastructure to enable more walking and cycling, again we have fewer\u2026  fossil fuel being burned but also, we know that walking and cycling are very good for mental health. If we can change our road layout and create more urban greenspaces, we already know that green and blue spaces are good for mental health."

With creative thinking like this, it may still be possible for today\u2019s young people to have a planet worth living for. Speaking of which, Sam, it\u2019s time to reveal the answer to my question."

It\u2019s a high percentage which is not surprising considering that it\u2019s future generations who will live with the consequences of what we do, or fail to do, today. OK, let\u2019s recap the vocabulary we\u2019ve learned from this programme about climate anxiety \u2013 feelings of distress caused by worrying about climate change."
