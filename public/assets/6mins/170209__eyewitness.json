But let's talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn't work like that. It's a reconstructive process."

      "text": "Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College, University of London From all those TV dramas you've watched you'll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don't introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don't distort their memory."

      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "That's right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means 'made impure through contact with an outside source'. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can't get back to the original information."
    },
    {
      "author": "Neil",

    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "And it isn't only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you're being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker's face. And at knifepoint means 'under threat of being stabbed'."

Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further."

      "text": "Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York First, I think it's sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It's very disconcerting to think that we're going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be - and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it."
