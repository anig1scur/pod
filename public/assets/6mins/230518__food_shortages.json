    "Do you know where the food you buy in the supermarket comes from? Will it always be available? With changes in the world economy, inflation, and the effects of climate change, is there a risk of recurring food shortages in many parts of the world? Rob and Neil talk about it and teach you vocabulary along the way."

Some see these food supply problems, which were caused by unusually cold weather combined with rising energy prices, as a warning not to take a reliable supply for food for granted."

But with changes in the world economy, inflation, and the effects of climate change, how much longer will this continue? In this programme, we\u2019ll be finding out, and as usual, learning some useful, new vocabulary as well."

      "author": "Rob",
      "text": "OK. I\u2019ll reveal the answer later on. Besides difficulties in importing food, some countries are also producing less food than they used to. In the UK, many farmers are selling their apple orchards to housing developers rather than struggle with increasing production costs. Here\u2019s Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, speaking with BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."

And when you think about how much investment there has been in glasshouses and polytunnels since 1985 in a way that's transformed UK supply, quite frankly, the fact that this is what's being forecast is extraordinary."

A glasshouse is a large greenhouse \u2013 a building with glass sides used for the commercial growing of fruit and vegetables. A polytunnel is a similar structure but made using plastic instead of glass."

      "text": "However, it\u2019s not only Brits who are worrying about the production and supply of their food - changes are happening all around the world. When global demand for food outgrows supply, countries start competing with each other. According to Oxford University\u2019s, Professor Charles Godfrey, an expert on the global food system, we\u2019re now living in a less connected, less collaborative world, a world which he says is \u2018de-globalising\u2019."

While this sounds positive, Professor Godfrey is worried that deglobalisation makes it harder to supply food to parts of the world which cannot produce enough for themselves. Here, he shares his concerns with BBC Radio 4\u2019s, The Food Programme."

      "text": "We think that in the next 30 or 40 years we will probably see global demand for food rising 30 to 50 percent, and I think a question is: should the UK be stepping up to help meet that demand, given that we have a very sophisticated home agriculture\u2026 or you could argue completely the opposite, that we live in a country where we are very depauperate for biodiversity - perhaps we should produce less food here and use our land more for biodiversity. My view is that if we plan our land use in a canny way, one can produce more food, and one can increase the biodiversity in the country."
