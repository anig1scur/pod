    "Some dishes have the taste of our childhood. Cooking is not only about nutrition, but also about culture. But some traditional recipes are being lost. We talk about one woman\u2019s quest to preserve the food culture of her native Ghana in west Africa, and teach you related vocabulary along the way."

    "Bangers and mash is a classic British dish. It\u2019s easy to understand why mashed potato is called \u2018mash\u2019 - but how did sausages come to be known as \u2018bangers\u2019?",
    "a) because \u2018bang\u2019 is an old-fashioned word for pork",
    "b) because sausage-making machines used to make a banging noise",
    "c) because sausages would explode in the frying pan, going \u2018bang\u2019",

Many traditional spices and ingredients were no longer being used, and it was more common to see tomato ketchup than Ghanaian chipotle sauce."
