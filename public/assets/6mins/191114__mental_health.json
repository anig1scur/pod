If someone has an injury, like a broken leg or a serious medical issue, it\u2019s obvious, and we can understand what\u2019s happening. With mental health issues, though, there\u2019s no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties maybe don\u2019t get the same understanding as people who have medical problems."

Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them, and they also have an impact on businesses. Paul Farmer is head of the mental health awareness charity Mind. He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily programme about this. How much does he says it costs businesses in the UK?"

So that\u2019s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals. Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of talented, able, contributors who often just slide away from the workplace because they don\u2019t get the right help and support for their mental health."
