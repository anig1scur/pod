Neil Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London \u2013 something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone."

      "text": "Well, that's a good question, Neil, and maybe we'll find some answers in the show, because today we're talking about why cities make us so rude. And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what's the name of this chemical? Is it\u2026 a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin?"

But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called 'Talk to me London' has created these 'Tubechat' badges that you can wear to show that you're happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one! Neil Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don't know what might happen."

      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us \u2013 we're just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We're persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It's a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we're going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Dr Elle Boag there. And hyper vigilance means being extremely watchful of what's going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you're just one person in a crowd of others and you just don't know who might be dangerous. Neil Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour."
    },
    {
      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "That's right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become insular \u2013 which means inward looking."

      "author": "Catherine",
      "text": "Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic \u2013 which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can't do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours."

And it's not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting \u2013 it's about efficiency \u2013 getting to work on time, getting things done. Let's hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this."

      "author": "INSERT",
      "text": "Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it's a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don't have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it's not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose \u2013 it's simply that people have a destination to be."
