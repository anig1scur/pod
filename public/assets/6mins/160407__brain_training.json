And that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts of our brain. Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to resisting some kind of damage from the stroke."

      "text": "So when a bilingual speaker switches \u2013 or changes \u2013 from one language to another \u2013 this exercises the executive parts of their brain, making it stronger and fitter. And because the brain is stronger, it's able to resist \u2013 or prevent \u2013 damage caused by a stroke."

If you're right handed, doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand will stimulate your brain \u2013 or getting dressed in the dark with your eyes shut. Or simply memorizing a list of words, for example your shopping list."

According to research, chocolate may enhance \u2013 or improve \u2013 cognitive performance, and that is your ability to acquire and utilize knowledge.
