INSERT Jenny Landreth, swimming specialist, interviewed by the BBC Jenny Landreth: I'm very keen on my wetiquette in the pool. Interviewer: It's that thing where people can get quite cross about, which is: Do you go around clockwise or anticlockwise? Do you overtake or not? Jenny Landreth: People need a rule. We need to observe the rules of the pool and I'm very keen on that. Most other swimmers will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool. And don\u2019t know how to observe the rules of that lane. Interviewer: Lane rage \u2013 you mean if you\u2019re a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast lane? Jenny Landreth: Well, I hate to say it, but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed and think they\u2019re slightly faster than they are. Interviewer: Ah! The male ego here! Jenny Landreth: They quite often don\u2019t like it if there\u2019s a woman swimming faster than them. So very often they\u2019ll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetiquette to get in the correct lane. Interviewer: Know your speed. Jenny Landreth: Yes."
