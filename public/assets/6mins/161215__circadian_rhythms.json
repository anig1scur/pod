We rely on the predictable cycle of light or dark in a 24-hour period to synchronise \u2013 or adjust \u2013 our body clocks to the environment \u2013 and if we mess about with the light and dark cycle by flying into a new time zone, it makes us feel really bad!"

So there isn't anything wrong with the clock but the clock ticks and oscillates at its own endogenous period just the same as if I were to put you in a dark cave. Your biological internal clock would oscillate at your endogenous circadian period."

      "author": "Neil",
      "text": "But their clocks are free-running \u2013 they don't get cues from the outside environment telling them when to wake up, when to eat, when to feel sleepy.
