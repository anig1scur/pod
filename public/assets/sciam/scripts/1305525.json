They are Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, Sora, Grasshopper Sparrows, Blackpoll Warblers, Long-billed Curlews. Some of them are flying just a few hundred miles. Some are nearly circumnavigating the globe. So how, given that it\u2019s dark and given that they are flying anywhere from 15 to about 55 miles per hour over your sleeping head, would anyone ever be able not only to count them but also to know which bird species just zoomed past?"

It\u2019s hard enough to learn bird IDs when the songs you\u2019re listening to are a couple of seconds long or more. Let\u2019s play a bit of a game. I\u2019m going to play a few daytime bird songs and let you try to listen and ID them\u2014if you\u2019ve done this before. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ll hear a couple of cool songs that are pretty common in, say, the continental U.S. And then you might be able to recognize them when you do hear them from now on.

We\u2019re talking about pushing the limits of our hearing and processing capabilities. Okay, so back to Joe: He was up and recording birds at night from the roof of his house. But nighttime bird speak was a new language to him. He wasn\u2019t fluent\u2014yet. But he also decided that his ears weren\u2019t enough. So he turned to specialized computer software to transform the sounds he was hearing into images called spectrograms. A spectrogram is like a visual voiceprint of whatever made the sound."

And so you get a picture of the call note. So looking at the spectrogram and being able to zoom in close on the really short ones makes a huge difference for the ability to identify."

      "text": "The spectrograms froze the nighttime bird calls in time. Soon they began to take on familiar shapes. Joe likens the calls he saw on the spectrograms to notes on sheet music. He recognized shapes he was seeing over and over in the spectrograms, but he couldn\u2019t make sense of them. Joe could hear and appreciate the music, but he couldn\u2019t separate the avian \u201cinstruments,\u201d so to speak. So he turned to another tool: the collective wisdom of the surveillance network."

Of course, the problem is eventually spring migration kicks into high gear, and then you have 20,000 chirps, and you have to stop for every one and look at it carefully. Maybe zoom in a little bit, maybe listen, and you start to find way more cool stuff, but if it\u2019s a busy night, it just depends how busy is busy. It could take you three, four hours."

But they have really declined massively in the East, and it was the first record in the county for over a decade. So I was just like, wow, this is so amazing, so easy.

      "text": "There\u2019s a lot of open questions about how birds at night use the landscape that we simply just can\u2019t answer from having 10 people recording. To be able to get conservation implications, we need a large enough sample size that it\u2019s not just random, down to one weird night or one big night, versus one low night at one count location can make it seem like one species was way more abundant this year or way less abundant. But when we have regular birders all across the country, thousands of us, recording every night, we\u2019re gonna be able to start getting a representative sample of the population of birds in flight on the northbound migration, on the southbound migration, year after year. If we can just get the people who are just at their house, for a very low electricity burden, we can monitor really accurately for vocal nocturnal migrants. Just having a bigger array of many, many people monitoring, I think it\u2019s gonna be a big help. [CLIP: Theme music]"
