      "text": "This is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. I\u2019m Shayla Love. Tell me if this sounds familiar. You\u2019re trying to get some work done, and you find yourself continually picking up your cell phone. In frustration, you might slam the phone down beside you and swear to leave it alone\u2014theoretically allowing you to focus on what you\u2019re doing. Right now my phone is sitting next to me untouched. But have I really protected myself from its distractions or its ability to impact my mind? The answer is no, according to a well-known study in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research from 2017 entitled \u201cBrain Drain: The Mere Presence of One\u2019s Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity.\u201d Cognitive and social psychologist Adrian Ward and his colleagues proposed the \u201cbrain drain hypothesis\u201d by showing that just having a phone next to you could impact cognition\u2014specifically, working memory, or the mental system that helps us hold information about what we\u2019re currently doing at a given moment."

      "text": ": This was an intriguing, though slightly concerning, finding that triggered more studies on how the presence of our smartphones might be influencing how well we\u2019re able to think. But in a new meta-analysis that looked at data from 27 different brain drain studies, the story of the brain drain hypothesis has gotten a little more complicated."

      "text": "If it\u2019s just sitting next to you while you\u2019re working, is that a problem or not? And I think that\u2019s quite an important question to answer, to know more about."

      "text": ": That\u2019s Doug Parry, a lecturer at Stellenbosch University, who studies socioinformatics and who did the meta-analysis\u2014a study in which data from multiple published papers are combined together and reanalyzed. Parry became interested in brain drain first from studying multitasking and then from investigating something called \u201conline vigilance\u2026\u201d\u00a0"

We\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re ruminating about, you know, the news cycle, the\u2014ourfriends and family that we can connect to through our\u2014through our phone, and so on."

Is it a consistent effect?\u201d"

      "author": "Love: ",
      "text": "Past studies on brain drain looked primarily at five cognitive functions: working memory, sustained attention, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and fluid intelligence. Parry lumped together data for each of these functions individually and then did a sixth analysis where he looked at all the results together. In the end, he looked at 56 effect sizes on how phones affect our minds from 27 studies in 25 publications."
    },
    {
      "author": "Parry: ",
      "text": "So looking at the five separate analyses\u2013of the five, the only statistically significant result was for working memory."
    },
    {
      "author": "Parry",
      "text": ": Whereas for the other four cognitive functions, no statistically significant effects of the presence of a smartphone were found across the various effects included in those analyses. And that is somewhat consistent with Ward and colleagues. So they found anegative effect for working memory, but they didn\u2019t find a negative effect for sustained attention."
    },
    {
      "author": "Love",
      "text": ": Though it is similar to what Ward found, Parry\u2019s analysis also revealed the impact on working memory was much smaller than initial studies indicated."

    {
      "author": "Parry",
      "text": ": I think the important difference here with this meta-analysis, compared to the Ward 2017 paper, is the magnitude of the effect."

      "author": "Love: ",
      "text": "This matters because it can tell us whether our phones are completely diverting our attention by their mere presence or simply affecting one aspect of our cognition slightly."

    {
      "author": "Parry: ",
      "text": "A massive, massive effect: we would all be distracted all the time. And a very, very tiny effect: it would be meaningless. And this is somewhere in between. But it is a smaller effect than the earlier research has shown."

    {
      "author": "Love",
      "text": ": Parry\u2019s meta-analysis is a preprint, which means that it hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed yet. When I talked to Ward about that paper\u2019s findings, he said he was glad there\u2019s now been enough work on brain drain to look at evidence combined together and that, overall, Parry\u2019s work reinforces the notion that phones are interfering with our working memory over other cognitive functions such as sustained attention\u2014or what you\u2019re paying attention to consciously."
    },
    {
      "author": "Ward",
      "text": ": When you\u2019re doing great at sustained attention, you know, you\u2019re thinking you\u2019re doing awesome because you\u2019re not looking at your phone. It\u2019s on the desk in front of you, but you\u2019re not paying attention to it, right? And so that\u2019s showing us no difference in sustained attention. But that process of not paying attention to it is using some of your working memory capacity. So that shows up as that significant, significant negative effect on working memory capacity."

    {
      "author": "Love: ",
      "text": "Parry thinks that his findings actually raise more questions for further study, such as whether there\u2019s something about the individuals in the past studies that led to a stronger\u00a0 brain drain effect for certain cognitive effects. For instance, for some people, their phones might be more important to them."

      "author": "Love: ",
      "text": "Another factor could be how susceptible a person is to FOMO, or the fear of missing out. There is an official psychologically validated scale for FOMO from 2013 that Parry says could be used alongside measuring brain drain to see if that influences the effect."
    },
    {
      "author": "Ward: ",
      "text": "The reality is like, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of our phones. They\u2019re going to be around, and [we\u2019re] probably going to become even more dependent on them over time.\u201d Like, I just had a kid, and I track every time this kid has a diaper on my phone, right? Like, my whole life is recorded in this little device. They are just woven into every aspect of our lives."
    },
    {
      "author": "Love",
      "text": ": Knowing that the presence of a phone influences working memory could lead to having more targeted technology harm reduction, or keeping an eye out for that specific effect. In the end, this meta-analysis indicates we might not have to be super distressed about what a phone in our vicinity is doing to us. For some people, there still could be a significant brain drain, but for others, it could be more of a drip. Thanks for listening! For 60-Second Science, I\u2019m Shayla Love."
