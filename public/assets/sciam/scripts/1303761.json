This award celebrates those who significantly improve access to cancer care for underserved populations. In 2021, Tomma Hargraves received the award for her work as a volunteer for the Lung Cancer Initiative of North Carolina. She developed their Access to Care Gas Card program, which helps patients travel to their treatment. As we prepared for this year\u2019s awards, we reconnected with Tomma to learn more about what\u2019s happened since she received the award."},{"author":"Megan Hall","text":"Well Tomma Hargraves, it\u2019s such a pleasure to get a chance to talk with you and catch up on everything you\u2019ve been doing over the past year."},{"author":"Tomma Hargraves","text":"Thank you. Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Hall","text":"So for people who don\u2019t know your story, do you mind briefly talking about your personal cancer journey?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Sure. It\u2019s a 15-year cancer journey and I was diagnosed in 2006 with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. I participated in a very aggressive clinical trial for nine months and it was initially successful. I did go out of remission three years later, had a little more treatment, had a craniotomy along the way. And 15 years later, I now am so educated about lung cancer."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"I know that I have a mutation that I didn\u2019t know when I was diagnosed and I believe that I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m supposed to share my journey, so other people can have the same experience I\u2019ve had."},{"author":"Hall","text":"They said your survival rate at one point was maybe 15%?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Correct. I think we\u2019re up to 21 now."},{"author":"Hall","text":"Unlike a lot of people who say they don\u2019t want cancer to define them, you said that cancer does define you. What do you mean by that?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"When I looked at the statistics and when I learnt about lung cancer, and then I found out that it was the least funded of all cancers, but it\u2019s the number one cancer killer. And that more women are getting lung cancer, now, I thought, as long as I\u2019m a survivor of this, I need to do something with this to help our cause. So everything just kind of fell into place here, having an organization right here in Raleigh and being very close to and working, volunteering at my hospital."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"And I just felt that I needed to give back and I needed to do something to help support more lung cancer research and lung cancer patients as well. So that\u2019s just part of who I am."},{"author":"Hall","text":"You were behind creating a gas card for cancer patients to get to their treatments. Where did that idea come from?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Well, by then I was on the board of directors for the Lung Cancer Initiative. And quite honestly, and selfishly, I had raised a lot of money for them with the fundraising and our 5Ks and all that. And we were funding wonderful research and young investigators and all of these things, but I finally brought it up at the meeting. I said, \u201cWhat are we doing directly for patients?\u201d And we really hadn\u2019t been doing anything at that point directly."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"After volunteering at the hospital, and now of course with the gas prices so high, I thought, what about gas cards for our patients? And they were very willing to fund that program. And so it really was my idea, but without the Lung Cancer Initiative, it probably would\u2019ve never happened, because they implemented it. The requests for the gas cards go into them and they send it directly out to the patients from all different cancer centers. So it may seem like a small thing to some people, but it\u2019s a big thing to patients."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"And like my oncologist said, if they can\u2019t get to treatment, we can\u2019t help them."},{"author":"Hall","text":"Do you have any sense of how many people have been helped by this gas card program?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"I think the last statistic that I heard from our president Amy was over 2,500 people. You know, they budget it, so I think they\u2019re going to try to do another 500 this year. It\u2019s probably closer to 3,000 now, but to me that\u2019s significant. We still have to get the word out in the state, because a lot of people still don\u2019t know about our organization. We try really hard, but they don\u2019t know about LCI. So we\u2019re working on it."},{"author":"Hall","text":"For some of us who live in cities, the nearest hospital is just a quick ride away. Why are these gas cards so important where you are?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Well, there\u2019s a lot of rural areas in North Carolina. So these people may get diagnosed by their primary care doctor and then get referred to the cancer centers. Now it\u2019s really important that we get these people in so they can participate in clinical trials. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get better with our lung cancer treatment. So it\u2019s really important."},{"author":"Hall","text":"How far do some patients have to travel to get to their care?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"You know, a lot of people come from the mountains, which is probably three hours away. We have other people who come up from Wilmington or the beach areas and that can be three or four hours as well."},{"author":"Hall","text":"Can you tell me about a specific person who was affected by this program? Who benefited from the gas cards?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"It\u2019s interesting because a lot of times, I don\u2019t know actually who applies for the cards. The nurse navigators, like the one that I work with at UNC, she\u2019ll fill out the application and just send them in. Sometimes now with the work that I do at the hospital, I\u2019ll actually go in and talk to the patients. I\u2019m not a medical advisor, I\u2019m more of an emotional support, but one of the things I\u2019ll ask them is could you use a gas card? And of course, most of them say yes."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"I met one this past week when I was volunteering at UNC. And when I walked into the room, he said, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve talked before and you got me that gas card.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I told you about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, could you use another one?\u201d He goes, \u201cYeah, we could.\u201d The sign to me was this man was still surviving with lung cancer. And I had known him a year now. So that was exciting. And he was so enthused about it and happy about it. So it was a good thing."},{"author":"Hall","text":"What did it mean for you to be nominated and then win the Catalyst for Change Award?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"I was totally shocked. And you may have heard the story. I kept getting emails from the C2 people."},{"author":"Hall","text":"The Cancer Community people?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Yes. And I thought it was junk mail, so I was just deleting it. And finally I got an email and it said, I need to check and see if you\u2019re getting these emails. And I\u2019m like, well, what is this? Well, I didn't know that the Lung Cancer Initiative had nominated me for it. They never told me. So I went, yes, I\u2019m getting them. And he says, okay, great. And so then I actually got in touch with the folks at LCI and I said, did you nominate me for something?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"And they started laughing and they said, well, yeah, but we didn\u2019t know this was going to happen so fast. I was honored of course, but I thought, oh, I\u2019ll never win this. There\u2019s so many other wonderful things going on. And then they told me that I was a finalist, and then I won the award and I was like, oh my gosh."},{"author":"Hall","text":"What was the reaction among the people that you work with at the Lung Cancer Initiative when you won this award?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"They were so thrilled. They all just love me now."},{"author":"Hall","text":"How has this award impacted your work?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Oh, well it impacted it quite a bit, but I think the one thing that has come out of it is that it has been put out there publicly. And so I was asked to speak at different organizations about LCI and bring the word out about lung cancer on a local level. I think this is the first podcast I\u2019ve done, but I\u2019ve done a couple of other things, interviews. You know there are a lot of wonderful people out there with great stories."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Mine\u2019s just one of many but, nothing else, if it brings more of a vision for our program and for other people to get enthused about something as awful as lung cancer, it\u2019s kept me busy."},{"author":"Hall","text":"I understand that you\u2019re now a judge. So without telling us too much, what has struck you about the nominees this year?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Yeah, the judging, it\u2019s hard because every single one of them to me offered great resources or did wonderful things. I mean, I really had a hard time because everybody was deserving. They really were."},{"author":"Hall","text":"Just sort of reflecting on your own cancer journey and all the interactions you\u2019ve had with other patients. What would you say to someone else who is going through a similar journey? Is there any advice or counsel you would offer?"},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened with me is being able to do what I\u2019m doing at the hospital. And I go into a room and my nurse navigator will say, \u201cThere\u2019s someone else in this room who\u2019s had lung cancer.\u201d And they\u2019re looking around because I mean, look at me, I look pretty healthy. And so she\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, she did.\u201d And their eyes get really big. And then I\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, 15 years ago.\u201d And then their eyes get really big."},{"author":"Hargraves","text":"And so I always say to them, you can never give up hope because somebody\u2019s got to be in that 20% survival rate and it might as well be you. So that\u2019s what we try to encourage. It\u2019s hard though. It can be very, very depressing. And I remember having some major pity parties through treatment. It\u2019s hard to be positive when it\u2019s not a really well-funded or well-understood cancer. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards."},{"author":"Hall","text":"Tomma Hargraves, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today.
