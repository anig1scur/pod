That\u2019s it. For decades researchers have been working to expand those choices, but progress has been slow."},{"author":"","text":"Now a new pill for men has just passed its first safety trial in humans. What\u2019s particularly exciting about this daily pill, which works by blocking a key step in sperm production, is that it\u2019s hormone-free."},{"author":"","text":"Here to tell us more about the latest progress on male contraception is Hannah Seo, a freelance science journalist based in Brooklyn."},{"author":"","text":"Hannah, thanks so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Hannah Seo","text":"Thanks for having me. It\u2019s exciting."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you recently wrote a story for Scientific American about some advances in male birth control. Could you start by just telling us what this particular method is and, and how it works?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"Yeah, I was really fascinated to read about this trial because it\u2019s the first nonhormonal male birth control pill. So a lot of the birth control methods that we think about usually involve hormones of some kind or involve some sort of surgery, right, like a vasectomy. But this does neither of those things. It is a pill that\u2019s supposed to be taken daily, and it just kind of stops sperm production from happening through nonhormonal methods, so I thought this was a really innovative piece of medicine that is being\u2014in development right now."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Could you tell us more about the mechanism by which it prevents sperm production?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"Yes, absolutely. So one thing that\u2019s interesting to note is that in people of all sexes, if you have a severe vitamin A deficiency, that can really impact your fertility, and so the makers of this drug were really focused on this detail. And what they found out is that cells in the testes will take up vitamin A, metabolize vitamin A into this metabolite called retinoic acid; retinoic acid will bind to a receptor, and in that binding it\u2019ll drive changes in gene expression that leads to sperm production\u2014there\u2019s, like, a cascade of effects, and the consequence is that you get sperm."},{"author":"","text":"And so what this drug does is it prevents that binding from happening ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Seo","text":"It prevents retinoic acid from binding to its receptor. And as a consequence it sort of breaks the chain, and, you know, all the various effects can\u2019t really cascade the way they would\u2014normally would, and you prevent sperm production that way. And then once you\u2019ve stopped taking the drug, after a while, you eventually regain that function."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Just, you know, remind us: Where are we at with male birth control in general right now? You know, what\u2019s available, what\u2019s in the works?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"Yeah, right now what people can currently get include just two things: you can get a vasectomy, or you can use condoms. And so, as far as male contraception goes, those are really the only two options, and neither one of those is particularly ideal, especially if you\u2019re someone who wants a reversible option to control your fertility."},{"author":"","text":"At the moment there are several options in development, including this pill, which is a nonhormonal birth control pill taken daily. There\u2019s also a gel\u2014I think a lot of people will have heard of this gel. It\u2019s called Nest/T, which stands for a progestin called Nestorone, as well as testosterone. People who are doing hormone-replacement therapy will use a similar gel on their shoulders. It\u2019s a very, very similar mechanism. And this works a little bit similarly to the nonhormonal pill in that it stops sperm production reversibly. So that is probably the male contraceptive that is furthest along in development. That is currently on the cusp of starting phase 3 clinical trials."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s also a reversible vasectomy. Some vasectomies, currently, surgically are reversible but not all of them, and this, quote, unquote, \u201creversible vasectomy\u201d is really an implant. And what it is, is that it\u2019s a tiny, little hydrogel that can be inserted into the vas deferens, and it just physically blocks sperm from being able to escape into the ejaculate. And so that is also pretty far along in development."},{"author":"","text":"And those are really the two that are kind of closest to becoming released onto the market. Besides those two we then have this nonhormonal contraceptive pill that stops sperm production and, like, a few other smaller options that are also kind of in early, early development."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so speaking of which: Where in development is this pill? I know there [was] some recent news about progress, but where does that leave us?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"So this pill currently just finished a clinical 1a trial, and what that means is that it has not been tested for efficacy yet; it has only been tested for safety. So in this trial\u2014and it was pretty small trial; it only involved, you know, like, a dozen healthy men\u2014in, in this small trial what was essentially being tested was how well people reacted to the pill ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Seo","text":"And whether or not levels of this drug stayed in the blood for, like, an adequate period of time."},{"author":"","text":"And so this new development is exciting because it means that this pill is safe to take at the levels that we expect this pill might be taken if it goes to market, but we still don\u2019t really have data on how [effectively] it can reduce the sperm that people\u2019s bodies produce."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and were there any side effects or, you know, anything that came up during the trial?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"So it looks really good so far. I will say that this trial was quite small, only 16 men, and it also didn\u2019t involve taking this drug for a long, long [period] of time. And so even though there were no side effects noted in the trial that they completed, we still have a long way to go to know whether or not anybody will have side effects once they start using it daily for months or years."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what are the next steps for this drug?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"Yeah, so the next step for this drug is that they are now undergoing a clinical 1b trial and a clinical 2a trial, and what that means is that these will be larger trials involving more people taking this drug for, you know, more doses at a time and assessing not only safety but also efficacy. So they\u2019ll start to measure sperm counts and see whether or not sperm production reduces over time and, if so, by how much and how different doses of the drug affects that efficacy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. And what\u2019s the timeline like to get from where this drug is now to actually reaching the market?"},{"author":"Seo","text":"That is a great question and [laughs] one that I think is not entirely predictable, for a number of reasons. You know, obviously, to get this drug to market it involves, you know, the [Food and Drug Administration] and, like, government regulators, and sometimes that can be, you know, not so predictable."},{"author":"","text":"I did talk to someone who was involved in running this trial, and she said that she hoped that this drug would come to market within the next few years\u2014like, fewer than five years. And I do think it\u2019s possible, provided that the next trials go smoothly, that no major side effects are reported and that the government assesses the safety and etcetera in a timely manner\u2014I think that\u2019s maybe an unpredictable part."},{"author":"","text":"But I do think that there is a demand for more contraceptive options, especially more male contraceptive options, and I think just the public sense of wanting various options to control that agency will contribute to, you know, these methods being available soon and pressure to, like, push these through and, and have them available on the market."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to talk us through this story, Hannah."},{"author":"Seo","text":"Great. It was a pleasure to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode. We\u2019ll be back on Friday for a look at the adventurous field known as experimental archaeology."},{"author":"","text":"Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper and Jeff DelViscio.

It is a pill that\u2019s supposed to be taken daily, and it just kind of stops sperm production from happening through nonhormonal methods, so I thought this was a really innovative piece of medicine that is being\u2014in development right now."]},{"begin":"189.000","end":"193.160","lines":["Could you tell us more about the mechanism by which it prevents sperm production?"]},{"begin":"193.160","end":"228.760","lines":["Yes, absolutely. So one thing that\u2019s interesting to note is that in people of all sexes, if you have a severe vitamin A deficiency, that can really impact your fertility, and so the makers of this drug were really focused on this detail. And what they found out is that cells in the testes will take up vitamin A, metabolize vitamin A into this metabolite called retinoic acid; retinoic acid will bind to a receptor, and in that binding it\u2019ll drive changes in gene expression that leads to sperm production\u2014there\u2019s, like, a cascade of effects, and the consequence is that you get sperm."]},{"begin":"228.760","end":"232.000","lines":["And so what this drug does is it prevents that binding from happening ..."]},{"begin":"232.000","end":"232.480","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"232.480","end":"249.040","lines":["It prevents retinoic acid from binding to its receptor. And as a consequence it sort of breaks the chain, and, you know, all the various effects can\u2019t really cascade the way they would\u2014normally would, and you prevent sperm production that way. And then once you\u2019ve stopped taking the drug, after a while, you eventually regain that function."]},{"begin":"249.040","end":"256.840","lines":["Just, you know, remind us: Where are we at with male birth control in general right now? You know, what\u2019s available, what\u2019s in the works?"]},{"begin":"256.840","end":"276.920","lines":["Yeah, right now what people can currently get include just two things: you can get a vasectomy, or you can use condoms. And so, as far as male contraception goes, those are really the only two options, and neither one of those is particularly ideal, especially if you\u2019re someone who wants a reversible option to control your fertility."]},{"begin":"276.920","end":"318.600","lines":["At the moment there are several options in development, including this pill, which is a nonhormonal birth control pill taken daily. There\u2019s also a gel\u2014I think a lot of people will have heard of this gel. It\u2019s called Nest/T, which stands for a progestin called Nestorone, as well as testosterone. People who are doing hormone-replacement therapy will use a similar gel on their shoulders. It\u2019s a very, very similar mechanism. And this works a little bit similarly to the nonhormonal pill in that it stops sperm production reversibly. So that is probably the male contraceptive that is furthest along in development. That is currently on the cusp of starting phase 3 clinical trials."]},{"begin":"318.600","end":"343.000","lines":["There\u2019s also a reversible vasectomy. Some vasectomies, currently, surgically are reversible but not all of them, and this, quote, unquote, \u201creversible vasectomy\u201d is really an implant. And what it is, is that it\u2019s a tiny, little hydrogel that can be inserted into the vas deferens, and it just physically blocks sperm from being able to escape into the ejaculate. And so that is also pretty far along in development."]},{"begin":"343.000","end":"358.520","lines":["And those are really the two that are kind of closest to becoming released onto the market. Besides those two we then have this nonhormonal contraceptive pill that stops sperm production and, like, a few other smaller options that are also kind of in early, early development."]},{"begin":"358.520","end":"367.920","lines":["Yeah, so speaking of which: Where in development is this pill? I know there [was] some recent news about progress, but where does that leave us?"]},{"begin":"367.920","end":"391.760","lines":["So this pill currently just finished a clinical 1a trial, and what that means is that it has not been tested for efficacy yet; it has only been tested for safety. So in this trial\u2014and it was pretty small trial; it only involved, you know, like, a dozen healthy men\u2014in, in this small trial what was essentially being tested was how well people reacted to the pill ..."]},{"begin":"391.760","end":"392.240","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"392.240","end":"398.280","lines":["And whether or not levels of this drug stayed in the blood for, like, an adequate period of time."]},{"begin":"398.280","end":"414.800","lines":["And so this new development is exciting because it means that this pill is safe to take at the levels that we expect this pill might be taken if it goes to market, but we still don\u2019t really have data on how [effectively] it can reduce the sperm that people\u2019s bodies produce."]},{"begin":"414.800","end":"419.800","lines":["Yeah, and were there any side effects or, you know, anything that came up during the trial?"]},{"begin":"419.800","end":"446.400","lines":["So it looks really good so far. I will say that this trial was quite small, only 16 men, and it also didn\u2019t involve taking this drug for a long, long [period] of time. And so even though there were no side effects noted in the trial that they completed, we still have a long way to go to know whether or not anybody will have side effects once they start using it daily for months or years."]},{"begin":"446.400","end":"449.040","lines":["So what are the next steps for this drug?"]},{"begin":"449.040","end":"479.080","lines":["Yeah, so the next step for this drug is that they are now undergoing a clinical 1b trial and a clinical 2a trial, and what that means is that these will be larger trials involving more people taking this drug for, you know, more doses at a time and assessing not only safety but also efficacy. So they\u2019ll start to measure sperm counts and see whether or not sperm production reduces over time and, if so, by how much and how different doses of the drug affects that efficacy."]},{"begin":"479.080","end":"485.960","lines":["Very cool. And what\u2019s the timeline like to get from where this drug is now to actually reaching the market?"]},{"begin":"485.960","end":"502.240","lines":["That is a great question and [laughs] one that I think is not entirely predictable, for a number of reasons. You know, obviously, to get this drug to market it involves, you know, the [Food and Drug Administration] and, like, government regulators, and sometimes that can be, you know, not so predictable."]},{"begin":"502.240","end":"533.200","lines":["I did talk to someone who was involved in running this trial, and she said that she hoped that this drug would come to market within the next few years\u2014like, fewer than five years. And I do think it\u2019s possible, provided that the next trials go smoothly, that no major side effects are reported and that the government assesses the safety and etcetera in a timely manner\u2014I think that\u2019s maybe an unpredictable part."]},{"begin":"533.200","end":"568.120","lines":["But I do think that there is a demand for more contraceptive options, especially more male contraceptive options, and I think just the public sense of wanting various options to control that agency will contribute to, you know, these methods being available soon and pressure to, like, push these through and, and have them available on the market."]},{"begin":"568.120","end":"575.040","lines":["Thank you so much for coming on to talk us through this story, Hannah."]},{"begin":"575.040","end":"578.200","lines":["Great.
