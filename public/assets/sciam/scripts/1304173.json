It's there you'll find the breeding grounds of what may be the world's most punk-rock penguin. [Penguin calls] \u2026 which sports twin bleached-blond mohawks.\u00a0"

      "text": ": \"The final egg acts like an insurance policy for them, so if they lose one of the other eggs, they can rear the chick from that one. But this is quite the opposite. Because, in this case\u2014and this is why it's such a conundrum in the biological world\u2014they don't favor the first egg, they favor the second one.\""

      "text": ": Davis and his colleagues traveled to the Antipodes Islands in 1998 to investigate that conundrum. And in reanalyzing their data, they've narrowed down the possible explanations for this behavior. First, they think the penguins might reject the first egg because it forms while the birds are migrating, so it's smaller\u2014inferior, perhaps\u2014to the second, larger egg. And the penguins may\u00a0 be acknowledging a reality many species face\u2014they simply don't have the resources to rear two chicks.\u00a0 The study appears in the journal PLOS ONE. [Lloyd S. Davis et al, The breeding biology of erect-crested penguins, Eudyptes sclateri: Hormones, behavior, obligate brood reduction and conservation] Davis notes that the penguins are now endangered.\u00a0"
