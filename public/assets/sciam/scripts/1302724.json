Jandt is a former wildland firefighter. She\u2019s also a fire ecologist at the University of Alaska\u00a0Fairbanks\u2019s Alaska Fire Science Consortium. [Rebecca C.

It stands out not only because of how much work it took to put out\u00a0but also because in 1996\u00a0this kind of fire\u2014one that overwinters\u2014was very rare. But according to that study in Nature, zombie fires are becoming a more frequent phenomenon."},{"author":"Randi","text":"These can be stubborn, deep-burning fires that require pumps and hoses\u2014and, you know, a lot of effort to put out. One of our colleagues who had a full career smoke jumping in Alaska\u201446 years as a wildland firefighter\u2014saw that article in Nature\u00a0and related that it was an overwinter fire near Eagle, Alaska, called the Damien Fire.\u00a0That was the most work per acre of any fire he was ever on. And that 46 years, I thought that was pretty remarkable."},{"author":"Dow","text":"Well, I'm Rod Dow, and I smoke jumped for a long time. I fought fire for 45 or 46 or 47 years, depending on what you count. And all of that was on the fire line."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"Rod Dow is now retired but he has hours of stories to share from his lengthy career as a wildland firefighter and smoke jumper. He says he has vivid memories of that 1996 fire out on the Alaska-Canada border. I find it really remarkable that I can call you and say, \u201cHey Rod, tell me about the Damien Fire,\u201d and you remember all these details."},{"author":"Dow","text":"Yeah, that one, you know\u2014it was\u2014it was the work."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"The work?"},{"author":"Dow","text":"There was no\u2014there was nothing enjoyable about any of it. It was just constant 14 days of 14 hours a day. And I\u2019ve never seen a fire that was that, that amount of labor per acre. It was just really amazing."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"The Damien Fire was estimated at 6.66 acres. It was deemed the Damien Fire, so named for the 1978 thriller\u00a0The Omen, about a man who replaces his stillborn son with a living one, only to find he may have adopted a relentlessly murderous Antichrist. [CLIP: Trailer for The Omen] The fire smoldered underground in the winter of 1995, burning into 1996 under stands of trees that toppled over on one another like pick-up sticks. Firefighters call this \u201cdog hair,\u201d and they have to cut through it all with chainsaws to attack the blaze.\u00a0"},{"author":"Dow","text":"If you could picture four football fields continuously strewn with logs at chest-deep level. You know, a gap, in between, the logs would be about big enough to stand in, maybe. So there was\u2014it was nearly continuous logs crisscrossed on top of each other, and then underneath all of that was this foot-deep boiling ash."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"Much like Damien in The Omen,\u00a0overwintering fires just don\u2019t seem to give up."},{"author":"Dow","text":"I mean, that is an enormous amount of chainsawing, and that doesn't even count the, you know, putting the heat out."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"For two weeks, Dow and a team of firefighters went after the smoldering forest floor. He says eight chainsaws were running at once, alongside a high-pressure fire hose\u00a0connected to a pump."},{"author":"Dow","text":"That water is turning to steam at an enormous rate\u00a0because there\u2019s hundreds of gallons of water coming out the end of the hose, and it\u2019s all turning to steam at once. And so it\u2019s blasting these giant steam clouds. And because it\u2019s exploding out of there, out of the ground, it\u2019s carrying all this ash up into the air around you."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"Since 2005\u00a0scientists have noted at least 40 overwintering wildfires in the Alaskan and Canadian Far North. The Arctic is warming at least three times faster than other parts of the world. That means the snowpack in places like Alaska is melting earlier in the year.\u00a0According to the Alaska Fire Science Consortium, more than two and half times as much acreage burned in the northernmost state between 2001 and 2020 in comparison to the 1990s. These zombie fires are still rare, accounting for just under 1 percent of all land burned annually in Alaska and Canada. But there have been single years where the area burned by these underground infernos has been described as \u201cexceptional\u201d\u2014totaling up to about 38 percent\u2014in the region."},{"author":"Jandt","text":"Well, really, the reason that they are starting to overwinter somewhat more frequently goes along with these warmer summers and the opportunity for us to get deeper drying into those deep organic moss layers that underlie the forest and the tundra. And that\u2019s the key. So if the fire can get deeply embedded into those organic, peaty, kind of duff layers, they can just hide out."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"The boreal forest, also known as taiga, is the largest terrestrial biome on the planet. And thanks to climate warming, this ecosystem is becoming increasingly vulnerable to wildfire. That\u2019s significant, because estimates show at least one third of the world\u2019s terrestrial carbon is stored in these forests\u2014in the trees, in the soil, in the understory plants\u2014and when it burns, this carbon is released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Jandt says the increasing prevalence of zombie fires could challenge fire and land managers who are already struggling to find ways to bolster thin budgets."},{"author":"Jandt:'","text":"So\u00a0the time of year they might begin to pop up in early spring is often really early, where fire crews are still being hired, trained, and there\u2019s not many aircraft on contract yet. And, you know, firefighters are aware that a fire, if it\u2019s been smoldering all winter, it may have burned very deep into the ground, and it could be hard to take it out and, you know, extinguish it."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"In the last two fire seasons, other parts of the world dominated by boreal forest have also seen overwintering fires, and Jandt says that may be where some of her research goes next."},{"author":"Jandt","text":"So when we start looking at Siberia and Eurasia, that\u2019s going to be really interesting because ... overwintering fires seem to have been [a] really important contributor to that really awesome fire season\u2014awesome in a bad way\u2014that Siberia had in 2020, you know? Did you hear about that? They burned 35 million acres. Yeah, I mean, can you wrap your head around that? Oregon thought they had a bad season in 2020\u2014it was less than a million acres burned. So, I mean, 35 million is amazing."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"Fires that overwintered started popping up again last spring, contributing to another intense fire season in Siberia this past year. Jandt says there\u2019s no doubt much of this change in the fire environment is due to a changing climate. From a science perspective, she says it\u2019s an exciting time to be a fire ecologist...."},{"author":"Jandt","text":"\u00a0Just because it\u2019s so astounding to be able to measure it over your career\u2014one person\u2019s career."},{"author":"Schwing","text":"She says the way these fires are burning has a transformative effect on everything from the topography\u00a0to the plants that return once the fire is finally out. But\u00a0what if that fire is never entirely extinguished? Could zombie fires turn more vampiric\u2014like Dracula, draining the life from forests to sustain the flames forever?\u00a0 It\u2019s unlikely if firefighters like Rod Dow keep their chainsaws sharpened, their certifications current, and there\u2019s enough in the budget to go around.
