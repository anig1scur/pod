Our growing understanding of the microbes that live on us, in us and around us has scientists analyzing\u2014and trying to tweak\u2014colonies from our armpits to our genitals. But when most of us hear the word \u201cmicrobiome\u201d our minds go first to the diverse ecosystems found within our guts."},{"author":"","text":"The communities of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi that live in our digestive tracts have a huge impact on us. Research shows that our gut microbiomes influence how well we digest our food and absorb nutrients, and an imbalance in the microorganisms of the gut is associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic liver disease. Some research even suggests that our gut microbiomes are tied to cognitive function and mental well-being: scientists are exploring how autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD and more could be connected to the tiny creatures that live inside us."},{"author":"","text":"But this relationship isn\u2019t one-sided: we also have a lot of power over our gut microbiomes\u2014and that extends beyond our food choices."},{"author":"","text":"Our guest today is Lydia Denworth, a contributing editor for Scientific American. She writes SciAm\u2019s Science of Health column. In the magazine\u2019s June 2025 issue she reported on the surprising link between gut microbes and exercise. She\u2019s here today to tell us more."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Lydia Denworth","text":"It\u2019s good to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you recently wrote in your column about the microbiome, which, of course, our listeners have heard a lot about, but I think people tend to think about their microbiome and think about yogurts and probiotics. But you wrote about the connection to exercise. How did you first come across that connection?"},{"author":"Denworth","text":"I was at a science journalist conference, and I heard Marc Cook talk\u2014he\u2019s one of the people I interviewed for that column\u2014and he\u2019s a researcher at North Carolina [Agricultural and Technical] State University, and he studies exercise in the microbiome, and it was exactly what you just said that got him interested."},{"author":"","text":"I mean, everybody thinks about diet, probiotics, things like that. And back about 15 years ago he was at the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] getting his Ph.D., and the idea that there might be a link between exercise and microbes in your gut was really just not a thing that anybody was thinking about. But he did know that people with inflammatory bowel disease, specifically ulcerative colitis, benefited from exercise. So he thought, \u201cWell, let me investigate, maybe, what that\u2019s about.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"So he stuck mice on wheels\u2014you know, mice like to run on wheels\u2014and he found that the mice that voluntarily exercised were protected against a mouse version of colitis and the ones that did not run were not. And so it kinda started there, with this idea that, \u201cOh, there\u2019s more to look at.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So now, you know, more than a decade later, what do we know about the connection between exercise and the gut microbiome?"},{"author":"Denworth","text":"We know a couple of things. So one thing is: in people who are regular exercisers or who are elite athletes the diversity and abundance of microbes in your gut is greater, but more important than that is this question of, \u201cWhat do the microbes actually do?\u201d And that\u2019s where the researchers have really kind of gone down the rabbit hole and said, \u201cWell, why would it be that exercise is improving your fitness?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And what they found is that exercise boosts the production of microbes that produce something called short-chain fatty acids. And that\u2019s a simple molecule, but it\u2019s something that helps with your gut health. It helps reduce inflammation. It is part of your healthy metabolism. So the metabolism makes energy, right, and when you exercise and then you boost these short-chain fatty acids, especially one called butyrate, it improves all these processes that your body needs to do to stay healthy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Can you tell us a little bit more about what the functional differences in the microbiomes of people who are getting this boost from exercise versus not? You know, what does that diversity of microbes do for us?"},{"author":"Denworth","text":"There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know yet about exactly what it is that the microbes are doing versus the other benefits of exercise, so there are open questions there. But having this healthy, active microbiome that they see in athletes and from exercise seems to increase your capacity for exercise. It probably works in both directions\u2014it\u2019s bidirectional."},{"author":"","text":"So the research on the other side of it is really only in mice so far. But they do find that if, for instance, you give mice antibiotics that kill off the bacteria in their guts, they are less likely to exercise and they reach exhaustion faster. They also find that a healthy microbiome seems to contribute to muscle development\u2014and then vice versa, right: you don\u2019t develop as many muscles as effectively if you don\u2019t have a healthy microbiome."},{"author":"","text":"And so all of that is in the beginning stages of research, but it\u2014it\u2019s intriguing, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and do the researchers behind this have any specific recommendations for what kind of exercise or how much is gonna, you know, help your microbiome out?"},{"author":"Denworth","text":"So far the research doesn\u2019t really change what the standard recommendations are, which is that we engage in about 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week or 75 minutes of intense exercise a week. The research does suggest that it\u2019s aerobic exercise more than strength training that is having this effect\u2014although it\u2019s such early days and there have been so few studies of other kinds of exercise other than aerobic that I think we don\u2019t know for sure that it\u2019s not happening with other forms of exercise, but aerobic exercise is where it\u2019s at. The recommendations are the same; it\u2019s just more reason to get out there and gut out your workout [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Absolutely. And remind us what\u2019s the general advice for supporting a good, diverse, healthy gut microbiome?"},{"author":"Denworth","text":"Well, diet is the number one thing that affects your microbiome\u2014more powerfully than exercise, I should say that\u2014and fiber in particular is really important for having a good, healthy gut. But then exercise\u2014probably combining a healthy diet that includes a lot of fiber and doing some good aerobic exercise is going to be the best combination that\u2019s gonna give you the healthiest gut."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Great, so just more motivation to do the things that we already know are good for us [laughs]."},{"author":"Denworth","text":"[Laughs] That\u2019s exactly it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been great."},{"author":"Denworth","text":"Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
