And to be fair, the ants have a few tricks that enable them to do that."},{"author":"Knaden","text":"We know from them they use a sun compass to get an idea what direction they walk, and they count their steps to get an idea of the distances they cover in an individual direction. And by that, they always compute their relative position to the nest."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"But the scientists noticed the ants had another trick, too. The farther their burrows were into that flat, featureless plain, away from plants and rocks and other landmarks, the more the ants tended to build big mounds at the entrances of their nests. These are volcano-looking humps in the salt pan, sometimes more than 10 inches tall. As a means of comparison, for these tiny ants, that\u2019s the equivalent of a human standing in front of a mountain the size of London\u2019s Big Ben. And the researchers wanted to see if the ants really used these things for navigation."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So they destroyed a number of the mounds and put tall cylinders at some of the nest entrances instead. And at others, they put no landmark at all."},{"author":"Freire","text":"And what we realized was ants with no artificial landmarks displayed a bigger effort into rebuilding their nest mounds surrounding their nest entrance than those that had the artificial visual landmarks."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"In other words, the ants presumably needed some sort of landmark at the colony to ensure everyone could find it. And if it wasn\u2019t there, they\u2019d build it. The details are in the journal Current Biology. The scientists say the ants must be working together to do this because the ones going out to forage need to collectively agree with those who stay put in the nest that the colony needs a landmark. So the \u201cexplorers\u201d need to convince the \u201chomebodies\u201d to build one. Knaden says it\u2019s remarkable the ants can do all that with such a tiny brain."},{"author":"Knaden","text":"Makes me always thinking, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we much better with our big brain?\u201d But I\u2019m so bad at navigation, compared to those ants, I\u2019m a bit jealous.
