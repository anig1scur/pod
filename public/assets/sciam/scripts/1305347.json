And in that case, who gets to profit from the performance?"},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"This is Tech, Quickly, the digital double of Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly podcast. I\u2019m Sophie Bushwick, tech editor at Scientific American."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"And I\u2019m Tulika Bose, senior multimedia editor. [CLIP: Music cue]"},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"So, Sophie, I actually kind of spoke to a few actor friends about what\u2019s happening right now, and why people are striking."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"I get the impression that some people are worried they\u2019re going to lose their jobs to an AI."},{"author":"Wolfgang Hunter","text":"The worst case scenario would be there\u2019s no more extra work, which is just like such a useful thing for a lot of like working actors, like even nonspeaking roles, extra work, like, that\u2019s money, And if you can just AI generate a crowd and then doesn\u2019t look like unrealistic\u2014the thought of that is very scary."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"That\u2019s my friend Wolfgang Hunter, an actor, comic, and writer in New York City who has written for shows like Mr. Beast. [CLIP: \u201cI love the Midwest. Even the hecklers are nice people.\u201d] A lot of actors\u2014even if you\u2019ve seen them before\u2014need to do everything they can to pay the bills.\u00a0"},{"author":"Hunter: ","text":"So it\u2019s scary to think that if you sign a waiver, you could just like, be never getting work again, even as like an extra."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"So Sophie didn\u2019t you speak with someone about this too?"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"That\u2019s right \u2014 I spoke with Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California Berkeley who studies this type of technology. He says this idea, that generative AI can take an actor\u2019s image and insert it into any scene, is just putting a new name on existing tech."},{"author":"Hany Farid: ","text":"We used to call it deepfakes which was scary sounding and was largely associated with things like non-consensual sexual imagery and fraud and disinformation. Somebody in the industry did some very good rebranding and can now we call it generative Ai which sounds less scary and less awful. It is the same core underlying technology."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"I tend to associate deepfakes with video. But generative AI can also be used to make still images, text, music, and other audio."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"And this is also kind of worrying for actors who also rely on voice work."},{"author":"Hunter","text":"What's on the line right now is reoccurring work. So especially with like voice acting and stuff like that \u2014 AI can\u2019t like generate a new voice or a new character, but it can mimic existing ones."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"So this character that Wolfgang voices, for example... [CLIP: \u201cI don\u2019t know TheLittle Mermaid. I don\u2019t listen to hip-hop.\u201d]"},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"Could be easily sampled and replaced, right?"},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Exactly. And Hany talked about how easy this is with AI tools."},{"author":"Farid: ","text":"If I for example, Sophie record 2 minutes of your voice just 2 minutes nothing sophisticated just on this call right now: I can now go over to a commercial website and for $5 a month I can clone your voice and have you say anything I want you to say."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Of course, my voice clone might sound more realistic if the AI developers gave it more clips of my voice. In general, the more data you canprovide, the more realistic the digital double will look or sound."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Oh, digital double; kind of creepy."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Very creepy."},{"author":"Farid","text":"With a single image I can insert somebody who\u2019s linking this into a video but because I've only got one view of them. It's going\u00a0 to be gonna be a little glitchy, and it will not hold up to Hollywood style. It's fine for Tiktok and Youtube\u2014but it\u2019s not gonna it\u2019s not gonna pass muster for Hollywood."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"The technology might get better eventually, but for now, actors have to go through something called the orb!"},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Okay, so it\u2019s technically called a photogrammetry stage. But a video game actor who has performed on one of these stages, and who asked to remain anonymous, described it as \u201cthe orb\u201d when he spoke to our tech reporting fellow, Lauren Leffer."},{"author":"Bose: ","text":"Very science fictional!"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"Oh, absolutely. I\u2019m going to quote Lauren directly here:\u00a0\u201cInside the orb, the world is reduced to a sphere of white light and flashes. Outside the orb\u2019s\u00a0skeletal frame is darkness. Imagine you are strapped into a chair inside this contraption. A voice from the darkness suggests expressions: ways to pose your mouth and eyebrows, scenarios to react to, phrases to say and emotions to embody. At irregular intervals, the voice also tells you not to worry, explains that more flashes are coming soon.\u201d"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Well, that sounds freakin\u2019 terrifying."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Yeah, it does not seem like a pleasant experience! But if you\u2019re a working actor, you have to put up with a lot of stuff like that for the job. And, on the one hand, AI is making it way easier to duplicate an actor\u2019s image even without the orb\u2014which just ramps up the pressure for performers to sign away their images."},{"author":"Hunter","text":"I am, like, such a guy that has such a bad habit of just signing something and not reading it. Absolute whatever. Yeah, cameras right there. Yeah, you're just like, lizard. But I think if I knew what I was looking at, I don't know. Because it's like, at the end of the day, that's all you have is yourself, you know, when you can't even get work or you're not even like in the industry, like fully. You only have this. You're basically selling, like, it's the closest thing I think we've actually had to selling your soul."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So one goal of the strike is for actors to protect themselves from having to sell their image\u2014or to make sure that, if their digital double is going to show up in a bunch of future media, that they\u2019ll be fairly compensated for that."},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And it\u2019s not just their own digital doubles that they need protection from. Remember how Wolfgang said AI can\u2019t generate a new character?"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Uh oh."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Yeah, I don\u2019t know about audio-only characters. But AI can absolutely generate images of humans who have never existed. Farid: I can now just whole cloth create the next generation of performers. That's not a replacement. That's a creation. I can decide, look, we're going to do market research and we're going to say, well you know a blend between George Clooney and Brad Pitt and fill in your favorite actors. There is you know? So maybe you create this sort of this chimera right? This hybrid.\u00a0"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Or, say, Timothee Chalamet? [CLIP: \u201cJanie\u2019s hella tight. Maybe I\u2019ll see you at the Deuce.\u201d]"},{"author":"Bushwick","text":"And if you have an AI-generated fake actor, it can be customized to different markets. Maybe there\u2019s one version designed to appeal to Americans..."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Another version for the Middle East and another one for Chinese markets."},{"author":"Farid","text":"So the studios, they may not even need performers. These things can be created whole cloth. Um, so it's not even a replacement anymore. It\u2019s something different."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Okay, yeah, this is a lot worse than we thought."},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"I understand why actors are striking! But also, if the studios want to go all-in on AI, then sure, they might be able to cut out some of the humans in front of the camera. They might even be able to save some money. But it could also majorly backfire for them."},{"author":"Farid: ","text":"If this technology really gets good where I can go to ChatGPT and say,\u00a0please write me a movie script with this storyline and these sorts of themes and then I can synthesize the voices of the characters and synthesize the videos and do all of that on my laptop,\u00a0do we democratize access to filmmaking?\u00a0It's an interesting question. Maybe it\u2019s not going to be Hollywood studios right now. The performers are scared for their jobs, and I think they have the right to be. But what if the studio should be fearful? What if the very studios that are jamming up the performers\u2014what if they\u2019re next?"},{"author":"Bushwick: ","text":"Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose, Kelso Harper and Carin Leong.
