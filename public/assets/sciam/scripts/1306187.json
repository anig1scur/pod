A lot of platforms did establish really strong moderation policies after the 2016 election, but more recently, a lot of them have laid off or reduced the trust and safety teams in charge of this, and that makes them much slower to respond to misinformation.

It\u2019s a really good tool by the way. At no cost to you, completely free, will check that image for you ... and will give you an idea of other examples of that image being posted online and what the context behind it is.... It, it takes minutes. Or you can just do it and go to images.google.com and either copy the URL of that image on, on whichever social media platform you\u2019re on or take a screen grab of it yourself. You could just do it, and go to images.google.com and just put the screen grab in there, and run reverse image search for yourself."
