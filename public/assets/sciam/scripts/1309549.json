He now finds himself defending scientific agencies from unprecedented attacks at a time when climate change is pushing weather patterns into uncharted territory."},{"author":"","text":"Today we\u2019re talking to Eric about how his scientific background shapes his approach to politics, what he\u2019d change about the country\u2019s approach to catastrophic weather events and why he thinks more scientists should consider running for office."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Eric Sorensen","text":"Oh, it\u2019s great to be with you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019d love to start with a little bit about your background as a meteorologist. How did you get interested in the field, and what was your career like?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Yeah, I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, and I grew up afraid of storms; I grew up afraid of, of tornadoes, right? And I just had this intense reaction every time they occurred, and I wanted to learn more. I\u2019ll never forget\u2014I thought it was a punishment when my mom and dad took me to the library. They were like, \u201cAll right, we need to get Eric to learn more about weather.\u201d [Laughs] Right? And so I\u2019m just, like\u2014as I started learning about it, I was hooked on it as a kid, and so all I wanted to be was the meteorologist on TV, and you know what? I got to do that for 22 years, and it was, like, it was awesome."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so then what got you into politics?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"So, you know, I\u2019ll tell you: a lot of different things. I was somebody who worked in my hometown of Rockford, Illinois, and aside from working in the district that I now serve in the Congress, I worked for a couple of years in Texas, and I am a believer and a lover of science. Everything that I do, I\u2019m, I\u2019m thinking about, \u201cWhat is a scientific angle?\u201d to whatever we do. And I\u2019m sitting in the weather center, I\u2019m forecasting the weather, at WQAD-TV in the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Eric Sorensen delivering a weather forecast on WQAD-TV: \u201cHi there, everybody, meteorologist Eric Sorensen of the Storm Track 8 Weather Center ...\u201d]"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And the top story was: our congresswoman Cheri Bustos announced that she was retiring. And the news anchors across the studio from me, they pointed at me, and they\u2019re like, \u201cYou need to do that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be a politician. That\u2019s stupid. That is the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d right?"},{"author":"","text":"I honestly was watching the ceiling fan go around, trying to go to sleep that night, and I thought to myself, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I do that?\u201d Right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"We were going through a pandemic, where we didn\u2019t have enough communicators of science. As we were understanding it, as we were learning it, we needed to communicate it. We only had one Anthony Fauci; we needed 10,000 of him."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And so I realized that it wasn\u2019t so much just meteorology but just by being there for people every day and really being trusted, it was the recipe for being elected to Congress. Because I\u2019m gonna tell you, I was a total nerd in school\u2014I would not have been elected the treasurer of my high school class\u2014but the first time I ran for Congress, I won."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And how has your background informed how you operate as a politician, and I\u2019m also curious, you know, how has your introduction to politics influenced you as a science communicator?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Well, look, I thought I was just going to go to the Congress and be the communicator of climate."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I thought that that\u2019s going to be the lane that I need to travel as a meteorologist, okay? And, and for\u2014in many instances that\u2019s what I do. But then, to be an outsider elected to Congress, it\u2019s a unique perspective, right, because nobody communicates well there at all; we don\u2019t communicate any of the s\u2014 that people need to know about."},{"author":"","text":"And so, like, I get there, and I realize, \u201cOh, wait a minute, Congress has an approval rating of what, like, 20 percent\u201d\u2014something like that\u2014\u201cfor good reason,\u201d right? Because nobody there is doing a good job of communicating back home that they\u2019re doing their jobs or that they\u2019re connecting with people or creating these solutions. And then, for me, I will tell you, one of the things that has helped is: I don\u2019t have a background in politics, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"If my background is in science and communicating science, I have to challenge people on the other side of the aisle a lot, but ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"They\u2019re not afraid to work with me, you know ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"When we need to do some important things."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And what have some of your biggest accomplishments been since you were elected?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I\u2019ll tell you, in the first Congress one of the things that\u2014it\u2019s not necessarily related to science\u2014but it was making sure that we passed the All-American Flag Act. It sounds really minuscule, but I\u2019m like, the federal government spends a lot of money on flags, and they should be made in America, by American fibers ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And making sure that the grommets are made in America. It is something simple-sounding, but it was really hard to get through the Congress, and people had been trying to do that, and I was able to do that."},{"author":"","text":"Now, I\u2019ll tell you, things have changed in this Congress, you know, as you have President Trump that decides that he\u2019s gonna go after and DOGE go\u2014goes after the National Weather Service and how important these things are and how important the science of understanding climate is. As he goes after it I am the pushback, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I\u2019m leading that pushback to make sure that we\u2019re going to stand up for science and stand up for meteorology and climatology."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and I would love to talk a little bit more about that\u2014you know, what, what have you and your colleagues been doing in response to these attacks on the National Weather Service?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I didn\u2019t think that I was gonna have to argue the importance of the weather service, but, you know, I\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m here, right?"},{"author":"","text":"And then it was finding members on the other side of the aisle that understand the importance of it. So Congressman ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Mike Flood, he\u2019s a Republican out in eastern Nebraska\u2014also, I wanna say, as a meteorologist, I have to work with a guy named Mike Flood [laughs]. I\u2019m just like\u2014I have to."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Sure, yeah."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Right? And so he\u2014like, in eastern Nebraska they get a lot of tornadoes ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And so we put forth a bill and we\u2019re championing a bill through the Congress that says that National Weather Service employees are essential and that we need to hire them back. And we\u2019re seeing success: we\u2019re seeing that the Trump administration is turning, and now NOAA is able to hire these people back."},{"author":"","text":"I\u2019m working with Congressman Nathaniel Moran. This congressman is in the reddest part of Texas, but also it\u2019s Tyler, Texas\u2014it\u2019s the only place that I worked outside of Illinois\u2014so we have this, like, common bond ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"\u2019Cause I worked at KLTV. And so it\u2019s: \u201cHow are we getting the important weather information to rural America?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And we started working on that before the tragedy happened in Texas. And so it\u2019s: \u201cHow can we make better policy that is not just going to be reactionary when we have these climate-fueled disasters?\u201d It\u2019s: \u201cHow are we going to be up front, before they occur?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and do you think that your colleagues in Washington in general and the administration specifically, do you think most of them understand the breadth of what the National Weather Service does and how important it is?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"The tragedy that occurred in Texas, that\u2019s in Chip Roy\u2019s district ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"He is one of the most conservative Republican members. So he understands the value of it. He\u2019s not coming out against this now ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Sorsensen","text":"Because it happened to him. Tornado Alley: Oklahoma and Kansas and Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama\u2014these are all red states. Or if you look at these hurricane-prone states, much the same: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida\u2014they\u2019re red states, right? So we can\u2019t politicize the science of meteorology."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right ..."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And I, I would even go even farther than that: to say we should never politicize climatology either."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and speaking of the politicization of climatology we were just talking on the show recently about the push to pull back the endangerment finding and the report that doesn\u2019t just seem to attack the endangerment finding specifically but does a lot of undermining the basic, accepted science of climate change. What are your thoughts on that? You know, what do you think that Congress and other elected reps can do about that situation?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Well, I think, it\u2019s fascinating to me\u2014the far right, they\u2019re trying to make it more mainstream, that they want people to believe that somehow there\u2019s climate modification going on, or that there\u2019s some sinister\u2014like, airplanes are spraying chemicals into the air and there are all of these nefarious reasons for what you\u2019re seeing, as opposed to understanding the basic climate science that says that humans are causing it but in a different way. Why is it that some people are so susceptible to believing conspiracy theory, yet they won\u2019t believe the actual science?"},{"author":"","text":"The science is pretty easy: that we can identify the carbon in the atmosphere to know that carbon occurred because we were burning fossil fuels. We understand these are basic principles of atmospheric science. We know that CO2 is the number one driver of global warming. Yet we don\u2019t do anything about it."},{"author":"","text":"And I will even say, as we are recording this, I\u2019ve got an air-quality alert in ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"My part of northwestern Illinois. And we had\u2014forgive me; I use hand gestures when I talk about the weather\u2014we had a cold front come through the area, and now we\u2019re seeing a northerly wind, and that northerly wind is coming off of wildfires in northern Ontario."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Let\u2019s understand why this is occurring now versus before ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Because now we\u2019ve pushed the jet stream so far to the north that the thunderstorms that are producing the cloud-to-ground lightning, okay, they used to happen in the Prairie provinces, right? They used to happen where Canada had fire departments because there\u2019s highways, right? We can go ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"And fight them. But now the jet stream is so far to the north that the cloud-to-ground lightning is hitting in forests that are hundreds of miles away from civilization. And so there\u2019s no way for those to go out."},{"author":"","text":"And as a meteorologist, but also as a congressman, I\u2019m communicating to the people here that what you\u2019re seeing with these air-quality alerts\u2014we had the worst air quality in the world the other day\u2014this is the new norm. This is the new norm ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Because we have changed the climate so much, and I don\u2019t know\u2014no one knows\u2014what are the health ramifications for how we\u2019ve changed it? That\u2019s something that we\u2019re gonna know, unfortunately, decades from now."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. What issues are you most concerned about right now when it comes to weather and the climate, and what sort of projects and enterprises are you excited about?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"So, look, I worry that we may have people become apathetic ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"When it comes to the climate crisis. I wish that we would\u2019ve done more. I wish that we had curbed our emissions, that we had done that in the past 10, 20 years, when we understood it, as opposed to just arguing over it. One of my motivations is to be the science guy, the meteorologist that\u2019s not afraid to work in the middle of the aisle to be able to get people to understand that we need to move this forward; we need to make sure that we\u2019re innovating, that we\u2019re sustaining the next generation\u2014 also, that it\u2019s smart to do right by the next generation."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Let\u2019s talk about those things. So I do worry that as I am finding movement to move forward in the center of the aisle\u2014even in a Trump administration it is occurring, right ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I worry that as I move people forward we\u2019re gonna lose the people that are maybe to the left that will say, \u201cIt\u2019s too late of a cause. Why did I try so much?\u201d And so we do need to make sure that we don\u2019t give up on this. It\u2019s not worth ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yep."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Giving up, and we can\u2019t do it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. And what are you feeling optimistic about right now?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"I\u2019m really excited because I\u2019ve been working kind of day in, day out right now\u2014after the tragedy that we saw on the Guadalupe River in Texas, when I started seeing politicians just pointing fingers at each other and I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna solve a problem.\u201d Or: Do we argue how fast FEMA is going to get there afterwards? Why aren\u2019t we looking at what happened before?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"In the same respect, when we have an air disaster in this country, we have the [National Transportation Safety Board]. The NTSB goes and looks through every piece of data before the disaster occurred, everything that led up to it, so that we can change the policy, that we can change design."},{"author":"","text":"I looked back: 1985, there was a horrific plane crash in North Texas\u2014it was Delta 191. That hit wind shear, it hit a microburst from a storm, and it crashed and killed a lot of people. I was nine years old. It was the first thing that I really thought about when I was like, \u201cOh, meteorology played a role here.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"But we don\u2019t have this type of air disaster happening because we implemented Doppler radar at the biggest airports in the country now, so we can identify it so that airplanes don\u2019t go into it. But that finding needs to happen every time there\u2019s a weather disaster. And so I\u2019m proposing an NWSB of sorts. Why can\u2019t we go back and look, before the tragedy occurred, every piece that went wrong? \u2019Cause I think you\u2019re probably gonna realize that it isn\u2019t necessarily [going to be] in our lack of understanding of science. It\u2019s gonna be in social science. It\u2019s going to be ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"\u201cHow do people perceive risk? Do people understand what is at stake? Do people understand that every time your phone goes off, it isn\u2019t gonna kill you, but you need to pay attention for that one time where there is something that could?\u201d And then develop the policy that\u2019s gonna save people in the future. And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s a pretty good legacy to have, if we could do that in a bipartisan way."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. Is there anything we haven\u2019t touched on that you think is important for us to talk about before I let you go?"},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"A lot of people, they said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a meteorologist could be elected to Congress.\u201d And one of the things that I wanna be able to say is\u2014it was really hard to blaze a trail through the jungle, right? I feel like I was trying to chop down all of these branches [laughs] to, to fight to find this path. And I wanna be able to look back on this path and see the next person coming up. I wanna be able to see other people say, \u201cI wanna take part in this; I feel like I can make a difference,\u201d and that, actually, science is one of those things that can bring us together when politics wants to break us apart."},{"author":"","text":"And so my hope is, even though I\u2019m just one meteorologist in Congress, that it will inspire other people and other people in science to say, \u201cYou know what? We do need to communicate these other things, too.\u201d Or maybe if there\u2019s a meteorologist somewhere out there that has worked in television for 25 years, earning the trust, that they\u2019re gonna start to think, \u201cWait a minute, I might be that person.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Or if it\u2019s somebody listening to this podcast that says, \u201cOh my gosh, I really trust this person. They have really helped me. Maybe I need to reach out to them and say, \u2018Did you know there\u2019s a meteorologist in Congress? I want you ...\u2019\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"\u201c\u2018To do this because you\u2019ve helped me.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s what public service has to be about."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today. I really appreciate it."},{"author":"Sorensen","text":"Oh, it was great, and I hope to be on again in the future, if you\u2019ll have me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
