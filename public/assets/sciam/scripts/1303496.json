Dr. Huda Zoghbi has devoted her career to unraveling these puzzles. She shares The Kavli Prize with Jean-Louis Mandel, Harry Orr, and Christopher Walsh for discovering the genetic pathways behind serious brain disorders.\u00a0 Scientific American Custom Media, in partnership with The Kavli Prize, spoke with Huda to learn more about her research.\u00a0 The Kavli Prize is a prestigious honor on its own, but the award holds a special place in Dr. Huda Zogbhi\u2019s heart.\u00a0"

Dr. Huda Zoghbi is a Professor at Baylor College of Medicine,\u00a0the Director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\u00a0 This year, she shared The Kavli Prize in Neuroscience with Harry Orr, Jean-Louis Mandel, and Christopher Walsh. The Kavli Prize honors scientists for breakthroughs in astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience\u2014transforming our understanding of the big, the small and the complex. The Kavli Prize is a partnership among the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, and the US-based Kavli Foundation.\u00a0 This work was produced by Scientific American Custom Media and made possible through the support of The Kavli Prize.
