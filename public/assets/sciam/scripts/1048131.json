In this series, we\u2019re asking what we can learn from those with marginalized experiences to explore sexuality, get to the bottom of BDSM and illuminate asexuality. In this episode we\u2019ll unpack why heterosexual women are having fewer orgasms than their male partners\u2014and how researchers are bridging the gap.

That\u2019s true even while research has shown that women regularly orgasm when masturbating and having sex with other women. That\u2019s a gap that needs to be addressed because not only does orgasm make sex more pleasurable, but regular orgasm, doctors say, also lowers stress and improves sleep, mood, cognition and self-esteem. In partnership with Indiana University, the people behind OMGYES have interviewed more than 20,000 women ages 18 to 95, resulting in a number ofpublishedpapers."

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson observed about 10,000 sexual response cycles experienced by 382 female participants and 312 male ones. Here\u2019s them speaking at the University of New Mexico in December 1973. [CLIP: Masters and Johnson speak at the University of New Mexico in December 197300:32] [Masters: \u201cWe never treat the impotent male or the nonorgasmic female as a single entity. We always treat the marital unit or the committed unit ...\u201d] [Johnson: \u201cOr the relationship, if you want to reduce it further.\u201d] [Masters: \u201cBasically speaking, we treat the relationship.\u201d]"

      "text": "They concluded that orgasm was the third of a four-stage model. They called the first \u201cexcitement,\u201d or sexual arousal\u2014marked by increased heart rate, breathing and blood flow. For those with a vagina, this involves engorgement of the clitoris, labia majora and minora and uterus, as well as vaginal lubrication. In the second, or plateau, phase, they noted, these responses build, and the uterus becomes fully elevated, which makes penetration more comfortable. The third stage they named was orgasm, or sexual climax\u2014a series of muscle spasms in the genital area at 0.8-second intervals that gradually slow in speed and intensity. These are accompanied by the release of tension and feelings of euphoria. Orgasm, they said, is followed by the fourth and final stage\u2014resolution, a return to the prearousal state. Masters and Johnson revolutionized the study of sexual response. But sex researcher Shere Hite had even more to say about sexual experience. This is her on a panel in 1977: [CLIP: Shere Hite on a panel in April 1977:3:45 \u201cSo Masters and Johnson have said how widespread women\u2019s sexual dysfunction is. And I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not women who are dysfunctional; it\u2019s our definition of sex which makes women dysfunctional. If you didn\u2019t define sex as intercourse, women wouldn\u2019t be dysfunctional.\u201d]"

      "author": "McDonough: ",
      "text": "The year before, Hite surveyed more than 3,000 women and girls aged 14 to 78 in open-ended, anonymous questionnaires, culminating in her book, The Hite Report. The book would be translated into a dozen languages and sell more than 48 million copies. Almost all of the women she interviewed who masturbated said that they orgasmed regularly from masturbation, but only about 30 percent reported that they orgasmed regularly from penile-vaginal intercourse. Here she is again in the panel discussion. [CLIP: Shere Hite: \u201cAnd even for this 30 percent, orgasm was, in most cases, due to the women\u2019s own assertiveness in obtaining clitoral contact with the man\u2019s pubic area during intercourse. Whether or not this is practical for a woman depends on many things.\u201d]"

      "text": "Even though sex researcher Alfred Kinsey had previously found in 1953 that it takes women four minutes, on average, to masturbate to orgasm, Hite was seen as widely controversial at the time for challenging deeply entrenched cultural norms."

      "text": "In the years after The Hite Report was published, Hite faced heavy criticism and even death threats. She ultimately fled the United States for Europe. Hite\u2019s research debunked the notion that women who didn\u2019t reliably orgasm from penetrative sex were dysfunctional. It was part of a wider cultural awakening, via second-wave feminism in the 1970s, that questioned who was served and who was hurt by such a narrow definition of \u201csex,\u201d which Hite and others explicitly related to equality outside of the bedroom. [CLIP: Shere Hite:00:42 \u201cI was very surprised that people didn\u2019t make this connection between women demanding their rights in sex and women demanding their rights in jobs.... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s militant to say that women should have orgasms and that women should be able to stimulate themselves in the same way that men can.\u201d]"

      "text": "Almost 50 years later, the heterosexual orgasm gap remains vast. A 2017 study analyzed survey results and found that 95 percent of heterosexual men regularly orgasm during partnered sexual activity, compared with 65 percent of heterosexual women and 86 percent of lesbian women. The authors noted that lesbian women could be in a better position to understand how different behaviors feel for their partner and that they may be more likely to take turns receiving pleasure until each is satisfied. The researchers also reviewed sociocultural explanations such as people placing a greater importance on male sexual pleasure than female pleasure, as well as a stigma discouraging women from exploring their own sexuality. They concluded the paper by writing, \u201cThe fact that lesbian women orgasmed more often than heterosexual women indicates that many heterosexual women could experience higher rates of orgasm.\u201d The research team behind OMGYES has picked up that thread by focusing on what kind of stimulation is most pleasurable. They\u2019ve named more than 35 techniques based on thousands of interviews with women and have included the percentages of women that find those techniques useful. Many of these are based on solo or partnered masturbation, while others are meant to complement penetration."

And we have data, you know, that 52 percent of American women wanted to tell their partners how sex could be more pleasurable for them but didn\u2019t. And the main reason cited is not wanting to hurt the partner\u2019s feelings. You know, if you\u2019re giving someone a back rub or scratching someone\u2019s back, of course, the person whose back is being scratched knows best where the itch is."

There\u2019s just so many ways that women are expected or socialized to put others before themselves, to make everyone comfortable, to smile. I think the orgasm gap is ... specifically focused and due to our limited definitions of what sex is, right? If sex is penis and vagina penetration, that does not include the clitoris at all\u2026. Female pleasure, female orgasms, for many, it seems unnecessary or challenging, whereas male orgasms are seen as, like, a requirement."
