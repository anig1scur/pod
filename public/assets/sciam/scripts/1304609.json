      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "Yeah, I had a great conversation with Karen Bakker, a professor at the University of British Columbia and a fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Her book explores how researchers are leveraging new tech to understand animal communication even in the burgeoning field of digital bioacoustics."

    {
      "author": "Bushwick",
      "text": "Not quite, but that is similar to how researchers first started trying to communicate with animals in the seventies and eighties, which is to say they attempted to teach the animals human language. But many scientists today have moved away from this human centric approach, and instead they want to understand animal communication on its own terms."
    },
    {
      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "So instead of trying to teach birds to speak English, we're deciphering what they're already saying to each other in birdish or birdese."
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "Right, exactly. This new field of digital bioacoustics uses portable field recorders that are like mini microphones you can put pretty much anywhere--in trees, on mountaintops, even on the backs of whales and birds. They record sound 24/7 and create oodles of data, which is where artificial intelligence comes in. Researchers can apply natural language processing algorithms like the ones used by Google translate to detect patterns in these recordings and begin to decode what animals might be saying to each other."
    },
    {
      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "Wow, that is wild. So what have scientists learned from this so far?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "One of the examples Karen gives in her book is about Egyptian fruit bats. A researcher named Yossi Yovel recorded audio and video of nearly two dozen bats for two and a half months. His team adapted a voice recognition program to analyze 15,000 of the sounds, and then the algorithm correlated specific sounds to certain social interactions in the videos, like fighting over food or jockeying for sleeping positions. So this research, combined with some other related studies, has revealed that bats are capable of complex communication."
    },
    {
      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "All I remember being taught was that bats make high-pitched\u00a0sounds to echolocate as they fly around, but it sounds like there's a lot more to it than that."
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "Yes, definitely. We've learned that bats have what are known as signature calls which act like individual names."

      "author": "Harper",
      "text": "Whoa."

    {
      "author": "Bushwick",

      "text": "What?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick",
      "text": "They have dialects. They argue over food and sleeping positions. They socially distance when they're ill."
    },

      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "Are you serious?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick",
      "text": "Yeah. They're better at it in some ways than we are. So one of the coolest things is that bat mothers use their own version of motherese with their young. So when humans talk to cute little babies, we use motherese. We raise our pitch, you know, like, oh, what a cute little sweet potato. And bats also use a special tone to talk to their young, but they lower their pitch instead...oh, what a cute little sweet potato. This makes the bat babies babble back, and it might help them learn specific\u00a0words or referential sounds the same way that motherese helps human babies acquire language."
    },
    {
      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "That is bonkers. Or I don't know. Is it? Do I just think it is because I've been cotton the trap of thinking that humans are somehow completely different from other animals and we have a, I don't know, uniquely sophisticated way of communicating. Are we learning that we might not be quite as special as we thought?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "Kind of, yeah. This work is raising a lot of important philosophical questions and ethical ones, too. For a long time, philosophers said we would never be able to determine if animals can be said to have language, let alone be able to decipher or speak it. But these new technologies have really changed the game. One thing that Karen said during our interview is that we can't talk to bats, but our computers can. You and I can't hear, let alone keep up with the fast, high-pitched communication between bats. And we certainly can't speak it ourselves, but electronic sensors and speakers can. And with artificial intelligence, we can begin to trace patterns in animal communication that we never could before. People still debate the question of if we can call it animal language, but it's becoming clear that animals have much more complex ways of communicating than we thought before."

      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "Karen also told me the story of a bee researcher named Tim Landgraf. So honeybee communication\u2014very different from our own. They use not just sounds but also the movements of their bodies to speak. So have you heard of the famed waggle dance?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Harper: ",
      "text": "Yeah. Is that the one where the bees shake their fuzzy little butts in different directions? Or explain where to find nectar?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bushwick: ",
      "text": "That's the one. But the waggle dance is just one form of honeybee communication. Landgraf and his team used a combination of natural language processing. Like in the bat study and computer vision, which analyzes imagery, to decipher both the sounds and the wiggles of bee chatter. They're now able to track individual bees and predict the impact of what one bee says to another."

So bees toot [CLIP: Bee toot sound] and quack [CLIP: Bee quack sound] for they have a whooping sound for danger [CLIP: Bee whooping sound]. Piping signals related to swarming [CLIP: Bee piping sound], and they use a hush or stop signal to get the hive to quiet down [CLIP: Bee hush sound]."
