This testing searches a pregnant person\u2019s blood for fragments of DNA that have been shed by the placenta. NIPT is designed to spot chromosomal disorders in the fetus, but in rare cases the blood tests can detect something else: cancer in the parent."},{"author":"","text":"My guest today is Laura Herscher, a genetic counselor and director of student research at the Sarah Lawrence College Joan H. Marks Graduate Program in Human Genetics. She recently wrote a piece for Scientific American about the researchers working to understand how NIPT finds cancer in some pregnant people. She\u2019s here to tell us more about the Incidental Detection of Maternal Neoplasia through Non-invasive Cell-Free DNA Analysis study, or IDENTIFY for short."},{"author":"","text":"Laura, thank you so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"","text":"So you recently wrote about something called the IDENTIFY study. How did you get interested in this story?"},{"author":"Laura Hercher","text":"Well, the first time I heard about IDENTIFY was when the principal investigator, Diana Bianchi from, from [the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development], talked about her initial results, which was just about a year ago\u2014it was, like, March of 2024. And she said that she was looking at something I had heard about, that had crossed my, you know, radar, but I really wasn\u2019t paying that much attention, which was these weird and funky prenatal testing results, which, instead of giving back information on the fetus, unexpectedly provided information on the pregnant individual themselves. And I\u2019d heard, somewhat almost by rumor, from prenatal genetic counselors that sometimes these oddball genetic testing results actually seem to see a signal for cancer in the mom."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"But, you know, most cancer screens, even when they\u2019re set up to be cancer screens, the return on them is usually limited. However, in this case, she reported that they had looked at the first about 100 women that were worked up after getting these unusual results on a test that they thought was on their fetus, and almost exactly half of them had cancer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And you have to consider that this is a group of young individuals because they\u2019re all of childbearing age, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So to see such a strong cancer signal in that population, it really blew me away. So I wanted to know more, and so I investigated into it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. So backing up a little bit, what is the prenatal testing here that we\u2019re talking about, and how common is it? How many pregnant people are, are getting these tests?"},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Millions, so it\u2019s quite common; at least, I would say, about 50 percent of all pregnancies today use this test. It\u2019s called noninvasive prenatal testing\u2014let\u2019s just call it NIPT."},{"author":"","text":"So NIPT is a test that came along that sort of solved a problem from the point of view of expecting couples. The problem was that before NIPT, we offered testing for Down syndrome and other unusual chromosomal presentations in the fetus to essentially every pregnant individual, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"But there were sort of two types of testing. And one was amniocentesis or CVS [chorionic villus sampling], where you use a needle to get a sample from either the placenta or the amniotic fluid in the uterus, and as that probably suggests to people, it\u2019s invasive ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Right? And so, not everyone was comfortable with that. And most importantly, even though it was very small, there was a risk of losing the pregnancy associated with both of those tests. So there were some\u2014and expensive, and it\u2019s a big deal ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And a lot of people would rather avoid that needle if they could."},{"author":"","text":"And there was another type of test, which was simply a blood test from [the] pregnant person, that looked at biomarkers associated with various chromosomal issues in the fetus. And that was an easy test and cheap but had tons of false positives."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And in fact, you know, when I was first in this field and would see prenatal patients, they\u2019d come in with a positive biomarker screen, and you could be quite reassuring \u2019cause, like, the chances were usually\u2014always greater than not ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"That it was nothing, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So that\u2019s nice, but also, it means that a lot of people get agitated, have follow-up care, and so on, and turn out that it\u2019s nothing. It wasn\u2019t super popular, you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"There was a push to look for a test that would find fetal cells in the maternal bloodstream ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So you could directly look at the fetal DNA, but you wouldn\u2019t have to get into the uterus in any fashion."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Really, that\u2019s never turned out to be possible. It\u2019s very complicated. It\u2019s difficult. There\u2019s been sort of tantalizing hints, but no, it\u2019s never been successful as a test. But what a Hong Kong\u2013based researcher realized was that, you know, as cells die\u2014in normal course of cell death, as cells turn over, they dump little bits of DNA into the bloodstream."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"That\u2019s not when you\u2019re pregnant\u2014that\u2019s for everybody all the time."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And this gets very rapidly cleaned up, recycled. So\u2014and that DNA isn\u2019t nice and neatly contained in chromosomes; it\u2019s chopped up into little pieces like a jigsaw puzzle ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Which\u2014it\u2019s good to hold on to that image, right? And you can sequence those little pieces and then trace them back to what chromosome they came from by using the knowledge we have of the human genome like it was the picture on the cover of the box ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"When you\u2019re doing a jigsaw puzzle, right? So you can trace it right back and figure out, \u201cOh, this little segment came from chromosome one; this little segment came from chromosome 10,\u201d and so on. And those pieces should show up in the bloodstream in direct proportion to the size of the chromosome. So chromosome one is the biggest chromosome, so it should have the most pieces, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Like, that\u2019s just math. Like, if you get a good sample, that\u2019s what the sample should look like, from the biggest to the smallest chromosome."},{"author":"","text":"So if you\u2019re pregnant, a portion of that cell-free DNA, those little pieces, comes from the placenta."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So what [Hong Kong\u2013based researcher Dennis] Lo figured out was that you didn\u2019t need to disentangle the fetal DNA from the maternal DNA, which is super complicated, in order to get a sense of whether the numbers were off because you could just assume that the maternal snippets of DNA would represent typical chromosomes because you know that person\u2019s chromosomes."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And so any deviation from the expected numbers should be coming from the fetus. So it\u2019s super hard math. Like, it\u2019s\u2014you really have to be very precise. But the idea of it\u2019s pretty straightforward, right? And it mostly works. But what it means is: there\u2019s fewer\u2014not zero, it\u2019s still a screen\u2014but there\u2019s fewer false positives."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s really quick, the adoption of this test\u2014goes from zero to millions very, very fast. And then right away, rarely but regularly, we start seeing this funny thing. The funny thing [is] results where you\u2019re seeing a signal of extra missing chromosomes\u2014not one but multiple and you look at this report, and it\u2019s supposed to be a report on ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Fetal chromosomes, and you\u2019re like, \u201cThis fetus should not be alive.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"\u201cThis is not compatible with life.\u201d And yet you look at the ultrasound, and there you have a happily developing fetus\u2014looks fine, looks normal. It is what the doctors call \u201cdiscordant,\u201d right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"It doesn\u2019t make any sense. So we didn\u2019t know\u2014quite know what to make of them, and the lab started off by just sort of saying, like, \u201cWe\u2019re turning you these results; we don\u2019t understand them.\u201d They came to call them \u201cnonreportable\u201d ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Which is different from sort of a \u201ctest fail\u2014let\u2019s do it over.\u201d These were like, \u201cNope, don\u2019t do it over. This just doesn\u2019t work. Something\u2019s off.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And they didn\u2019t know, but then they started to have, you know, incidental findings where the doctors would come back and say, \u201cLook, six months ago I had this person come in, and they had these nonreportable results, and now I hear that this person has cancer.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And at first it was just the occasional anecdote, which, you know, you can\u2019t really send a report based on an occasional anecdote. So over time they started looking into this; it became clearer that what we were getting was a signal, not from the fetus but from the mother. And it was happening not often but one in every 8,000 to 10,000 cases\u2014which, when you have millions of tests a year, is really quite a number of people."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, it sounds like, you know, it was a long process to sort of turn the anecdata into a signal that was worth pursuing. How did the researchers in charge of this study get really interested and figure out what was going on?"},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Well, Diana Bianchi, who\u2019s the principal investigator, is somebody who\u2019s been working with this test, NIPT, really from its very beginning. And I think what Dr. Bianchi found was that there were some studies showing a pretty intriguing signal of cancer, but some of them were from the labs themselves. In the United States you have multiple labs\u2014you have, like, 12 different labs that offer NIPT. Each one is slightly different. They\u2019re not exactly the same. And so it was hard to get, like, one simple answer. And without a simple answer you can send a report back saying, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about maternal malignancy,\u201d but is the insurance company gonna pay for that?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"It\u2019s not validated. And also, like, were the doctors gonna take it seriously? They hadn\u2019t seen it before. Like, there was a lot of ways for this not to be used properly ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"This information to get lost."},{"author":"","text":"So this group at [the National Institutes of Health] said, like, \u201cRight, okay, we\u2019re gonna do an objective study.\u201d Anybody that fits those criteria\u2014discordant results\u2014that person, they would pay all of their expenses to come to NIH, they would give them a full and total workup, and that would allow them to see how many of them actually, if any, had cancer; what was the effective way of finding it; what type of cancers were these; so on\u2014all these questions\u2014and provide guidance for the labs."},{"author":"","text":"And they thought they were gonna find something, but what Dr. Bianchi said to me\u2014so I said, \u201cWere you surprised by how many?\u201d She said, \u201cHell yeah, we were surprised.\u201d I mean, almost half. And if you actually looked at it closely it said in the paper that they could further refine the signal. So when the women showed up and they actually had more than two full chromosomes missing or added, I think the numbers were 49 of them had this pattern ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"And 47 of those people had cancer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So that was [a] really, really strong signal, but even in the bigger group, you know, they were seeing. And there were other things: Sometimes people had fibroids. Sometimes the test was wrong, and, you know. Sometimes there were other things. Sometimes there\u2019s people that they think, like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know. We gotta follow those people out. Maybe we just can\u2019t find it yet,\u201d you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"But really a lot of them already had cancer, and essentially they either had no symptoms or they had symptoms that were easily mistaken for pregnancy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right. Something that really struck me in your piece was\u2014and I\u2019m definitely oversimplifying this\u2014but you got into sort of the idea that in medicine people are very uncomfortable about the idea of pregnant people with cancer and it\u2019s a very fraught topic and how maybe that contributed somewhat to the disconnect between the many pieces here as this data was coming together. Could you talk a little bit more about that?"},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Sure, I think there\u2019s different pieces to it. One is simply, as Dr. Bianchi said, there\u2019s sort of a lot of history around the idea of, like, \u201cDon\u2019t touch pregnant people,\u201d you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"It\u2019s not comfortable. And, you know, medicine\u2019s quite siloed, so the OB-GYN\u2019s not super comfortable having patients who have cancer or might have cancer. How does he work that up? It really requires them to go out and find oncologists who they would be able to explain this to, right?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Because this isn\u2019t some way that some\u2014you know, show up and they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, they have no symptoms.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"\u201cThere\u2019s no particular reason except I have this funky test result, and we have no idea what cancer this might be.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s a very odd presentation ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Right? And the oncologists are obviously not used to working with pregnant people."},{"author":"","text":"We talked to one person who had this experience\u2014I talked to one woman who showed up for her prenatal results session, and the geneticist she was talking to said, \u201cWell, actually, you know, we think this signal is coming from you.\u201d And she almost didn\u2019t follow up on it because, she said, \u201cI felt great.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"\u201cI actually, you know, had never been in better shape in my life. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m fine. Like, I thought you were gonna say there\u2019s something about the fetus.\u2019\u201d And the person kind of said, \u201cLook, go get the workup.\u201d So she did. And to her shock and horror they found a fairly large and aggressive lymphoma, and she had to be treated during her pregnancy. She had her last chemotherapy treatment two weeks before she gave birth, and she said that she was really lucky because in Washington, [D.C.], she was able to find a, a center where they could do coordinated care. And for her that meant that, you know, OB would send somebody over every time she had an infusion to just check on the baby\u2019s heartbeat, make sure it was okay. You know, there was constant communication back and forth. And obviously not everybody\u2019s going to have that available, and it can be scary and uncomfortable."},{"author":"","text":"Beyond that there\u2019s a whole other layer of this story, which is that people who discover their\u2014have cancer during a pregnancy, there are times when appropriate care means discussing terminating the pregnancy because that may result in a better outcome. That doesn\u2019t mean that they have to do it or they\u2019re\u2014that\u2019s the option they\u2019re gonna choose, but in the situation where best outcomes are associated with treatment that can only be undertaken if a person is not pregnant ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Then that\u2019s a discussion the oncologist needs to have. But that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019ve seen, since 2022, that exceptions are really challenging in stringent antiabortion laws."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Because very often the doctor is caught in a bind where the standard of care would be to present that as one of the options, but the law may say you\u2019re not allowed to present that as an option unless the person is literally dying, and, you know, in oncology that\u2019s not the way that\u2019s gonna look. What\u2019s it gonna look like is: What are your chances of being alive in five years? What are your chances of being alive to raise this child?"},{"author":"","text":"And so the laws weren\u2019t written by the doctors, they don\u2019t really have a lot of flexibility or nuance in them, and in those cases oncologists can be really in a bind. And so this test, which doesn\u2019t identify, you know\u2014there\u2019s not more people getting cancer because of the test, but what it\u2019s really doing is: the early identification is moving people that would maybe be diagnosed with cancer a month, two months, six months, two years later, that\u2019s happening earlier on and while they\u2019re pregnant."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So it just creates more of these sort of difficult and conflictual situations."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and, you know, with the average age of pregnancy being higher and, of course, seeing these upticks in cancer in, in younger cohorts, you know, is there concern that this is an issue we need to get better at handling in, in general? The idea of people having cancers diagnosed during pregnancy?"},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, all over the world, the average age at which people have children is increasing, and, you know, cancer\u2019s a\u2014direct, in a linear fashion, associated with older age. So we do have more\u2014our numbers of what percentage of women who are pregnant will present with cancer are out-of-date. So it\u2019s definitely a rare thing, but it\u2019s an increasing rare thing."},{"author":"","text":"And the other thing, which Dr. Bianchi really stressed, is: we are also getting better at being able to treat people while they\u2019re pregnant."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"We can do more of it than we thought. She told me\u2014I thought this was really striking\u2014she told me that, particularly, there was a group in Belgium that\u2019s been very active about looking at this and, like, being creative about the ways to treat, and one of the problems they have is the dye that you use when you do this test to look for tumors, the contrast dye, was toxic for people who are pregnant, and they found that by getting them to drink a whole lot of pineapple juice, that worked as well ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"So, you know, they\u2019re finding that things that maybe they thought they couldn\u2019t do, they really can do, and it really, really emphasizes the need to not lose these people ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"To make sure that they are found when they can be found. I mean, a number that really stuck with me from this: of those 47 individuals with cancer, by the time they went to press with this article, six of those\u2014remember, relatively young\u2014people were dead."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Yeah, so these were not a series of trivial or meaningless findings. The most common finding was lymphoma. The second-most common finding was [colorectal] cancer, which, separately but relatedly, is on the rise in younger adults in America today."},{"author":"","text":"So there are a lot of trends kind of, like, weaving their way in and out of this story. It was one of the ones that I found it so interesting to write about. It\u2019s an important finding on its own, but it\u2019s also something you have to situate within the context of what\u2019s happening in the United States, right? And it, it asks us to, you know, work outside of silos and be really smart and really, you know intervene, and it\u2019s yet another thing where I\u2019m worried about the fractures in our health care. \u2019Cause right now they had an answer, they have resources for people in this position ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"They\u2019re like, \u201cYou should go to the IDENTIFY study.\u201d They will fly you to NIH, cover all of your costs. But when the study goes away how many of these people are gonna have to really fight with their insurance companies ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"To get this covered? And if not, is it just gonna be, you know, like, if you have money to pay for it out of pocket, are you going to be able to get this care but otherwise not, you know?"},{"author":"","text":"So I really wanna shine some light on this. I hope that people see the importance of, A, responding to these findings with an appropriate workup and, B, that they should be covered."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for taking the time to come on and, and tell us a little bit about your article. I definitely encourage our, our listeners to check it out in full on SciAm.com."},{"author":"Hercher","text":"Thanks, it was a pleasure to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
