Today we\u2019ve got a show in two acts exploring how studies can make us so overconfident that we lose sight of the underlying uncertainty."},{"author":"Act 1: The Backfire Effect","text":"Back in 2011 I gave a short talk at a journalism conference about what I had learned from hate mail. The bottom line, I said, was that if you tell people that they\u2019re wrong about something they hold dear, they will immediately get defensive. And if you\u2019re a journalist like me, they will send you nasty letters like the ones you heard at the top of the show. I based my argument on my own personal experience having written about things like climate change and cancer screening and, most controversially, the uselessness of multivitamins."},{"author":"Act 1: The Backfire Effect","text":"But I also backed it up with science\u2014specifically, some research by Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. Here\u2019s how I explained it in the talk: Here\u2019s Brendan Nyhan."},{"author":"Brendan Nyhan","text":"After I had graduated from college, I had worked as one of the founders of a nonpartisan fact-checking website called Spinsanity that was one of the original online fact-checkers. And we ran from 2001 to 2004. And that ended up putting us in the middle of the first of the war in Iraq and the aftermath of 9/11 in the conspiracy theories around that."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Oh, yes, the 9/11 conspiracies. There were a lot of those!"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Then you fast-forward to the end of the Bush administration\u2014Barack Obama is running for president; the Obama Muslim myth starts spreading. That becomes a very salient misperception. The first two years of the Obama administration, we have the Affordable Care Act. So the death panels myth is a hugely influential policy misperception, and the Obama Muslim myth morphs into the birther myth."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So people like you are trying to correct these misperceptions and not getting much traction."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"People were trying to understand \u201cWhy are these so prominent?\u201d and \u201cWhy are our efforts to fight these not working?\u201d"},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Your studies used undergraduates as test subjects. What was the setup?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Each of the studies involved a mock news article about a salient political misperception. The experiment was whether that mock news article randomly included corrective information debunking the claim made by the featured political elite or not."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"What kinds of misperceptions were you testing?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"So, for instance, there\u2019s, an example in the article is George W. Bush suggesting that his tax cut will reduce the deficit rather than increase it [CLIP: President George W. Bush Presidential Radio Address, 2001: This pas week I\u2019ve been making the case for tax reductions. I\u2019ve asked Congress to act quickly on my tax relief plan, so that Americans can face these uncertain economic times with more of their own money.\u201d]"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Which is a finding that\u2014even his own economists held that his claims were not accurate."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So one group would be told that, well, actually, the Bush administration\u2019s own economists say the tax cut will increase the deficit by many millions of dollars."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"That was an experimental variation: Are you being exposed to that corrective information or not?"},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"And you found that people exposed to the corrective information, what we might now call a fact-check, actually ended up becoming more sure of the misperception rather than correcting it."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"The finding was that two of the five studies we conducted showed evidence of this backfire effect. Our interpretation, when asked, was that people might be thinking about reasons they held a belief in the first place and coming to double down on them as a result of being corrected."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"I loved the backfire effect! It felt so true and resonated so much with my personal experience. I was positive that this finding explained everything in the same way that I was sure that the dress from our previous episode was white and gold."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"That finding turned out to be a real brain worm for all of us. It resonated with people\u2019s experiences, like yours, in reminding people of the times when they\u2019ve struggled to convince someone who seemed even more sure of their original belief. And we can all think of examples like that ... and as a result, it just resonated, and as we told, then retold the story in the way humans do, the scientific nuance was lost."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"It felt so true\u2014like it didn\u2019t need nuance."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"I think you\u2019re an extremely careful scientific journalist. So it\u2019s not a criticism of you in any way."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Well, thank you. That\u2019s very kind."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"But it\u2019s like, as I tell the story, and then you tell the story, and, right, and as it propagates out there into the world..., we totally lost control of how it was described over time, and it just spread everywhere. And, well..., there really wasn\u2019t better evidence, right? This was the study I\u2019d conducted. And I reported what I found. And I described my best interpretation of it from a scientific perspective."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Let\u2019s take a moment to step back and take a closer look at what\u2019s happening here. Brendan\u2019s group got some really intriguing data, but those are just raw results. The human brain doesn\u2019t think in data; we think in stories. So he and his colleagues did what all scientists do\u2014they created a story to explain their data. To do that, they had to do some interpretation and bring human judgment to bear. Let\u2019s listen again to what Brendan said a moment ago:"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Our interpretation, when asked, was that people might be thinking about reasons they held a belief in the first place and coming to double down on them as a result of being corrected."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Notice that? He said \u201cpeople might be thinking about reasons they held the belief.\u201d Because he\u2019s a careful scientist, Brendan was cautious here to say that this is a possible explanation. But it\u2019s really just a guess, and he\u2019s pretty careful not to overstate it. Whether or not the result itself holds up, this explanation of it is a hypothesis. We can think of it as a \u201cjust-so story.\u201d Rudyard Kipling\u2019s classic collection of Just So Stories For Little Children provides fanciful explanations for things like how leopards got their spots and how camels got their humps."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Just-so stories are tales invented to explain observed phenomena, just like the explanations scientists present for their scientific results are invented to explain the data. Until they\u2019re tested, these stories are just best guesses. But because these explanations are created to perfectly fit the data, it\u2019s easy to jump on the story and forget about all the uncertainty that surrounds it. As it turns out, the backfire effect is a classic case of a very exciting first finding that we all jump on, and then, poof, it disappears in later studies."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Of course, it\u2019s important to note that only two of the five original experiments found any evidence of the backfire effect. So there was a lot of uncertainty about it from the very first study."},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Since then many other studies have been done by myself and my co-authors and by many other scholars finding the backfire effects seem to be exceptionally rare."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"But by now the genie is out of the bottle, and those follow-up studies never get as much media attention as the first time, right?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Those unfortunately don\u2019t get the same kind of play."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"I feel like this is a little bit meta, right? You were presented with evidence that your original finding on the backfire effect might not hold up, and instead of doubling down, you\u2019ve actually opened up and said, \u201cWait a second; let\u2019s revisit this. Let\u2019s put all the evidence together.\u201d"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"Yeah, and you know, I\u2019m grateful to all the people who interacted with me in a good-faith manner. And I think that helps us all be better people in having these kinds of exchanges, right? It never became personal; it never became vitriolic. And that helped, I think, keep the focus on the science in a way that helped me, hopefully, you know, respond in a more, in an appropriate way."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"It\u2019s kind of the idealized version of how scientists should behave. I can easily imagine a different universe where you double down, and you maybe give a TED Talk and write a pop-science book about the power of the backfire effect. Instead you published a paper titled \u201cWhy the Backfire Effect Does Not Explain the Durability of Political Misperceptions.\u201d"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"It\u2019s a great reminder that we don\u2019t have all the answers. I think it\u2019s really changed how I think about science and how I do science."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"How has it changed the way you operate?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"I hope it\u2019s helped me approach this question with more humility because I had many preregistered studies at that point."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Oh, right, preregistered studies are experiments where you lay out and commit to a specific plan. You commit to how you will carry out the study and analyze the results before you begin. This is meant to reduce the temptation to fiddle around with the analysis once the results start coming in. So what have these studies found?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"The findings were clear that correct information did tend to reduce perceived accuracy of false claims, somewhat, right? And I had plenty of preregistered studies in which I had found exactly that."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So does the backfire effect really exist?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"You know, I wasn\u2019t finding evidence of pervasive or substantial backfire effects, either."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Since that talk 13 years ago, I\u2019ve thought a lot about the backfire effect and what it says about science and how we know what\u2019s true. One thing that\u2019s become clear to me is that it\u2019s really easy to get a result. You did a study, and you found this thing. It\u2019s a lot harder to get an answer to the underlying question. When I was giving that talk about the backfire effect, I was trying to explain why people resist changing their beliefs when they are offered a correction. I really wanted a universal answer."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"But that\u2019s asking for a lot. Were we expecting too much from the backfire effect?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"It came to stand in for why this social phenomenon exists, right? And no scientific research could bear the weight of the demand for monocausal explanations for complex social problems. And this one certainly couldn\u2019t."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"We want a single answer that explains everything, but maybe there isn\u2019t one. I like to joke that the most scientific answer to any question is \u201cit depends.\u201d"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"I think there\u2019s a learning opportunity for everyone, certainly, you know, learning opportunity for me as a scientist\u2014I\u2019ve done my very best in my own research to follow up on this study, to not let it be the last word, to publicize the emerging body of evidence that better represents the scientific consensus as time has gone on. And I think maybe most importantly I\u2019ve tried to not be defensive about my own study because, you know, \u201cWhat kind of a researcher on misinformation would I be if I wasn\u2019t willing to change my mind when the facts change?\u201d"},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"That\u2019s really noble of you, but we\u2019re all human. It\u2019s easy to feel defensive. How do you move away from the desire to be right toward a goal of finding the right answer?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"I\u2019ve gone on to work on a number of studies with [political scientists] Ethan Porter and Tom Wood, who\u2019ve done some of the most important follow-up research in this area. And we\u2019ve worked together collaboratively \u2026 instead of having one of these adversarial scientific disputes where each side says the other is wrong, we\u2019ve forged a path to try to move the research literature in a more informative direction."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"What lessons can we take from the backfire effect saga?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"The single splashy study lends itself to media coverage, right? It\u2019s what the big general-interest science journals look for. But sometimes studies are surprising precisely because they don\u2019t correspond to prior knowledge."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Should we be more skeptical of really surprising findings?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"We should be cautious that they may be anomalous, right? And our study turned out to be anomalous. I don\u2019t know of an error we made. It\u2019s science. It\u2019s\u2014our findings are provisional and subject to being overturned."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"This harkens to the hidden moderators we talked about in our previous episode\u2014those unremarkable decisions that researchers make that may end up having a big influence on the results they get. Has this experience changed the way you approach study design?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"There are a number of factors that I would do very differently now, with, you know, the knowledge of more than 15 years since we conducted those studies. I guess what\u2019s important to take away is: it doesn\u2019t have to be wrong in the sense of it was conducted fraudulently or incorrectly. It can just be one data point among many."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So a lesson here is to be careful about putting too much weight on a single study. It\u2019s easy to focus on the exciting or surprising finding and forget about all the other ones that may be less interesting. Here a lot of people\u2014including me!\u2014overlooked the fact that from the very start, the backfire effect was an outlier\u2014it only showed up in two of the five experiments. Brendan, how has this experience influenced the way you evaluate studies?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"We interrogate the science that we discuss in my classes. I encourage the students to take apart the methodology of the research, the assumptions that the authors make, the flaws in their experimental designs.... I try to foster the kind of critical scientific inquiry that I try to practice as a scientist in my teaching in the classroom."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"You\u2019re a political scientist. How does an understanding of uncertainty factor into our political system?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"We are coming into contact with lots of studies that are being offered as evidence for various kinds of policies and interventions. And I think learning about the uncertainty and science and the value of high-quality science, as well as the uncertainty inherent in the process, right, and to be able to hold those both in our heads at the same time is a really important part of hopefully being a leader in this country in the 21st century."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So putting this all together, what does this tell us about science?"},{"author":"Nyhan","text":"It\u2019s an imperfect human process with many flaws. But it\u2019s an incredibly powerful one for learning about the world. It\u2019s the best way we know how to learn about the world. And I think we can keep what\u2019s great about science while also remembering it\u2019s highly provisional in nature. If we can strike that balance, it can do great things."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Oh, I love your optimism! Today\u2019s episode of Uncertain is about the ways that studies can leave us overconfident. We just heard about how \u201cjust-so stories\u201d can make us feel overly certain about results that are still a work in progress. And now we\u2019ve now arrived at ... Act 2: The problem with scientists."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Sometimes studies get misleading results because of random error or weird samples or study design. But sometimes science gets things wrong because it\u2019s done by humans, and humans are fallible and imperfect. No matter how much we like to think that science is impartial, the truth is: human preferences and values influence how science is done. And that means cultural factors and embedded prejudices can sway the results that studies produce. Someone who knows a lot about this is Brandon Ogbunu. Yeah, I know. This episode had a Brendan in our first act; now we\u2019ve got Brandon."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Don\u2019t let it confuse you. Brendan is the political scientist. Brandon is a biologist. Here\u2019s Brandon."},{"author":"C. Brandon Ogbunu","text":"I\u2019m an assistant professor at department of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Brandon has given a lot of thought to scientific authority. He grew up with a lot of respect for scientists."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I was raised with this appreciation for scientific, quote, unquote, \u201cideas,\u201d and certainly people who did it, and I think that is because of the great things that scientists accomplish, and, you know, going to the moon and drugs for diseases and the engineering breakthroughs of the last century. And so, I had this very, very positive view of science."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"How did this play into your views on uncertainty? Was there a moment in your career or your education where you fully came to grips with the importance of uncertainty to science?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"Well, I\u2019m cheating a bit here, but, I think every time I talk in the media, I have to talk about my mother because she\u2019s the center of gravity for all of me. All of these ideas, like certainty or merit, or all these institutions, to me, never made sense, right? And it\u2019s because I was raised by an African American woman who is smarter than anybody in my department, now. She just didn\u2019t have the opportunity."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"So the notion that life gives people a chance based on merit and you just work hard, work hard, and you\u2019ll get with work\u2014that\u2019s never been true ever, right? Because I saw somebody brilliant and hardworking get nothing but barriers put up her whole life. She knew what she was talking about more than most people. And again, challenges, challenges, challenges, challenges, challenges\u2014I\u2019ve seen her be right 100 times, and still high school administrators or whoever, landlords or whoever we were dealing with at the time be wrong, and they win."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"That\u2019s soul-crushing. How did that influence your view of scientific authority?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"So the notion that, like, that the world is supposed to work a certain way was never right with me, I think for me\u2014and that\u2019s tied to the African American experience in America."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Right."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"It was, like, all of these voices of authority told us where we were supposed to be in society and what we were supposed to be doing and how we couldn\u2019t go to school. And so that\u2019s never worked. And I think, certainly the gospel of certainty, that\u2019s another kind of authority, right? And I think\u2014so my point is, I\u2019ve never really entered science that way."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So how do you think of science now?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I think as I\u2019ve matured, just as a person, and have become a, you know, a member of the scientific workforce, I think both my appreciation for science has grown and become much more nuanced\u2014and I mean my love of it, in a very positive sense, and my understanding of its flaws and its major problems and pitfalls and challenges."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So you love science despite its shortcomings."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I appreciate, in many more ways, the power of it and what makes it beautiful. And I understand the challenges and the damaging aspects of, you know, the damage that it can cause."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"What do you mean when you say the damage it can cause?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"On one end, we mean that the products of science can be damaging, right? So, you know, we talk about the bomb; we\u2019re talking about biological weapons."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Right, the products of science can be very harmful, and in those two cases, they were actually created specifically to cause damage."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"The much more pernicious, but simultaneously more violent way, is the ideas."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So you mean some of the actual ideas and theories that science puts out? I\u2019m thinking here of eugenics."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"You can\u2019t look at, like, the eugenics movement and say, \u201cOh, well, that was just a fringe thing.\u201d Like, no, it wasn\u2019t. That was the field. That was the way the mainstream thought."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"For instance, Thomas Jefferson\u2026"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"\u2026 was the preeminent polymath of his time. He was a technical and evidence-based and profoundly scientific thinker for his time."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"What is the lesson we should take from this?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"When the process for all of the reasons doesn\u2019t have to pay attention to the way social influences or biases or power are influencing the types of things we\u2019re asking and how we\u2019re asking them, science can get things shockingly wrong. It can lead us down really, really bad, incorrect paths that ended up causing harm."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"How does science get these bad ideas to begin with?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"It can be because other interests, biases that you may not see\u2014your own and society\u2019s\u2014infiltrate the process and steer the process in order to try to get to a product that we oftentimes find out was based on a broken idea."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"We think that science is objective, but you\u2019re arguing that in fact, we\u2019re bringing our human biases to bear here. Even the nature of the question we\u2019re asking is not objective, right?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"The term bias doesn\u2019t even necessarily mean bad or harmful. It means that you are a person..., a sentient individual who has experienced things on the Earth.... There is no way that is not going to influence the manner that you do your work, from me writing my manuscripts in English, right? Let\u2019s just start there. Not only does that influence to whom I\u2019m speaking, it influences the shape and the manner that I describe certain ideas because languages have different means of describing things."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"So you\u2019re saying that scientists need to look for and acknowledge the limitations of their work?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I report the limits of my work, for me. I think that is the responsible way to do science. But that stands out to people. And they\u2019re like, \u201cWait a minute; what are you doing? Why would you be pointing out the flaws in your own work, Brandon? Is that imposter syndrome?\u201d No, it\u2019s not imposter syndrome. It\u2019s me being a responsible scientist."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"I\u2019ve heard a lot of talk within the scientific community in recent years about making it easier for scientists to correct course or issue retractions without undue penalty. Should we think of being wrong as the occasional price of being ambitious and creative?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"Oftentimes, it\u2019s not about the proportion of times that you\u2019re right. It\u2019s what you are right about.... In fact, many of the people who are right about important things were wrong about many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many other things."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Ok [laughs] you\u2019re saying there are a lot of cases where scientists have been wrong. And we tend to focus on the correct ideas and forget the ones we abandoned."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I had this ambition to give a seminar where I talk exclusively about things I was wrong about and why. When I do that, frankly, that will be a sign of my eminence ..."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Because you can boldly profess your wrongness without losing your credibility."},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"Admitting that you\u2019re wrong and explaining what you got wrong is actually a demonstration of your power, knowledge and authority, and demonstrating the wrongness and what you\u2019ve learned is precisely what makes science the greatest knowledge-creation instrument in the history of the universe."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"How do you balance wrongness with authority?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"Look, I\u2019m an arrogant professor, like everybody else is. I\u2019m not modest. I think I\u2019m right about things. I\u2019m not saying you should expect to be wrong or try to be wrong. But if you are, just say so and explain to us why you\u2019re wrong and what we can learn because being wrong is a critical part to building the understanding."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Does the public need a better understanding of the provisional nature of science and the way that being wrong is a natural part of the process?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"I believe it\u2019s the only way science is going to survive as an institution\u2014is if we start to actually lay bare and make transparent all of these dimensions of the way that it works. Uncertainty is not a sign of a problem. Uncertainty is oftentimes a feature of the way we\u2019re studying the natural world. Uncertainty will be a part of virtually every natural system in the universe. The question is: How do we change that uncertainty? How do we inform the parameters of that uncertainty?"},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"What\u2019s your parting takeaway? What should the public know about uncertainty and science?"},{"author":"Ogbunu","text":"So the idea is we need to disabuse ourselves of certainty even being a goal. The goal is understanding the world, and understanding can exist with accumulated uncertainties that science is kind of informing and tuning with our data."},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"Let go of the need for certainty. That seems like good life advice, too. [CLIP: Music sting]"},{"author":"Aschwanden","text":"We\u2019ve spent much of today\u2019s episode exploring how easy it is for us to fall a little too in love with our ideas, which is problematic when they turn out to be wrong. And the history of science is full of ideas that were not quite right or even dead wrong. But science has also illuminated many useful truths about the universe, and there are some things that scientists can do to point themselves in that direction."},{"author":"Brian Nosek","text":"The way that we phrase it is that the priority for researchers should be on getting it right, not being right. The notion that I have to be right means that I need to take a defensive tact when you find a flaw. The prioritization of getting it right means that if you say: \u201cI think I see something wrong with your research,\u201d I should say: \u201cReally? What is it? Tell me because my goal is to make sure it is right.\u201d On the next episode of Uncertain, we\u2019ll talk to scientists who are working on being less wrong."},{"author":"Brian Nosek","text":"Uncertain is produced by me, Christie Aschwanden, and Jeff DelViscio.
