And today, we\u2019re going to get a glimpse of the first light to shine through that window\u2026"

The image had to be seen to be believed--and on that day, it was everywhere to see and ponder, from the big screen in Times Square to trillions of small screens across the world. But, what if you are physically unable to see it?\u00a0"

Most stars appear blue, and are sometimes as large as more distant galaxies that appear next to them. A very bright star is just above and left of center. It has eight bright blue, long diffraction spikes."

      "text": "That's Claire Blome, principal science writer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, the operations center for the Webb telescope. And ALT text, as you might have gathered, is an official way to describe, and make accessible, the contents of an image to someone that might not be able to see it with their eyes.\u00a0 In 2020, it was estimated that over a billion people on earth live with vision impairment. That\u2019s according to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. So, if many millions around the world were following the news of Webb\u2019s first image, the number of viewers who couldn\u2019t actually view it was likely significant. That image\u2019s ALT text has likely been heard by multitudes. But ALT Text can go further than just visual description. It can even add context to an infographic or a graph that might not be clear to all that take it in, whether by looking at it, or listening to it described. At its best, ALT text also helps\u2026"

      "text": "For me, it's a bit of awe first, but then, okay, that's the hook now you're into this. Let me tell you what's here. So then being able to describe, for example, the star at the center of a planetary Nebula, and then describing the scene of gas and dust around it, you know, being able to compare it to, you know, wispy or translucent fabrics.  Even if somebody hasn't seen fabric blowing in the wind, they perhaps have felt it and understand the differences in the weights of fabrics. But either way, the goal is to paint a picture with the writing to be complete, to provide the whole as much as possible. It\u2019s not a one to one, but it\u2019s providing someone that same in-depth experience\u2013that opportunity.\u00a0"

The mid-infrared image appears much darker with many fewer points of light. Stars have very short diffraction spikes. Galaxies and stars also appear in a range of colors, including blue, green, yellow, and red. The near infrared image appears busier with many more points of. Thousands of galaxies and stars appear all across this view. They're sharper and more distinct than what is seen in the mid-infrared view. Some galaxies are shades of orange while others are white. Most stars appear blue with long diffraction spikes, forming an eight-pointed star shape. There are also many thin, long orange arcs that curve around the center of the image."

      "text": "The background is deep blue with scattered points of light of different size and brightness running from left to right through the middle is a jagged line representing a light spectrum, a graph of brightness versus wavelength of light. The area below the spectrum has a rainbow pattern from red on the left to purple on the right. The coloring is semi-transparent. The blue starry background is visible behind, and fades out toward the bottom. In the middle, superimposed on the star background and part of the spectrum, is a large hexagon outlined in gold with two hexagonal outlines. Within the hexagon is an illustration of space with shapes representing objects and materials at different distances and points in time that Webb is investigating. A large planet with hints of cloud formation. Beams of matter, jetting out from the center of a galaxy. Galaxies of different shapes and sizes, nebulous, cloudy, widths, and stars with eight pointed diffraction patterns."
