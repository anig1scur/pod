This award celebrates those who are making a patient\u2019s experience as easy as possible during an extraordinarily difficult time. In 2021, the non-profit Unite for HER received the award for its work funding integrative therapies like acupuncture, massage and nutrition support for women who\u2019ve been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. As we prepared for this year\u2019s awards, we reconnected with Unite for HER\u2019s founder and CEO, Sue Weldon, to hear more about what\u2019s happened since her organization received the award. Sue Weldon, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. I\u2019m really excited to hear more about what you\u2019ve been doing in the past year."},{"author":"Sue Weldon","text":": Aw, thank you for having us. It\u2019s been quite a year. You guys really springboarded us on this wonderful nationwide expansion as well. So I\u2019m happy to share."},{"author":"Hall","text":": Do you mind, for people who don\u2019t know your story, just giving us a brief summary of your own cancer journey?"},{"author":"Weldon","text":": Yeah, absolutely. So in 2004, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was at a time where I had three small children and definitely felt they had the wrong girl, like a lot of people diagnosed. There was a lot of side effects and symptoms that occur during cancer treatment. As a young woman, when you\u2019re going through chemotherapy, you\u2019re sort of forced into this menopause. So I was having hot flashes every hour, on the hour. I wanted to have more children. I was emotionally depressed. I was in bone pain, neuropathy, all the things that come along with treatment itself. That\u2019s where I was learning how to treat the patient who was myself, and that whole woman, to get through. It was life changing for me. It just allowed me to really dive in and educate myself about integrative care, acupuncture, oncology massage, reiki, yoga. Nutrition was huge for me. Food became my medicine and something I could control. These were things I could control. The diagnosis, the treatment, I couldn\u2019t control any of that. That\u2019s really how it all came about.\u00a0 I remember being about a year out and feeling better. Six months of chemotherapy, bilateral mastectomy. It was a rough go. Lost a lot of weight. I was just getting myself back. Hair\u2019s coming back and I went to this event. It was Yoga on the Steps down in Philadelphia. I saw this young woman out the corner of my eye and I can see her face because she reminded me of myself. Her hair was gone and the yellowish skin and the hollow eyes. We all know that feeling.\u00a0 I remember that feeling, that blank stare that I had when I couldn\u2019t believe it was me. So I went up to her and I shared. She asked how I looked so good and what did I do. We just had this connection. And when I share with her about the acupuncture and the yoga, meditation, the whole-food nutrition and plant-based diet, she started crying. She\u2019s like, \u201cOh, well good for you. I could never afford all that.\u201d That was my moment. That was the moment where I was like, oh my gosh, shame on me.\u00a0 This is where we can make an impact. How can we get these types of therapies to everyone to get access? So I went home and said, \u201cHoney, all right. We\u2019re going to start a non-profit. I\u2019m not quite sure what it looks like, we\u2019re all going to work for free for a while.\u201d But I want to make sure that we could be able to give and fund and deliver these types of integrative services. It started with 23 women in 2010, 2009, 2010. Had to have a fundraiser. Now we\u2019re serving over 3,500 women all across the nation."},{"author":"Hall","text":": Let\u2019s say I am a woman who was just diagnosed with cancer and I\u2019m coming to you. I\u2019m coming to Unite for HER. What would you tell me about how you might be able to help me, what I\u2019m going to experience if I work with your non-profit or benefit from your services?"},{"author":"Weldon: ","text":"Yeah. So I would welcome you into our community first, and just applaud you for making that step, right? To make the step, to reach out and get your resources, sometimes as women, we feel like we\u2019ve got to do it all, right, and that we can handle it and we can stay strong. Then we just sort of talk through where they are with our wellness-program management team. They\u2019re extraordinary, our registered dieticians. Then we meet them there and say, \u201cOkay, this is how we can help you with these side effects and symptoms. By the way, you\u2019re not going to have any financial burden. We\u2019re going to offer you a wellness program with a passport.\u201d We call it a wellness passport of two thousand dollars\u2019 worth of treatments. Those two thousand dollars\u2019 worth of treatments, you get to choose, right? You get to choose how it\u2019s going to work for you. Some women may have sleep deprivation or depression and they might approach it differently. But the outcome may be the same, right? Some may dive into nutrition. Our cooking classes alone, our registered dietician team, they\u2019re so dynamic and just so fun. To have a cooking class where you\u2019re with these women and you\u2019re taking your mind off of it, but you\u2019re learning whole-food nutrition and learning how this food is going to help with the metallic taste in your mouth or digestion, it just allows you to take control. That\u2019s where we let them know that we\u2019re going to, one step at a time, give you a little bit of that control and confidence back, and we\u2019re with them for life."},{"author":"Hall","text":": What do you say to skeptics? People who say, what does acupuncture do? What do these things do? Really, they need chemotherapy. They need medical treatments. Does this really make a difference?"},{"author":"Weldon","text":": Yeah. So let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re correct in this. We are not an either or. We are in addition to. Yes, you\u2019re getting your chemotherapy. You\u2019re getting your medical treatments. You\u2019re getting your surgery. We are not preaching anything different than that. We are saying, in addition to that, we\u2019re going to help you with your side effects and symptoms. When you have chemotherapy, you have stomach issues, you have bone pain, you have headaches, you have depression, you have neuropathy, you have hot flashes, this is all science and research based. This is in the journals, right, of the medical journals that talk about acupuncture helping with cancer patients. Massage helping to alleviate stress. Whole-food nutrition, I mean, there\u2019s so much science and data. Everything we do is backed by science and data. But rest assured, this is not an either or. This is in compliment with the standard of care. So we do it in line with your medical team. We are talking with them. We are connecting the different physicians together so that way we have this whole-patient care."},{"author":"Hall: ","text":"Sounds like you\u2019re just doing what the doctors don\u2019t have time to do or the training to do."},{"author":"Weldon: ","text":"Yeah. Both. I mean, they have such a big job to do and I am so in awe of our medical community and the strides that they have made. So much has changed since I was diagnosed. But what we talk about is that they treat the cancer, we treat the woman. We treat the physical, emotional part of that healing process, which actually makes them do better on treatment."},{"author":"Hall: ","text":"So let\u2019s move on and talk about the award that you received. So what did it mean to you to be nominated and then eventually win this Catalyst for Care Award?"},{"author":"Weldon: ","text":"We were just so honored. I always put the we in there because Unite for HER just was able to now finally be looked at on the national stage. This award helped us with that, right? To be recognized for the work that we did. We were in the Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware area. When COVID hit, we expanded because we did our programming differently. We did a virtual. That means we could go anywhere. We mailed it right to their home. The award just came at that perfect time where people were recognizing the work that we did. There\u2019s not many people doing integrative care and meeting them at their home, or right in their home community in such an impactful way. So for us to be able to get that message out, and what an incredible team to work with, both Scientific American and AstraZeneca put us on this platform that allowed our story to be heard, came in and interviewed us and had this staff there and shared and interviewed our patients to tell this beautiful story. That\u2019s powerful. That exposure is one area, but then the beautiful grant, such a generous grant on top of that that served another 100 women. That\u2019s just extraordinary."},{"author":"Hall","text":": I understand that you\u2019re a judge this year. Can you give me a sense of what the nominees were like and what that experience was like?"},{"author":"Weldon: ","text":"Oh my gosh. Wow. Extraordinary. To be on the other side of it and to be able to look at all those different non-profits or movers and shakers in the cancer community that really are all about whole-patient care. They\u2019re all doing it in different ways. But together, we have this collaborative approach, right? So yeah, it gave me a whole new respect on the whole judging process and what it took for us to be there. I can\u2019t wait to see this next person come up and feel all the goodness that we did."},{"author":"Hall: ","text":"What are you looking forward to in the next year? What gives you hope? How are you growing and changing?"},{"author":"Weldon: ","text":"We\u2019re serving a lot of women now. So for us, it\u2019s making sure our infrastructure\u2019s strong so we can maintain it. We want to maintain our hands-on, engaged approach. We never want to lose that. That\u2019s what made us who we are. So for us, we want to focus on making sure that all those services that we\u2019re putting out there, that they get used, that they\u2019re understood, that the education is put in front of them. How do we do that in a way that transcends across the nation like it did locally? We don\u2019t want to lose that high-touch feel that Unite for HER was known for. We don\u2019t want that to change, right? Even though we\u2019re growing very quickly, our roots, we\u2019re a hands-on experience. We have to work on that and continue to serve. Our biggest priority is to make sure that we get to the ones that needs the most and prioritize a lot of those underserved communities. We developed a Spanish-speaking-only wellness program because we wanted to make sure we were embedded in the culture. We\u2019re leaning into making sure our women of color, our Black and brown women don\u2019t have this health-equity gap that is just so devastating. What can we do to do our part? So for us, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re getting into those communities and understanding and recruiting in a way that is so impactful."},{"author":"Hall","text":": Well, Sue Weldon, it was such a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much for taking the time."},{"author":"Weldon","text":": Yeah. Well, thank you. It was great.
