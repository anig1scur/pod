We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research and help you understand what it really means."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And we\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors. Today\u00a0we\u2019ll explain why the CDC now wants vaccinated people to wear masks indoors again."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And we\u2019ll discuss one big reason why some people still refuse to get vaccinated. Just a few months ago, the CDC said vaccinated people didn\u2019t have to wear masks in most settings. But this week the agency reversed course, saying vaccinated people should wear masks at times. What do the recommendations say? And why the sudden shift in position?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"In its latest guidance, the CDC says that vaccinated people should once again wear masks in public indoor settings under certain circumstances\u2014for example, if you live in an area with high levels of COVID transmission. (This includes people who live in places with more than 50 cases per 100,000 people in the last week.) The agency also recommended universal masking in all K\u201312 schools, including all students, teachers\u00a0and staff. The CDC says the reason for the shift is new data about the Delta variant and breakthrough infections."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Delta is known to be much more transmissible than previous strains\u00a0and appears to produce about 1,000 times as much virus in the body as the original strain. There have been reports of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people, and in rare cases, they may be able to transmit it to others. So the reason behind vaccinated people wearing masks is to prevent them from transmitting the virus to people who cannot get vaccinated, such as children under 12\u00a0or those who are immunocompromised. Breakthrough infections are expected, as no vaccine is 100 percent effective."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And they may be more common than we thought with the Delta variant, according to data from the U.K. and Israel. Still, the vaccines are extremely good at preventing severe disease and death\u2014the vast majority of those hospitalized with COVID right now are unvaccinated. If you\u2019re vaccinated, and you get COVID, it doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine didn\u2019t work. As former surgeon general Jerome Adams put it in a tweet, \u201cThink of the virus like the ocean, the vaccine like a life vest...."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"You may still get wet..., but your life vest ([the] vaccine) significantly lessens the chance you\u2019ll drown.\u00a0 And getting wet doesn\u2019t mean the life vest didn\u2019t work.\u201d Over the past several weeks cases, deaths and hospitalizations have all been rising in the US. We have defenses against the disease, but some people won\u2019t use them. Vaccinations have stalled, and some unvaccinated people still refuse to wear masks. Most of us are baffled by all this. Why are people so resistant?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I think there are lots of reasons, but there is one big one: many people still do not think COVID is a serious and deadly disease. There are two factors that contribute to this. One has to do with numbers. The other has to do with who we listen to. Let\u2019s look at numbers first. We have 330 million people in this country. CDC data shows that during the 18 months of the pandemic, 2.3 million have been admitted to the hospital, an indication of serious illness."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Imagine a big bowl of 300 million marbles\u00a0and then drop in two million more. They\u2019d be hard to spot. So there\u2019s a good chance that, out of hundreds of millions of Americans, somebody might not know another person who\u2019s had a severe COVID bout. It\u2019s easier to dismiss it as a mild illness if severe disease is not part of your personal experience. That appears to be what unvaccinated people believe. In June the Kaiser Family Foundation polled people about getting the vaccine. Fifty-seven percent of unvaccinated adults said what\u2019s in the news about COVID is generally exaggerated."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Only 22 percent of vaccinated adults say this. And 71 percent of unvaccinated adults say they are not at all worried, or not too worried, about getting sick from the virus."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s pretty mind-boggling. Who are they taking their cues from?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That belief has been reinforced by a lot of people, over the past year and a half, who have said that COVID isn\u2019t serious. Psychologist Robert Cialdini of Arizona State University studies how people form beliefs\u00a0and what influences them, so he and I talked about this. People pay a lot of attention to what others around them\u2014friends, family, neighbors, political leaders\u2014say or do, Cialdini says. If others who share your values have a particular attitude, that makes it more legit."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"The local patterns of low vaccine rates\u2014certain counties in Alabama or Missouri, for instance\u2014are examples of neighbors influencing neighbors this way. Then there are national influencers. We all heard Donald Trump say that COVID is not a big deal, no worse than the flu. A lot of Republican congresspeople and governors railed against mask wearing and refused to wear masks themselves. Cialdini points out these leaders were sowing uncertainty, and uncertainty about what to do amplified their social influence. Now we\u2019re seeing the results, as deaths and hospitalizations race higher and higher among unvaccinated people."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But attitudes can change, Cialdini says. Social disapproval changes them\u2014not yelling or finger-pointing. But if local leaders say that shunning vaccines hurts the community, and hurts people themselves, that can be surprisingly effective. Those notions ripple around neighborhoods. The vaccines, he hopes, will follow those ripples."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Now you\u2019re up to speed. Thanks for joining us. It\u2019s summer, and we\u2019re about to leave on a short break."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"We\u2019ll be back at the end of August. So come back then for more COVID, Quickly!
