      "text": "The night of May 23, 2022, was an exciting one for me. I was at my house in northern Colorado, winding down for the day. My phone buzzed. I pulled up the alert. It showed that a large movement of migratory birds was coming my way, and they might just fly right over my house. I stepped outside on that cool, calm, and cloudy night and turned my ears to the sky. I could already hear them flying overhead: dozens of Swainson\u2019s Thrushes. I rushed inside and turned on my audio recorder. Before the sun came up the following morning, my microphone captured nearly 1,200 nocturnal flight calls, nearly twice as many as I counted any other night that spring. And I was ready for it."

Migratory birds are in peril. For many, that peril comes from one very dangerous, if not so obvious, pollutant: artificial light at night. This light disorients migratory birds, pulling them off course and putting them in harm\u2019s way. It is thought that artificial light contributes to the deaths of millions of birds each year. In this episode, we shed some light on how scientists are working to help darken the skies overhead so migratory birds can find safe passage in the night."

      "text": "When that massive movement of migratory Swainson\u2019s Thrushes flew over my house, I was prepared to record it because I had some advanced warning. As science has pulled back the curtain on the magnitude of night migration, its vastness has necessitated the development of technology to detect all of these birds in the night sky. Using technology to predict the movement of birds across the continent is not that different from predicting the movement of weather systems. We can do this because of radar."

WSR-88 is when they [were] reengineered in 1988, and the D [is] telling us that these radars have Doppler capacity."

      "text": ": I use, primarily use weather surveillance radars to monitor the passage of nocturnally migrating birds. So when I was a graduate student, I started with three sites, and that was a big deal. We went up to six sites. By the end of my Ph.D., we were working on a study with 20 sites, and at that point, that was the largest study of using radar data in the U.S. for migratory birds, and it seemed like a massive achievement at that point. I would say within a year from us starting that study, we had ramped up to a study using all of the radars, all 143."

That signal returning can tell us something about the intensity of that signal. Is it big or small? Is it a small rain droplet or a big rain droplet? That signal that returns can tell us which direction things are moving: north, south, east or west. It can tell us how fast things are moving as well. So again, those tools, those measurements are set up for meteorologists to quantify the movement of a thunderstorm or a tornado or a hurricane coming through the Gulf of Mexico region."

It\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re detecting tens of birds or hundreds of birds, but we\u2019re talking about hundreds of thousands of birds to millions of birds on a given night. And I think those numbers are just\u2014they\u2019re eye-popping in a way. They\u2019re hard to comprehend. I sometimes have to give myself a sanity check, too, of \u201cIs it really possible we\u2019re detecting 500 million birds flying across the U.S.?\u201d And you do the numbers, you crunch them.... Okay, yep, that makes sense."

The temperature is X, Y or Z. Cloud cover is at this level. And we see this amount of migration.\u201d"

They pulled nearly 25 years of past radar data to look at the relationship between birds and weather. With a lot of help from machine learning, the relationship was stunningly clear and highly predictable. This is mostly how I knew that May 23, 2022, had the potential to be a big night for night calls over my house."

It\u2019s not the tower that they\u2019re colliding with, it\u2019s usually the guy wires. But why are they circling around a communication tower? And usually the light on the communication tower, they are entrained into that light. They circle around it. They\u2019re calling, giving these flight calls, and then they collide with something that they ultimately didn\u2019t see, the guy wires supporting the communication tower."

When we go there on September 11, when the towers of light are set up to remember the lives lost during the terrorist attacks, there's no missing them. They cast miles up into the airspace; you can see them from upwards of 60 miles away on the horizon. Birds flock to those lights en masse. We see thousands of birds, warblers, circling the towers of light. In that case, there\u2019s not ultimately a structure associated with those lights, but the birds are very clearly attracted to those lights. The lights go on; the birds show up. The lights go off; the birds dissipate."

Scientists aren\u2019t entirely positive why birds produce night flight calls, but when they make these calls reveals some clues. Birds emit night flight calls more frequently during poor weather conditions, such as fog and rain. They also call more when disturbed or flying in particularly dense flocks\u2014and, it turns out, when they encounter light pollution. This suggests that the night calls might play a role in birds\u2019 flocking dynamics\u2014sort of an attempt to keep one another safe. As birds call out when they\u2019re disoriented in light pollution, however, it attracts even more birds into the light, putting more individuals in danger of running into objects and killing them. To combat this problem, BirdCast is working to get anti-light-pollution-proactive."

They\u2019re not the same 10 nights every year, but it\u2019s about 10 nights when you\u2019re gonna see the vast majority of migrants pass through any given region. [CLIP: Serious music]"
