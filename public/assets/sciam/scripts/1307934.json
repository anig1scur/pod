These two NASA astronauts set out to spend just over a week in space in June, but now they won\u2019t actually be home until around February. Earlier this month\u2014not long after the ill-fated Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without them onboard\u2014the pair conducted a press release from the International Space Station. Suni said they\u2019re making the most of their extra time in space by being the best crewmates they can be, and both noted that they\u2019re looking forward to voting in the 2024 presidential election from space. They\u2019ve sent in their requests for absentee ballots, which will be encrypted and downlinked to their local county clerks\u2019 offices. Both will have to list their current address as \u201clow-Earth orbit,\u201d which is kind of adorable. So if voting on November 5 means standing in a long line or dealing with other inconvenient logistics, just take a second to look up into the sky and be grateful that you\u2019re not stuck in space for, like, eight months longer than intended.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"","text":"Here\u2019s a bit more space news. A study published last Monday suggests that Earth might have once had a cool cosmic fashion accessory: a giant ring like the one surrounding Saturn. The study authors hypothesize that the ring of space rocks might have formed about 466 million years ago when a big ol\u2019 asteroid got too close and succumbed to our planet\u2019s tidal forces. Once it broke apart to form a ring system, it could have blocked enough sunlight to cool the planet\u2014and sent loads of meteorites down to collide with the surface. In fact, the scientists formed this hypothesis to try to explain a period of frequent meteorite strikes some 485 million to 443 million years ago. They\u2019ll need more evidence to solidify their findings, but in the meantime I think it\u2019s pretty cool to imagine our planet with a big, rocky Hula-Hoop.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"And speaking of our Pale Blue Dot, a study published last Friday reminds us of just how complex it is. Researchers found that iron stuck to dust carried on the wind from the Sahara all the way to the Atlantic Ocean plays a crucial role in supporting marine life. Not all forms of iron in the environment are \u201cbioreactive,\u201d or accessible to living things. Researchers say that the iron that travels in Saharan dust actually becomes more bioreactive as it blows through the atmosphere, thanks to chemical reactions that take place there, that means that this long-distance delivery is potentially crucial for supporting life in locations like the Amazonian basin and the Bahamas.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"","text":"In less thrilling environmental news, last Monday scientists published a report about microplastics found in the human brain. The researchers examined tissue from cadavers, looking specifically at their olfactory bulbs\u2014those are the parts of the brain that begin to process smells, and two of them sit above the nasal cavity. Samples from eight of the 15 cadavers contained bits of plastic ranging in size from 5.5 to 26.4 micrometers. It seems likely that we inhale these microplastics, and some worry this means they could make their way into to the rest of the brain. We do know that some microbes can make that jump. Microplastics have been linked to inflammatory reactions and could potentially be tied to all sorts of health problems. Last Thursday, an international group of experts in marine biology, sustainability, environmental psychology, global plastics policy and risk assessment published an article in the journal Science calling for international action to combat the plastic and microplastic problem. They warned of the risk of \u201cirreversible environmental damage\u201d if we don\u2019t take pains to drastically lower our plastic production, as well as find ways to lower emissions of and environmental pollution from the plastics we continue to use and discard. Their call to action actually coincides with the 20th anniversary of the first-ever study to use the term \u201cmicroplastics,\u201d which was also published in Science. For more on microplastics check out our June 24 episode.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s not the only alarm bell in health news from last week. Last Monday a study published in the Lancet analyzed the rising trend in antimicrobial resistance, or AMR. The study predicts that antimicrobial-resistant infections will kill more than 39 million people over the course of the next 25 years. Previous research has suggested that AMR could potentially become the world\u2019s leading cause of death by 2050. While pathogens naturally evolve over time to become resistant to treatments like antibiotics and antivirals, this process is happening much faster because of our overuse of antimicrobials for treating humans, plants and animals. Leaders at this week\u2019s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly are expected to sign off on global commitments to fight AMR.\u00a0\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"Another health study out last week in Nature Neuroscience aims to unlock the secrets of an infamous phenomenon: pregnancy brain\u2014or, more accurately, all the changes in the brain that come along with gestation. For the first time, researchers followed an individual through their first pregnancy to map changes in their brain\u2014starting before conception and ending two years postpartum. The research team says the most pronounced changes occurred in the cortical gray matter, a.k.a. the wrinkly outer section of the brain. As the body made more pregnancy hormones, gray matter volume decreased\u2014a change that persisted for the length of the study. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; the researchers compared it to changes we see as brains transition through puberty and into adulthood. They also saw an increase in white matter, which facilitates communication between different parts of the brain, which peaked during the second trimester and returned to baseline around the time the person gave birth. While we can\u2019t be sure how one person\u2019s experience during pregnancy might compare to the typical neurological changes a pregnant person might go through, the researchers have made their dataset freely available online to encourage further research on the subject.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"","text":"Now, you all know I like to end on a fun one when I can, and what\u2019s more fun than an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny scuba-diving lizard? I don\u2019t know what, but if you do, email it to me, I want to see it."},{"author":"","text":"Researchers who study semiaquatic lizards called water anoles had previously noted that the animals form funny little bubbles on top of their nostrils when they dive to avoid predators. Now scientists have confirmed that those bubbles are more than just an adorable side effect of taking a quick dip: the lizards are actually using the air pockets to breathe. By treating some lizards with topicals that kept air from sticking to the skin\u2014thus preventing bubble formation\u2014a new study showed that these little diving helmets allow the reptiles to stay underwater for 32 percent longer than they could otherwise. In a press release, study author Lindsey Swierk described anoles as the \u201cchicken nuggets of the forest,\u201d with loads of potential predators. So it\u2019s not surprising that the little guys have evolved a trick that helps them stay underwater for at least 20 minutes to evade animals trying to make a drive-through run.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup.

These two NASA astronauts set out to spend just over a week in space in June, but now they won\u2019t actually be home until around February. Earlier this month\u2014not long after the ill-fated Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without them onboard\u2014the pair conducted a press release from the International Space Station. Suni said they\u2019re making the most of their extra time in space by being the best crewmates they can be, and both noted that they\u2019re looking forward to voting in the 2024 presidential election from space. They\u2019ve sent in their requests for absentee ballots, which will be encrypted and downlinked to their local county clerks\u2019 offices. Both will have to list their current address as \u201clow-Earth orbit,\u201d which is kind of adorable. So if voting on November 5 means standing in a long line or dealing with other inconvenient logistics, just take a second to look up into the sky and be grateful that you\u2019re not stuck in space for, like, eight months longer than intended."]},{"begin":"106.000","end":"109.800","lines":["[CLIP: Music]"]},{"begin":"109.800","end":"157.680","lines":["Here\u2019s a bit more space news. A study published last Monday suggests that Earth might have once had a cool cosmic fashion accessory: a giant ring like the one surrounding Saturn. The study authors hypothesize that the ring of space rocks might have formed about 466 million years ago when a big ol\u2019 asteroid got too close and succumbed to our planet\u2019s tidal forces. Once it broke apart to form a ring system, it could have blocked enough sunlight to cool the planet\u2014and sent loads of meteorites down to collide with the surface. In fact, the scientists formed this hypothesis to try to explain a period of frequent meteorite strikes some 485 million to 443 million years ago. They\u2019ll need more evidence to solidify their findings, but in the meantime I think it\u2019s pretty cool to imagine our planet with a big, rocky Hula-Hoop."]},{"begin":"157.680","end":"196.520","lines":["And speaking of our Pale Blue Dot, a study published last Friday reminds us of just how complex it is. Researchers found that iron stuck to dust carried on the wind from the Sahara all the way to the Atlantic Ocean plays a crucial role in supporting marine life. Not all forms of iron in the environment are \u201cbioreactive,\u201d or accessible to living things. Researchers say that the iron that travels in Saharan dust actually becomes more bioreactive as it blows through the atmosphere, thanks to chemical reactions that take place there, that means that this long-distance delivery is potentially crucial for supporting life in locations like the Amazonian basin and the Bahamas."]},{"begin":"196.520","end":"198.160","lines":["[CLIP: Music]"]},{"begin":"198.160","end":"282.920","lines":["In less thrilling environmental news, last Monday scientists published a report about microplastics found in the human brain. The researchers examined tissue from cadavers, looking specifically at their olfactory bulbs\u2014those are the parts of the brain that begin to process smells, and two of them sit above the nasal cavity. Samples from eight of the 15 cadavers contained bits of plastic ranging in size from 5.5 to 26.4 micrometers. It seems likely that we inhale these microplastics, and some worry this means they could make their way into to the rest of the brain. We do know that some microbes can make that jump. Microplastics have been linked to inflammatory reactions and could potentially be tied to all sorts of health problems. Last Thursday, an international group of experts in marine biology, sustainability, environmental psychology, global plastics policy and risk assessment published an article in the journal Science calling for international action to combat the plastic and microplastic problem. They warned of the risk of \u201cirreversible environmental damage\u201d if we don\u2019t take pains to drastically lower our plastic production, as well as find ways to lower emissions of and environmental pollution from the plastics we continue to use and discard. Their call to action actually coincides with the 20th anniversary of the first-ever study to use the term \u201cmicroplastics,\u201d which was also published in Science. For more on microplastics check out our June 24 episode."]},{"begin":"282.920","end":"327.160","lines":["That\u2019s not the only alarm bell in health news from last week. Last Monday a study published in the Lancet analyzed the rising trend in antimicrobial resistance, or AMR. The study predicts that antimicrobial-resistant infections will kill more than 39 million people over the course of the next 25 years. Previous research has suggested that AMR could potentially become the world\u2019s leading cause of death by 2050. While pathogens naturally evolve over time to become resistant to treatments like antibiotics and antivirals, this process is happening much faster because of our overuse of antimicrobials for treating humans, plants and animals. Leaders at this week\u2019s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly are expected to sign off on global commitments to fight AMR."]},{"begin":"327.160","end":"393.440","lines":["Another health study out last week in Nature Neuroscience aims to unlock the secrets of an infamous phenomenon: pregnancy brain\u2014or, more accurately, all the changes in the brain that come along with gestation. For the first time, researchers followed an individual through their first pregnancy to map changes in their brain\u2014starting before conception and ending two years postpartum. The research team says the most pronounced changes occurred in the cortical gray matter, a.k.a. the wrinkly outer section of the brain. As the body made more pregnancy hormones, gray matter volume decreased\u2014a change that persisted for the length of the study. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; the researchers compared it to changes we see as brains transition through puberty and into adulthood. They also saw an increase in white matter, which facilitates communication between different parts of the brain, which peaked during the second trimester and returned to baseline around the time the person gave birth. While we can\u2019t be sure how one person\u2019s experience during pregnancy might compare to the typical neurological changes a pregnant person might go through, the researchers have made their dataset freely available online to encourage further research on the subject."]},{"begin":"393.440","end":"394.480","lines":["[CLIP: Music]"]},{"begin":"394.480","end":"406.360","lines":["Now, you all know I like to end on a fun one when I can, and what\u2019s more fun than an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny scuba-diving lizard?

By treating some lizards with topicals that kept air from sticking to the skin\u2014thus preventing bubble formation\u2014a new study showed that these little diving helmets allow the reptiles to stay underwater for 32 percent longer than they could otherwise. In a press release, study author Lindsey Swierk described anoles as the \u201cchicken nuggets of the forest,\u201d with loads of potential predators.
