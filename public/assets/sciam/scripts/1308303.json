Are they getting enough sleep? If not, you might assume they\u2019re just falling prey to late nights on social media and school-related stress. But research suggests that for a huge percentage of kids and young adults, low iron levels may be to blame for their fatigue. It turns out that menstruation poses a bigger risk to iron levels than many doctors realize."},{"author":"","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. My guest today is Angela Weyand, a pediatric hematologist and clinical associate professor at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. She\u2019s here to explain how iron deficiency can affect everything from energy levels to mental health\u2014regardless of whether it leads to full-blown anemia\u2014and why doctors so often miss it, especially in adolescents."},{"author":"","text":"Thanks so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Angela Weyand","text":"Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So let\u2019s start with a pretty basic question: What is anemia, and why is it important that it\u2019s properly diagnosed?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Sure, so anemia is when your hemoglobin is low or kind of\u2014we think about that as, like, the number of red blood cells, which are important cells that carry oxygen to all of your tissues. It\u2019s incredibly prevalent and can cause a lot of problems; as you can imagine, it\u2019s important that we get adequate oxygen to all of our tissues, and so when we\u2019re anemic and it impairs our ability to do that, we can have a lot of different symptoms. Probably the most common that people think of is fatigue."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So, when did you start to suspect that some cases of anemia were flying under the radar?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Yeah, so I mentioned I\u2019m a pediatric hematologist, and I see a lot of adolescents and young women who have heavy menstrual bleeding, and that is one way that you can become quite anemic. So I see at\u2014I work at a large academic medical center, so I see pretty severe cases but was thinking that if I\u2019m seeing as many patients as I\u2019m seeing with pretty severe anemia that there\u2019s probably a lot of people out there that have less severe anemia that aren\u2019t necessarily being identified."},{"author":"","text":"Most of that is iron-deficiency anemia, which I think is a whole \u2019nother issue that is very undiagnosed and often dismissed. And iron deficiency\u2014actually, a lot of people conflate iron deficiency with anemia, but they\u2019re actually two different things. And iron deficiency, even when you\u2019re not anemic, also matters and can cause a lot of symptoms and problems."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so how did you go about investigating that?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Yeah, so we did a big study that [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has, kind of national study that they do called NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey], where they collect data on kind of the general population and they get a lot of demographic data, medical history data; they get labs from them; and then it\u2019s available to researchers to use for free."},{"author":"","text":"And so we just took that database and looked at adolescents between 12 and 21 years of age that were female because a big risk factor for iron deficiency and anemia is menstruation \u2019cause that\u2019s how you lose iron. And so we looked at that and kind of tried to weed out a number of patients who had other diseases or kind of other co-morbidities that would affect our prevalence to try to really get at what we would consider a healthy population to determine the rate of both iron deficiency and then also iron-deficiency anemia."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. Well, what exactly has your research found?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Yeah, so overall we found that about\u2014it was 38.6 percent, so almost 40 percent of those 12- to 21-year-old females who were kind of otherwise healthy were iron-deficient ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah."},{"author":"Weyand","text":"And a smaller proportion, around 6 percent, were iron-deficient and anemic, because iron deficiency is kind of a spectrum, where you can be iron-deficient for quite some time and then kind of the severe end of iron deficiency, you become anemic."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So how is it that doctors are, you know, so routinely missing these signs of iron deficiency and anemia in patients?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"I think it\u2019s just really tough because the symptoms are so nonspecific, right? So if you think about other medical conditions: people talk about if you have chest pain, like, you\u2019re having a heart attack, right? But a lot of the symptoms of iron deficiency and anemia are things like trouble sleeping\u2014okay, well, there\u2019s lots of causes for not sleeping well. Fatigue\u2014there\u2019s lots of reasons for people to be fatigued, especially in today\u2019s day and age, where people are so busy and not necessarily getting adequate sleep or have time to exercise or eat healthy. So fatigue is\u2014you know, can be caused by lots of things, and I think most of the people I see, even though I\u2019m seeing adolescents, they\u2019re all tired, right, so ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Weyand","text":"That doesn\u2019t necessarily point you in a specific direction. Other things that it\u2019s associated with, like depression and anxiety, are also really common and can be associated,or due to other things outside of iron deficiency."},{"author":"","text":"It can also cause things like hair loss, which also, you know, people don\u2019t necessarily have a good sense of, like, how much hair you should be losing. Or even, like, fatigue\u2014like, how do we rate fatigue? Like, if you talk to a lot of people, they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m tired,\u201d but when is it actually a problem versus just, \u201cOkay, maybe you need to, like, sleep a little later on the weekend\u201d?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. I understand that anemia or iron deficiency were more prevalent in certain groups; is that correct?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Yes, that\u2019s correct. So the most affected kind of worldwide are women of reproductive age, or, you know, people who menstruate or can get pregnant, as well as kind of toddlers is another kind of age group where it can be more prevalent as well."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And what are sort of the, the main takeaways for both doctors and patients from what you found?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"So I think for a doctor specifically, you know, in medical school, we\u2019re really taught iron deficiency is important because it causes anemia, right? And anemia, as I mentioned, is, like, the latest stage of iron deficiency, so you have to be very iron-deficient before your body stops making enough red blood cells. But we know that iron is actually involved in all of these different other areas, right, that cause the other symptoms, like poor sleep and anxiety and depression and fatigue. And so I think it\u2019s really important for doctors to remember from way back in med school that actually there\u2019s a lot of different other processes in the body that matter, and so even if your patient isn\u2019t anemic, if they\u2019re iron-deficient, they may feel much better if they can get that corrected."},{"author":"","text":"And I think for patients, it\u2019s really hard because I think, especially the population that\u2019s affected by this, when you think about reproductive-age people who menstruate, they may not recognize their symptoms as something that should prompt them to go to the doctor or that\u2019s fixable. And then oftentimes when they do go to their health care provider, they may have been dismissed previously as like, \u201cOkay, well, eat better or sleep more, exercise more.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so I think just having this knowledge of this is very prevalent in people who menstruate and can cause all of these kind of wide-ranging symptoms that\u2014I don\u2019t ever think it\u2019s bad to go to your doctor and say, \u201cHey, you know, I read this article that said 40 percent of people,\u201d you know\u2014and we looked at a young age, right, so you can imagine that if these patients aren\u2019t identified, it\u2019s not like this problem is gonna get better on its own. And so it\u2019s probably even higher in older ages."},{"author":"","text":"So I think just being aware that this is a problem and it is a very correctable problem; it's not something, like, that we say, \u201cOh, well, now we know why you\u2019re tired, but sorry, nothing to do about it.\u201d There\u2019s very effective treatments that are widely available and inexpensive and oftentimes make people feel much, much better."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What else do you think it's important for people to know about iron deficiency and anemia?"},{"author":"Weyand","text":"I would say, as someone who sees a lot of adolescents, they come in\u2014and as I said, I see, like, the most severe cases, where they\u2019re very anemic and, like, sometimes require blood transfusions and being hospitalized, which is a big deal. But I think so often the root cause is their periods, and I think that\u2019s something we don\u2019t talk about enough: that\u2014like, what a normal period is. So I\u2019ll have people tell me, like, \u201cMy periods are normal,\u201d but they bleed for three weeks out of the month, \u2019cause I don\u2019t think that we, as a society, do a great job of talking about that; it\u2019s so stigmatized."},{"author":"","text":"So I would just say kind of being aware of what a normal period is can be so helpful for patients, I think. And it really shouldn\u2019t be bleeding more than seven days a month. It really should be: you should go multiple hours without having to change a product. And you shouldn\u2019t be having accidents at school or at work because you can\u2019t get up to change or having to wake up overnight to change things."},{"author":"","text":"Those would all be signs that you\u2019re bleeding too much. And that\u2019s another area of medicine where we have a lot of options that can help people, but it\u2019s important to identify that it\u2019s abnormal so that you can avoid things like severe iron-deficiency anemia."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for coming on. This has been really informative."},{"author":"Weyand","text":"Thank you so much for having me.

I understand that anemia or iron deficiency were more prevalent in certain groups; is that correct?"]},{"begin":"335.640","end":"349.320","lines":["Yes, that\u2019s correct. So the most affected kind of worldwide are women of reproductive age, or, you know, people who menstruate or can get pregnant, as well as kind of toddlers is another kind of age group where it can be more prevalent as well."]},{"begin":"349.320","end":"355.080","lines":["And what are sort of the, the main takeaways for both doctors and patients from what you found?"]},{"begin":"355.080","end":"395.240","lines":["So I think for a doctor specifically, you know, in medical school, we\u2019re really taught iron deficiency is important because it causes anemia, right? And anemia, as I mentioned, is, like, the latest stage of iron deficiency, so you have to be very iron-deficient before your body stops making enough red blood cells. But we know that iron is actually involved in all of these different other areas, right, that cause the other symptoms, like poor sleep and anxiety and depression and fatigue. And so I think it\u2019s really important for doctors to remember from way back in med school that actually there\u2019s a lot of different other processes in the body that matter, and so even if your patient isn\u2019t anemic, if they\u2019re iron-deficient, they may feel much better if they can get that corrected."]},{"begin":"395.240","end":"419.400","lines":["And I think for patients, it\u2019s really hard because I think, especially the population that\u2019s affected by this, when you think about reproductive-age people who menstruate, they may not recognize their symptoms as something that should prompt them to go to the doctor or that\u2019s fixable. And then oftentimes when they do go to their health care provider, they may have been dismissed previously as like, \u201cOkay, well, eat better or sleep more, exercise more.\u201d"]},{"begin":"419.400","end":"444.120","lines":["And so I think just having this knowledge of this is very prevalent in people who menstruate and can cause all of these kind of wide-ranging symptoms that\u2014I don\u2019t ever think it\u2019s bad to go to your doctor and say, \u201cHey, you know, I read this article that said 40 percent of people,\u201d you know\u2014and we looked at a young age, right, so you can imagine that if these patients aren\u2019t identified, it\u2019s not like this problem is gonna get better on its own. And so it\u2019s probably even higher in older ages."]},{"begin":"444.120","end":"459.920","lines":["So I think just being aware that this is a problem and it is a very correctable problem; it's not something, like, that we say, \u201cOh, well, now we know why you\u2019re tired, but sorry, nothing to do about it.\u201d There\u2019s very effective treatments that are widely available and inexpensive and oftentimes make people feel much, much better."]},{"begin":"459.920","end":"464.720","lines":["What else do you think it's important for people to know about iron deficiency and anemia?"]},{"begin":"464.720","end":"492.200","lines":["I would say, as someone who sees a lot of adolescents, they come in\u2014and as I said, I see, like, the most severe cases, where they\u2019re very anemic and, like, sometimes require blood transfusions and being hospitalized, which is a big deal. But I think so often the root cause is their periods, and I think that\u2019s something we don\u2019t talk about enough: that\u2014like, what a normal period is. So I\u2019ll have people tell me, like, \u201cMy periods are normal,\u201d but they bleed for three weeks out of the month, \u2019cause I don\u2019t think that we, as a society, do a great job of talking about that; it\u2019s so stigmatized."]},{"begin":"492.200","end":"510.960","lines":["So I would just say kind of being aware of what a normal period is can be so helpful for patients, I think. And it really shouldn\u2019t be bleeding more than seven days a month. It really should be: you should go multiple hours without having to change a product. And you shouldn\u2019t be having accidents at school or at work because you can\u2019t get up to change or having to wake up overnight to change things."]},{"begin":"510.960","end":"526.200","lines":["Those would all be signs that you\u2019re bleeding too much. And that\u2019s another area of medicine where we have a lot of options that can help people, but it\u2019s important to identify that it\u2019s abnormal so that you can avoid things like severe iron-deficiency anemia."]},{"begin":"526.200","end":"532.280","lines":["Well, thank you so much for coming on.
