It\u2019s a microscopic worm called a rotifer that was brought back to life after spending about 25,000 years locked in the arctic permafrost. Its tale is told in the journal Current Biology. [Shmakova et al., A living bdelloid rotifer from 24,000-year-old Arctic permafrost.]"

And considering they\u2019re more or less teeny tiny worms, they\u2019re actually cute little guys."

Because those organisms are attached to particles, they are contorted, folded up, and we cannot see them even with microscope. So we need to wait until they reactivate from this cryptobiosis, come out from this permafrost piece, start moving, multiplying, and so on."

It\u2019s relatively rare event when something alive is isolated from this cores\u2014which is also considered an indirect proof that it\u2019s not a contamination. Because, you know, if it was like every sample, or maybe each second sample, will yield some live organism. Here it\u2019s about one out of 20 or even more rare."

      "text": ": So, the previous record for frozen rotifers was a decade or so. And this guy\u2014I mean, gal\u2014was around when woolly mammoths walked the planet. Now, the fact that rotifers can spring to life after a thaw is not a total surprise. Entering a state of cryptobiosis allows even modern rotifers to survive seasonal changes in their local environment and more otherworldly assaults."
