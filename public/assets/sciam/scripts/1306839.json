But maybe it should have been because slime is incredibly cool stuff. This is Christopher Intagliata, and you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly. Today I\u2019m taking you on the first of a three-part journey into the deeply sticky\u2014and fascinating\u2014subject of slime. Mucus, it turns out, is nothing to sniff at. Wildly complex and just as versatile, this stuff is a true miracle."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"So grab a tissue and prepare to be surprised by the multitude of species\u2014including us\u2014who are not only alive but also thriving because of mucus. [CLIP: Opening music]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"My fascination with mucus recently took me to Orange, California, where biology professor Douglas Fudge of Chapman University keeps a tank full of hagfish. They're eel-shaped fish and prolific producers of slime."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Smells a little fishy in here."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"Doesn\u2019t normally smell this fishy."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"These fish are ancient. They have no jaws, and these ones have this pinkish-gray skin that hangs on them loosely, like the skin of a hairless cat. And slime is their superpower. Sharks will bite them\u2014and choke on gill-clogging slime. After a little fishing around in the tank ..."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"You\u2019ve probably figured out by now, hagfish are escape artists."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"We\u2019ve got a hagfish in a bucket, and Douglas gives me my cue\u2014to pretend I'm a shark, basically."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"Pretend like you're a predator who's trying to take a bite, but do it with your hand ..."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"It\u2019s not gonna bite me, right?"},{"author":"Fudge","text":"It will not bite you."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"I\u2019m still leery of sticking my hand in the bucket and pinching this thing, but I do\u2014gently\u2014and all of a sudden ..."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"And remember ..."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"Ahh!"},{"author":"Fudge","text":"You barely touched it, and it's ..."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"All right, my hand is covered in goo now."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"All right, I\u2019m gonna help you out."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"Whoa. Oh, my gosh, the whole bucket is, like ..."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"I get slimed\u2014with drippy, gooey, alien-caliber slime. But it's not quite like snot. Hagfish slime is a blend of mucus, seawater and silklike threads, which makes it behave in some really strange ways."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"As material scientists, even we struggle with how to define it. And that\u2019s, it\u2019s interesting because everyone is surprised by hagfish slime. And I\u2019ve thought a lot about that: Like, what is it that is so shocking about it? Like, what are the expectations that are being shattered when people see the properties of this stuff?"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"It looks just like water when it\u2019s in a beaker, but when Douglas pinches the surface, he can lift the whole thing out. It sticks together like a bag of water. It\u2019s just really, really weird."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"You know, there are no liquids that can do that."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"If you could turn this into a kids\u2019 toy, I think you might be a billionaire."},{"author":"Fudge","text":"Yeah, I think we might have to turn our attention to that."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Hagfish slime is incredibly unique in the animal kingdom, because it has those silklike threads. But regular old mucus is everywhere. And it\u2019s used for so many different things! Just ask the guy who curated what he calls one of the largest libraries of animal mucus on the planet."},{"author":"Antonio Cerullo: ","text":"So, hi, Chris. Welcome to the tour of our mucus library. So what we have here is a dedicated \u201380 degrees Celsius freezer for the storage and handling of animal mucus."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Antonio Cerullo is a slime scientist. He got his Ph.D. at the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he studied slime from all kinds of animals. And in this freezer, there are samples from more than 20 species, including Douglas\u2019s hagfish, plus 10 different types of salamanders, along with jellyfish, bullfrogs, cows, pigs, snails and lots more."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"So here we actually have a couple of exciting mucuses from oysters. So this is the expulsed mucus from Chaetopterus tube worms.... So here we actually have entire pieces of coral.... Embedded is the frozen mucus...."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The basic recipe for all this goo is proteins, sugars, salts and water."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"And these components come together and form a very large and very chaotic network of interactions to form this entire mucus gel."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That chaotic network of interactions makes mucus a sort of scientific enigma, even to this day. And in Antonio\u2019s view, the only way to truly understand it is to study as many kinds as possible\u2014hence the collection."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"Mucus is an entire universe, and there\u2019s so much to be learned about what it is, about how it works.... The wonder of it never stops.... As you keep looking, you keep finding new uses of mucus."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"If he sounds like a mucus evangelist, he is. He even practices what he preaches: he smears extracts from snail slime on his face."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"I think it has helped my skin glow and be a bit more radiant. I think it does hydrate me."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Lots of other people evidently do, too, because snail mucus is now a billion-dollar industry."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"In my personal experience, I prefer to use that at night because it tends to be a bit goopy."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"If you spend a little time talking to Antonio, you will soon realize that mucus is a universe\u2014and you'll be regaled with some truly incredible facts about animals deploying mucus in one way or another."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"One of the most interesting ones is the velvet worm, which is a creature that has propulsion jets on the side of its head to shoot out strands of slime to fight against predators or to capture prey. Oh, there is also the red triangle slug, which secretes an extremely strong mucus glue that [will cause] a frog chasing and trying to eat it [to actually] stick to a tree branch containing the mucus and be stuck there for days at a time. You have the parrotfish, [which] produces a mucus bubble to protect itself while it sleeps."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"The echidna, actually, it produces mucus bubbles from its nose to coat its nose ... to cool it down. You have the hippopotamus, [which] produces a mucus across its skin that keeps it hydrated when it leaves the water in the hot African heat and also contains UV protective pigments, which acts as a sunblock."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Mucus sunblock! How cool is that? If you're not experiencing mucus envy yet, maybe you should be? Even so, Antonio says he still gets side-eye when he mentions he has dedicated his scientific career to mucus."},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"Most people, when you mention mucus, you're met with disgust. But they\u2019re actually some of the most fascinating materials on Earth and some of the most important, so we hope that in our work, we can convince people that mucus is not gross but is rather beautiful and has such great importance out there in nature and is really just such an elegant material made of so many components that are all choreographed to have these very defined and dynamic roles."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"So you think it gets kind of a bad rap?"},{"author":"Cerullo","text":"Absolutely. Usually by the end of a discussion about mucus, my audience or my conversation partner really is convinced that mucus is amazing. [CLIP: End music]"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"In the next episode, we\u2019re gonna talk about the amazing things mucus does for us in our own body\u2014and some early medical experiments that, yes, involved drinking mucus milkshakes."},{"author":"Katharina Ribbeck: ","text":"What they found was one good vehicle for mucus delivery is milk or eggnog or liquids that are creamy.... And then the more undesirable aspects of mucus are disguised."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Hungry yet? Tune in next time.
