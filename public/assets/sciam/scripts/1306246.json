Well, it\u2019s the end of the year, and the whole team is taking a moment to look back at some of our favorite shows from 2023.\u00a0 My pick has all the elements of perfect podcast\u2013it\u2019s got monsters the size of small airplanes, a discovery hiding (for three decades) in plain site, and the words: \u201cpasserine peep show.\u201d\u00a0 It comes from host Flora Lichtman and it\u2019s also the start of an epic 4-part mini-series filled with creatures built like tanks and axe murderers.\u00a0 Basically a little thrill to add to your holiday chill.\u00a0 Enjoy, and see you next year! And happy holidays everybody.\u00a0 \u2014 This Episode originally aired on May 31, 2023. You can listen to the entire 4-part series on \u201cmonster birds\u201d here."

These winged whoppers are mysterious, and scientists are learning more about them every day. For the next four episodes of Science, Quickly, I\u2019m going to introduce you to them.

Some of those species would be far larger even than Pelagornis, and they die out in the same extinction event that kills off the nonavian dinosaurs, and that allows a new group to maybe explore the very large flying animal role. And pelagornithids are the first group that seizes that."

And I heard the same thing from many of the big bird researchers I talked to for this series\u2014that these giant birds trundled onto the scene in part because the mass extinction cleared the competition. And that didn\u2019t just mean dinosaurs; other reptiles and early birds went extinct, too. So the survivors had access to resources and ecosystems that weren\u2019t available before. I\u2019ve heard a lot about the mammalian radiation over the years\u2014that mammals had their heyday when dinos disappeared. But in a post-dinosaur world, birds also spread their wings and speciated."
