After all, research related to artificial intelligence showed up in not one but two Nobel Prize category awards this year. But while there are reasons to be excited about these technological advances, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned, too\u2014especially given the fact that while the proliferation of AI feels like it\u2019s going at breakneck speed, attempts to regulate the tech seem to be moving at a snail\u2019s pace. With policies now seriously overdue, the winner of the 2024 presidential election has the opportunity to have a huge impact on how artificial intelligence affects American life."},{"author":"","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Joining me today is Ben Guarino, an associate technology editor at Scientific American who has been keeping a close eye on the future of AI. He\u2019s here to tell us more about how Donald Trump and Kamala Harris differ in their stances on artificial intelligence\u2014and how their views could shape the world to come."},{"author":"","text":"Ben, thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Ben Guarino","text":"It\u2019s my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So as someone who\u2019s been following AI a lot for work, how has it changed as a political issue in recent years and even, perhaps, recent months?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, so that\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s really exploded as a mainstream political issue. So I went back to 1960, looking at presidential transcripts, after the Harris-Trump debate, and when Kamala Harris brought up AI, that was the first time any presidential candidate has mentioned AI in a mainstream political debate."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Kamala Harris speaks at September\u2019s presidential debate: \u201cUnder Donald Trump\u2019s presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military, basically sold us out, when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century, which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American-based technology so that we win the race on AI, on quantum computing.\u201d]"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"[Richard] Nixon and [John F.] Kennedy weren\u2019t debating this in 1960. But when Harris brought it up, you know, nobody really blinked; it was, like, a totally normal thing for her to mention. And I think that goes to show and illustrates that AI is part of our lives. With the debut of ChatGPT and these similar systems in 2022, it\u2019s really something that\u2019s touched on a lot of us, and I think this awareness of artificial intelligence comes with a pressure to regulate it. And we\u2019re aware of the powers that it has, and with that power comes calls for governance."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. Sort of a pulling-back-a-little-bit background question: Where are we at with AI right now? What is it doing that\u2019s interesting, exciting, perhaps terrifying, and what misconceptions exist about what it\u2019s capable of doing?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, so when we think of AI right now, I think what would be top of mind of most people is generative AI. So these are your ChatGPTs. These are your Google Geminis. These are predictive systems trained on huge amounts of data and then are creating something\u2014whether that\u2019s new text, whether that\u2019s video, whether that\u2019s audio."},{"author":"","text":"But AI is so much more than that. There are all of these systems that are designed to pull patterns and identify things out of data. So if we live in this universe of big data, which people, I\u2019m sure, have heard before, and they\u2019re going back 20 years, there was this idea that pure data was like crude oil: it needed to be refined. And now we have AI that\u2019s refining it, and we can transform data into usable things."},{"author":"","text":"So what\u2019s exciting, I think, with AI, and, you know, maybe people have experienced this the first time they\u2019ve used something like ChatGPT: you give it a prompt, and it comes out with this really\u2014at first glance, at least\u2014seemingly coherent text. And that\u2019s a really powerful feeling in a tool. And it\u2019s frictionless to use, so that, that\u2019s this term in technology where it\u2019s simple to use it; anybody with an Internet connection can go to OpenAI\u2019s website now, and it\u2019s being integrated in a lot of our software. So AI is in a lot of places, and that\u2019s why, I think, it\u2019s becoming this mainstream policy issue, is because you can\u2019t really turn on a phone or a computer and not touch on AI in, in some application."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, but I think a lot of the policy is still forthcoming. So speaking of that, you know, when it comes to AI and this current election, what\u2019s at stake?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, so there hasn\u2019t yet been this kind of sweeping foundational federal regulation yet. Congress has introduced a lot of bills, especially ones concerning deepfakes and AI safety, but in the interim we\u2019ve mostly had AI governance through executive order."},{"author":"","text":"So when the Trump administration was in power, they had two executive orders that they issued: one of them dealing with federal rules for AI, another one to support American innovation in AI. And that\u2019s a theme that both parties pick up on a lot, is support, whether that\u2019s funding or just creating avenues to get some really bright minds involved with AI."},{"author":"","text":"The Biden-Harris administration, in their executive order, was really focused on safety, if we\u2019re gonna make a contrast between the two approaches. They have acknowledged that, you know, this is a really powerful tool and it has implications at the highest level, from things like biosecurity, whether it\u2019s applying AI to things like drug discovery; down to how it affects individuals, whether that\u2019s through nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfakes, which, unfortunately, a lot of teenagers have heard of or been victims of. So there\u2019s this huge expanse of where AI can touch on people\u2019s lives, and that\u2019s something that you\u2019ll see come up with\u2014particularly with what Vice President Harris has been talking about in terms of AI."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, tell me more about how Trump and Harris\u2019s stance on AI differ. You know, what kind of policy do we think we could expect from either of these candidates?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, so Harris has talked a lot about AI safety. She led a U.S. delegation back in November [2023] to the U.K. first-of-its-kind global AI Safety Summit. And she framed the risks of AI as existential, which\u2014and I think when we think of these existential risks of AI, our minds might immediately go to these Terminator- or doomsday-like scenarios, but she brought it really down to earth to people [and] said, you know, \u201cIf you\u2019re a victim of an AI deepfake, that can be an existential kind of risk to you.\u201d So she has this kind of nuanced thought about it."},{"author":"","text":"And then in terms of safety, I mean, Trump has, in interviews, mentioned that AI is \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d"},{"author":"CLIP","text":"[: Donald Trump speaks on Fox Business in February: \u201cThe other thing that, I think, is maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything because there\u2019s no real solution\u2014the AI, as they call it, it is so scary.\u201d]"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"And I mean, I don\u2019t want to put a too fine point on it, but he kind of talked about it in these very vague terms, and, you, you know, he can ramble when he thinks things are interesting or peculiar or what have you, so I feel safe to say he hasn\u2019t thought about it in the same way that Vice President Harris has."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I wanted to touch on that, you know, idea of AI as an existential threat because I think it\u2019s so interesting that a few years ago, before AI was really this accessible, frictionless thing that was, integrated into so much software, the people talking about AI in the news were often these Big Tech folks sounding the alarm but always really evoking the kind of Skynet \u201csky is falling\u201d thing. And I wonder if they sort of did us a disservice by being so hyperbolic, so sci-fi nerd about what they said the concerns about AI would be versus the really real, you know, threats we\u2019re facing because of AI right now, which are kind of much more pedestrian, they\u2019re much more the threats we\u2019ve always faced on the Internet but turbocharged. You know, how has the conversation around what AI is and, like, what we should fear about AI changed?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, I think you\u2019re totally right that there\u2019s this narrative that we should fear AI because it\u2019s so powerful, and on some level that kind of plays a little bit into the hands of these leading AI tech companies, who want more investment in it ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"To say, \u201cHey, you know, give us more money because we\u2019ll make sure that our AI is safe. You know, don\u2019t give it to other people, but we\u2019re doing the big, dangerous safety things, but we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And it also plays up the idea that it is that powerful\u2014which, in most cases, it really is not; it\u2019s learning to do discrete tasks ..."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Right."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Increasingly well."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Right. But when you can kind of almost instantaneously make images that seem real or audio that seems real, that has power, too. And audio is an interesting case because it can be kind of tricky sometimes to tell if audio has been deepfaked; there are some tools that you can do it. With AI images, they\u2019ve gotten better. You know, it used to be like, oh, well, if the person has an extra thumb or something, it was pretty obvious. They have gotten better in the past two years. But audio, especially if you\u2019re not familiar with the speaker\u2019s voice, it can be tricky."},{"author":"","text":"In terms of misinformation, one of the big cases that we\u2019ve seen was Joe Biden\u2019s voice was deepfaked in New Hampshire. And one of the conspirators behind that was recently fined $6 million by the [Federal Communications Commission]. So what had happened was they had cloned Biden\u2019s voice, sent out all these messages to New Hampshire voters just telling them to stay home during the primary, you know, and I think the severe penalties and crackdowns on this show that, you know, folks like the FCC aren\u2019t messing around\u2014like: \u201cHere\u2019s this tool, it\u2019s being misapplied to our elections, and we\u2019re gonna throw the book at you.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely, it is very existentially threatening and scary, just in very different ways than, you know, headlines 10 years ago were promising."},{"author":"","text":"So let\u2019s talk more about how AI has been showing up in campaigns so far, both in terms of folks having to dodge deepfakes but also, you know, its deliberate use in some campaign PR."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Sure, yeah, so I think after Trump called AI \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cdangerous,\u201d there were some observers that said that those comments haven\u2019t stopped him from sharing AI-made memes on his platform, like Truth Social. And I don\u2019t know that necessarily, like, reflects anything about Trump himself in terms of AI. He just\u2014he\u2019s a poster; like, he posts memes. Whether they\u2019re made with AI or not, I don\u2019t know that he cares, but he\u2019s certainly been willing to use this tool. There are pictures of him riding a lion or playing a guitar with a storm trooper that have been circulated on social media. He himself on, it\u2019s either X or Truth Social, posted this picture that\u2019s clearly Kamala Harris speaking to an auditorium in Chicago, and there are the Soviet hammer and sickle flags flying, and it\u2019s clearly made by AI, so he has no compunctions about deploying memes in service of his campaign."},{"author":"","text":"I asked the Harris campaign about this because I haven\u2019t seen anything on Kamala Harris\u2019s feeds or in their campaign materials, and they told me, you know, they will not use AI-made text or, or images in their campaign. And I think, you know, that is internally coherent with what the vice president has said about the risks of this tool."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and I feel like a really infamous AI incident in the campaign so far has been the \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d thing, which did involve some real photos of independent Swifties making T-shirts that said \u201cSwiftie for Trump,\u201d which they are allowed to do, but then involved some AI-generated images that arguably pushed Taylor Swift to actually make an endorsement [laughs], which many people were not sure she was going to do."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. I think\u2014it was an AI-generated one, if\u2014let me\u2014if I\u2019m getting this right ..."},{"author":"Both","text":"It was, like, her as Uncle Sam."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, and then Trump says, \u201cI accept.\u201d And look, I mean, Taylor Swift, if you go back to the start of this year\u2014probably, I would argue, the most famous victim of sexually explicit deepfakes, right? So she has personally been a victim of this. And in her ultimate endorsement of Harris\u2014and she writes about this on Instagram: she says, you know, \u201cI have these fears about AI.\u201d And the false endorsement and false claims about her endorsement of Trump pushed her to publicly say, \u201cHey, you know, I\u2019ve done my research. You do your own. My conclusion is: I\u2019m voting for Harris.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, so possible that AI has, in a roundabout way, influenced the outcome of the election. We will see. But speaking of AI and the 2024 election, what\u2019s being done to combat AI-driven misinformation? \u2019Cause obviously, that\u2019s always an issue these days but feels particularly fraught around election time."},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, there are some campaigns out there to get voters aware of misinformation in the sort of highest level. I asked a misinformation and disinformation expert at the Brookings Institution\u2014she\u2019s a researcher named Valerie Wirtschafter\u2014about this. And she has studied misinformation in multiple elections, and her observation was: it hasn\u2019t been, necessarily, as bad as we feared quite yet. There was the robocall example I mentioned earlier. But beyond that, there haven\u2019t been too many terrible cases of misinformation leading people astray. You know, there are these isolated pockets of shared information on social media that is false. We saw that Russia had done a campaign to pay some right-wing influencers to promote some pro-Russian content. But in the biggest terms, I would say, it hasn\u2019t been quite so bad leading up to it."},{"author":"","text":"I do think that people can be aware of where they get their news sources. You can kind of be like a journalist and look at: \u201cOkay, well, where is this information coming from?\u201d I annoy my wife all the time\u2014she\u2019ll see something on the Internet, and I\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, who wrote that?\u201d Or like, \u201cWhere is it coming from on social media?\u201d you know."},{"author":"","text":"But Valerie had a key kind of point that I want to cook everybody\u2019s noodle with here, [which] is that the information leading up to the election might not be as bad as the misinformation after it, where it could be pretty easy to make an AI-generated image of people maybe rifling through ballots or something, and it\u2019s gonna be a politically intense time in November; tensions are gonna be high. There are guardrails in place to, in many mainstream systems, to make it difficult to make deepfakes of famous figures like Trump or Biden or Harris. Getting an AI to make an image of someone messing with a ballot box that you don\u2019t know could be easier. And so I would just say: We\u2019re not through the woods come [the first] Tuesday in November. Stay vigilant afterwards."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely. I think that that\u2019s really\u2014my noodle\u2019s cooked, for sure [laughs]."},{"author":"","text":"You know, I know you\u2019ve touched on this a bit already, but what can folks do to protect themselves from misinformation, but particularly involving AI, and protect themselves from, you know, things like deepfakes of themselves?"},{"author":"Guarino","text":"Yeah, well, let me start with deepfakes of themselves. I think that gets to the push to regulate this technology, to have protections in place so that when people use AI for bad things, they get punished. And there have been some, some bills on the federal level proposed to do that."},{"author":"","text":"In terms of staying vigilant, check where information is coming from. You know, the mainstream media, as often as it gets dinged and bruised, journalists there really care about getting things right, so I would say, you know, look for information that comes from vetted sources. I think often\u2014there\u2019s this scene in The Wire where one of the columnists, like, wakes up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night because he\u2019s worried that he\u2019s, like, transposed two figures, and, like, I felt that in my bones as a reporter, and, like\u2014and I think that goes to the level of, like, we really wanna get things right: here at Scientific American, at the Associated Press, at the New York Times, at the Wall Street Journal, blah, blah, blah. You know, like, people there in general and on an individual level, I think, really want to make sure that the information they\u2019re sharing with the world is accurate in a way that anonymous people on X, on Facebook maybe don\u2019t think about."},{"author":"","text":"So, you know, if you see something on Facebook, cool\u2014maybe don\u2019t let it inform how you\u2019re voting unless you go and check that against something else. And, you know, I know that puts a lot of onus on the individual, but in the absence of moderation\u2014and we\u2019ve seen that some of these companies don\u2019t really wanna invest in moderation the way that maybe they did 10 years ago; I don\u2019t exactly know the status of X\u2019s safety and moderation team currently, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as robust as it was at its peak. So the guardrails there in social media are maybe not as tight as they need to be."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Ben, thanks so much for coming in to chat.

And we\u2019re aware of the powers that it has, and with that power comes calls for governance."]},{"begin":"190.840","end":"208.320","lines":["Yeah.

So these are your ChatGPTs. These are your Google Geminis.

So if we live in this universe of big data, which people, I\u2019m sure, have heard before, and they\u2019re going back 20 years, there was this idea that pure data was like crude oil: it needed to be refined. And now we have AI that\u2019s refining it, and we can transform data into usable things."]},{"begin":"256.720","end":"300.960","lines":["So what\u2019s exciting, I think, with AI, and, you know, maybe people have experienced this the first time they\u2019ve used something like ChatGPT: you give it a prompt, and it comes out with this really\u2014at first glance, at least\u2014seemingly coherent text. And that\u2019s a really powerful feeling in a tool. And it\u2019s frictionless to use, so that, that\u2019s this term in technology where it\u2019s simple to use it; anybody with an Internet connection can go to OpenAI\u2019s website now, and it\u2019s being integrated in a lot of our software. So AI is in a lot of places, and that\u2019s why, I think, it\u2019s becoming this mainstream policy issue, is because you can\u2019t really turn on a phone or a computer and not touch on AI in, in some application."]},{"begin":"300.960","end":"311.080","lines":["Right, but I think a lot of the policy is still forthcoming.

So there\u2019s this huge expanse of where AI can touch on people\u2019s lives, and that\u2019s something that you\u2019ll see come up with\u2014particularly with what Vice President Harris has been talking about in terms of AI."]},{"begin":"398.440","end":"407.280","lines":["Yeah, tell me more about how Trump and Harris\u2019s stance on AI differ.

You know, there are these isolated pockets of shared information on social media that is false.
