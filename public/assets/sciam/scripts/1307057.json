Today we present the second of three episodes about AmazonFACE\u2014FACE is an acronym I\u2019ll explain later\u2014an experiment that could help forecast the future health of the Amazon forest\u2014and the rest of the planet as a result. The experiment\u2019s elaborate setup in six circular plots is almost done. Around the perimeter of each of the two plots that are closest to completion, 16 metal spires rise up off the forest floor, pierce the tree canopy and lord over the tallest crowns. The trees inside these circles have been monitored as closely as patients in an intensive care unit. Researchers have measured trunks, photographed roots, collected dead leaves and quantified sap flow. And now these experts are getting their first look at what, thanks to the cost of construction and long-term monitoring, Beto says are the world\u2019s most expensive square feet of jungle."

[CLIP: \u201cWorking It Out,\u201d by Jon Bj\u00f6rk] Amazon trees soak up more than a billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air every year and convert it into starches and sugars. The carbon in these compounds is sequestered for decades\u2014or even centuries\u2014in wood and soil, slowing the advance of global warming. But scientists worry that increasing temperatures and drought caused by climate change will weaken the forest. If that were to happen, this forest\u2019s ingesting of carbon could slow or stop entirely. And CO2 would build up faster in the atmosphere and worsen the climate emergency. Climate researchers realized decades ago that an experiment like this one was essential for forecasting the Amazon\u2019s future. But it took years to get traction. I first heard about the project in 2015, a couple of years after it got underway.

Looking down I saw beams of early morning sunlight bathing the canopy in orange. Next to me stood David Lapola, a climate scientist at Brazil\u2019s State University of Campinas and another of the project\u2019s leaders. He described to me one of his nightmares. It\u2019s called the dieback hypothesis. We heard about it briefly in Episode One."

    {
      "author": "Grossman",
      "text": "A dieback would occur if the Amazon jungle and global climate interact in a disastrous, vicious cycle. It would work like this: Hotter, drier weather caused by climate change weakens and kills Amazon trees, reducing the amount of CO2 from fossil fuel burning that the forest soaks up. As a result, more CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, which causes more warming, degrading the forest more, and so on, until this place\u2014and the rest of the planet\u2014is catastrophically hot."

      "text": "In the first episode of this miniseries I mentioned an important carbon fertilization experiment at Duke University. It started in the mid-1990s and continued for more than a decade. It showed that when sprayed with extra CO2, plots of pine trees grew faster and absorbed more carbon. The benefit of the carbon dioxide was sustained\u2014at least over the course of the experiment. It did vary from plot to plot, suggesting that other factors, like natural variation in water and nutrient availability, could affect how much of a boost trees get from additional CO2. What I didn\u2019t say was that a related experiment that started a couple of years later highlighted the important role that nutrients play. Plots of sweet gum trees in Tennessee that were sprayed with extra CO2 initially took up additional carbon. But after the first several years, the benefit dissipated. The researchers concluded that enhanced growth caused by the increase in CO2 reduced the supply of plant-available nitrogen in the soil. That, in turn, limited the benefit that extra carbon dioxide could provide. Will the Amazon see a benefit from extra CO2, like what happened at Duke? That could protect it from some of the hazards climate change is expected to continue bringing, like higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Or will it act more like the sweet gums in Tennessee and not get the long-term CO2 boost and the protection from climate change that could bring?"

      "text": "Researchers have called for this experiment for decades. But there are good reasons why nobody has conducted it before. Amazon trees are huge\u2014up to 110 feet tall here at ZF2\u2014so they require extra-large plots. That means bigger, more expensive gear for spraying CO2. Infrastructure such as roads and technical support is relatively poor. And funding for tropical forest research is scarce, a problem that we\u2019ll see hindered AmazonFACE. Incidentally, the \u201cFACE\u201d in AmazonFACE stands for Free-Air CO2 Enrichment. It\u2019s called \u201cfree air\u201d because the plots have no walls, making the experiment more realistic than any lab study. [CLIP: Bird vocalizations and other forest sounds]"

Several years earlier he and his collaborators had staked out the first two plots and had begun making measurements of the trees there, establishing their behavior under natural conditions. The researchers said the site could be the world\u2019s most intensely studied patch of tropical forest. Then in 2017 AmazonFACE ran out of money. David told me that they wanted about $20 million for construction and staff salaries, an amount that only a country or a very rich person could afford. But Brazil was in political turmoil. The president had recently been removed from office, and the government was stuck. Undaunted, David, Beto and their collaborators in the U.S. and Europe reached out to other governments."
