Let\u2019s start the day off right by catching up on some of the science news you may have missed last week. For Scientific American\u2019s  Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. This past Friday, a global outage hit Microsoft Windows devices and caused quite a kerfuffle. Flights all over the world were grounded as several major U.S. airlines, as well as a few international carriers, had problems with their computer systems. In several states 911 services were down on Friday morning, and some foreign banks reported outages, as did many medical facilities around the world. As of the time of this recording, the culprit seems to be a faulty software update pushed by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. While it\u2019s obviously a relief that there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything nefarious behind this huge disruption, it\u2019s unclear how long it\u2019s going to take all of the affected services to get back up and running. A reminder, we make this episode on Friday, so we\u2019ll definitely link to more up to date information in our show notes as it becomes available. Last week saw the premiere of the new movie Twisters, not to be confused with the old movie Twister. Now, I know that\u2019s not exactly science news, but it is a good excuse to talk about how tornadoes are shifting. Potentially, thanks to climate change. Last Monday at least 22 tornadoes hit the Chicago area. While the majority of tornadoes in the U.S. used to pop up from northern Texas to South Dakota\u2014which is why we call that area Tornado Alley\u2014twisters have been creeping east over the last few decades. And outbreaks, which is where multiple tornadoes spring out of a single storm system, are actually getting more common and moving eastward. That\u2019s a big problem because regions outside of Tornado Alley are way less likely to have infrastructure like storm shelters already in place. There\u2019s also evidence that twisters are more likely to happen at night in the southeast. That\u2019s for some complicated reasons involving evening driven intensification of an air current that carries moist air up from the gulf, but the important takeaway is that nighttime tornadoes are more than twice as likely to cause fatalities than ones that strike during the day If you want to learn more about the shifting science of tornadoes, check out the link in our show notes to see a short SciAm documentary that follows some of the brave and bold scientists who chase down twisters.

I\u2019ve got some bad news for your marine disaster movie screenplay: scientists say they\u2019re now able to predict so-called rogue waves up to five minutes in advance. A wave gets rogue status when it grows to double the average size of the tallest waves around it. These walls of water seem to come out of nowhere\u2014in fact, they often pop up in surprising directions relative to the waves around them and the prevailing winds. A study published last Thursday describes a neural network trained to suss out which waves hint that rogues might be on the way. To train it, the researchers fed the neural network around 14 million different 30-minute-long strings of sea-surface-elevation data from 172 buoys. The researchers say their tool could predict 75 percent of rogue waves 60 seconds in advance and 73 percent with five minutes\u2019 notice. The tool even had similar success predicting a few rogue waves based on data from buoys that weren\u2019t used to train the neural network. But the system gobble up a bunch more data before it can warn ships in all oceans across the globe. I don\u2019t have a good segue for this that doesn\u2019t reference the movie Moonfall, so let\u2019s just dig in: data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has apparently revealed evidence of a cave on the moon. The data leads them to believe that the deep Mare Tranquillitatis pit leads to a cave at least 130 feet wide, which is almost enough to squeeze in two whole tennis courts end to end\u2014so much room for activities! That\u2019s actually kind of exactly what the researchers said, though, without the tennis part. They suggested that future astronauts might use the structures as a natural shelter. These caves could help protect them from cosmic radiation and temperature fluctuations on the surface.There are more than 200 pits on the moon that we already know about possibly formed by past volcanic activity, and scientists are excited to see whether they might also feature cave systems and secret tunnels. Let\u2019s make a quick pit stop for some public health news before we get back to the stars. I could give you a whole laundry list of updates about measles and bird flu, etc, but for this week I\u2019ll keep it simple. Don\u2019t pick up a raw milk habit. It is simply not the time. If you\u2019re concerned about industrial farming, I absolutely hear you. Find a small local farm you like the look of that also pasteurizes their dairy and go buy milk from them. Everybody wins. Also, vaccinate your kids! It\u2019s wild out there, but today we\u2019re going to focus on COVID, which, yes, is still very much a thing. Take it from me, a person with a very silly list of chronic illness symptoms that several very smart doctors tell me is largely thanks to my \u201cminor\u201d run-ins with COVID. How fun. Last Wednesday a new study on long COVID came out in the New England Journal of Medicine, and a lot of the headlines about it are focusing on the fact that the risk of long COVID seems to have dropped as the virus evolved, but even more so as folks got vaccinated. That\u2019s true\u2014and it\u2019s also great news\u2014but the study also noted an ongoing \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of chronic, debilitating symptoms. And, yeah, COVID seems to be surging again. According to the CDC, wastewater testing currently shows \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels of coronavirus activity in at least half the states in the U.S. And President Joe Biden made headlines last Wednesday when he tested positive for COVID after displaying mild symptoms. Photos showed him exiting a car, surrounded by Secret Service, and then entering Air Force One, all without wearing a mask. Dear Mr. President: Please mask up! The evidence is clear: masks help us lower our risk of transmission and having mild symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t make someone else seriously ill, especially in the long term. And hey, listeners, I know it can feel like a pain. I really do. But I would honestly consider it a personal favor to me if you started wearing masks again, at least in enclosed spaces and among crowds, and especially if you have the sniffles and you can\u2019t stay home. Okay? All right. Now I think we could all use a little space. The annual Perseid meteor shower is here and sticking around until late August, so get outside and peep some shooting stars. This annual spectacle comes to us courtesy of Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. The comet itself takes 133 years to orbit the sun and last made a near pass by us in 1992, so we won\u2019t see it up close again for a long time. But Swiftie also leaves a trail of dust and debris along its orbital path that Earth passes through each year. When those cosmic dust bunnies collide with our atmosphere, they burn up so dramatically that we literally make wishes on them. That\u2019s a pretty theatrical end for what\u2019s basically a clod of space dirt. The shower is expected to peak on the evening of August 11 for folks in the U.S., and that big show could feature anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred shooting stars every hour. But you can start keeping an eye out for meteors anytime you please. NASA\u2019s advice is that you get to the darkest location you can to improve your visibility, aim for nights with clear skies, and settle in for a long evening. Meteors get easier to spot as your eyes adjust to the dark, so you don\u2019t want to rush it. Plus, you might need to spend quite a while staring at the sky if you want to catch some, depending on how much comet trash we happen to be obliterating on any given evening. So, bring a blanket, some warm layers, snacks and drinks, and friends to make the most of the night. Then look towards the constellation Perseus, which is where the meteors will appear to originate. That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s News Roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday with an expert on advanced meditation who wants to teach us all how to change our minds for the better. And hey, if you\u2019ve got a second, do me a favor and rate and review us wherever you\u2019re listening to the show right now. It really helps us find new listeners.

Monday, listeners! Let\u2019s start the day off right by catching up on some of the science news you may have missed last week. For Scientific American\u2019s  Science Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. This past Friday, a global outage hit Microsoft Windows devices and caused quite a kerfuffle. Flights all over the world were grounded as several major U.S. airlines, as well as a few international carriers, had problems with their computer systems. In several states 911 services were down on Friday morning, and some foreign banks reported outages, as did many medical facilities around the world. As of the time of this recording, the culprit seems to be a faulty software update pushed by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. While it\u2019s obviously a relief that there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything nefarious behind this huge disruption, it\u2019s unclear how long it\u2019s going to take all of the affected services to get back up and running. A reminder, we make this episode on Friday, so we\u2019ll definitely link to more up to date information in our show notes as it becomes available. Last week saw the premiere of the new movie Twisters, not to be confused with the old movie Twister. Now, I know that\u2019s not exactly science news, but it is a good excuse to talk about how tornadoes are shifting. Potentially, thanks to climate change. Last Monday at least 22 tornadoes hit the Chicago area. While the majority of tornadoes in the U.S. used to pop up from northern Texas to South Dakota\u2014which is why we call that area Tornado Alley\u2014twisters have been creeping east over the last few decades. And outbreaks, which is where multiple tornadoes spring out of a single storm system, are actually getting more common and moving eastward. That\u2019s a big problem because regions outside of Tornado Alley are way less likely to have infrastructure like storm shelters already in place. There\u2019s also evidence that twisters are more likely to happen at night in the southeast. That\u2019s for some complicated reasons involving evening driven intensification of an air current that carries moist air up from the gulf, but the important takeaway is that nighttime tornadoes are more than twice as likely to cause fatalities than ones that strike during the day If you want to learn more about the shifting science of tornadoes, check out the link in our show notes to see a short SciAm documentary that follows some of the brave and bold scientists who chase down twisters.

I\u2019ve got some bad news for your marine disaster movie screenplay: scientists say they\u2019re now able to predict so-called rogue waves up to five minutes in advance. A wave gets rogue status when it grows to double the average size of the tallest waves around it. These walls of water seem to come out of nowhere\u2014in fact, they often pop up in surprising directions relative to the waves around them and the prevailing winds. A study published last Thursday describes a neural network trained to suss out which waves hint that rogues might be on the way. To train it, the researchers fed the neural network around 14 million different 30-minute-long strings of sea-surface-elevation data from 172 buoys. The researchers say their tool could predict 75 percent of rogue waves 60 seconds in advance and 73 percent with five minutes\u2019 notice. The tool even had similar success predicting a few rogue waves based on data from buoys that weren\u2019t used to train the neural network. But the system gobble up a bunch more data before it can warn ships in all oceans across the globe. I don\u2019t have a good segue for this that doesn\u2019t reference the movie Moonfall, so let\u2019s just dig in: data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has apparently revealed evidence of a cave on the moon. The data leads them to believe that the deep Mare Tranquillitatis pit leads to a cave at least 130 feet wide, which is almost enough to squeeze in two whole tennis courts end to end\u2014so much room for activities! That\u2019s actually kind of exactly what the researchers said, though, without the tennis part. They suggested that future astronauts might use the structures as a natural shelter. These caves could help protect them from cosmic radiation and temperature fluctuations on the surface.There are more than 200 pits on the moon that we already know about possibly formed by past volcanic activity, and scientists are excited to see whether they might also feature cave systems and secret tunnels. Let\u2019s make a quick pit stop for some public health news before we get back to the stars. I could give you a whole laundry list of updates about measles and bird flu, etc, but for this week I\u2019ll keep it simple. Don\u2019t pick up a raw milk habit. It is simply not the time. If you\u2019re concerned about industrial farming, I absolutely hear you. Find a small local farm you like the look of that also pasteurizes their dairy and go buy milk from them. Everybody wins. Also, vaccinate your kids! It\u2019s wild out there, but today we\u2019re going to focus on COVID, which, yes, is still very much a thing. Take it from me, a person with a very silly list of chronic illness symptoms that several very smart doctors tell me is largely thanks to my \u201cminor\u201d run-ins with COVID. How fun. Last Wednesday a new study on long COVID came out in the New England Journal of Medicine, and a lot of the headlines about it are focusing on the fact that the risk of long COVID seems to have dropped as the virus evolved, but even more so as folks got vaccinated. That\u2019s true\u2014and it\u2019s also great news\u2014but the study also noted an ongoing \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of chronic, debilitating symptoms. And, yeah, COVID seems to be surging again. According to the CDC, wastewater testing currently shows \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels of coronavirus activity in at least half the states in the U.S. And President Joe Biden made headlines last Wednesday when he tested positive for COVID after displaying mild symptoms. Photos showed him exiting a car, surrounded by Secret Service, and then entering Air Force One, all without wearing a mask. Dear Mr. President: Please mask up! The evidence is clear: masks help us lower our risk of transmission and having mild symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t make someone else seriously ill, especially in the long term. And hey, listeners, I know it can feel like a pain. I really do. But I would honestly consider it a personal favor to me if you started wearing masks again, at least in enclosed spaces and among crowds, and especially if you have the sniffles and you can\u2019t stay home. Okay? All right. Now I think we could all use a little space. The annual Perseid meteor shower is here and sticking around until late August, so get outside and peep some shooting stars. This annual spectacle comes to us courtesy of Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. The comet itself takes 133 years to orbit the sun and last made a near pass by us in 1992, so we won\u2019t see it up close again for a long time. But Swiftie also leaves a trail of dust and debris along its orbital path that Earth passes through each year. When those cosmic dust bunnies collide with our atmosphere, they burn up so dramatically that we literally make wishes on them. That\u2019s a pretty theatrical end for what\u2019s basically a clod of space dirt. The shower is expected to peak on the evening of August 11 for folks in the U.S., and that big show could feature anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred shooting stars every hour. But you can start keeping an eye out for meteors anytime you please. NASA\u2019s advice is that you get to the darkest location you can to improve your visibility, aim for nights with clear skies, and settle in for a long evening. Meteors get easier to spot as your eyes adjust to the dark, so you don\u2019t want to rush it. Plus, you might need to spend quite a while staring at the sky if you want to catch some, depending on how much comet trash we happen to be obliterating on any given evening. So, bring a blanket, some warm layers, snacks and drinks, and friends to make the most of the night. Then look towards the constellation Perseus, which is where the meteors will appear to originate. That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s News Roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday with an expert on advanced meditation who wants to teach us all how to change our minds for the better. And hey, if you\u2019ve got a second, do me a favor and rate and review us wherever you\u2019re listening to the show right now. It really helps us find new listeners.
