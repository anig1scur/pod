He heads up the scientific consulting company Borneo Futures."},{"author":"Meijaard","text":"It\u2019s hot and sweaty and humid, but there\u2019s so much diversity in these forests.

Everything\u2019s just chirping away. It\u2019s just this giant bastion of life."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"That life is on the brink, because Laurance says Indonesia has an incredible concentration of the world\u2019s endangered and critically endangered species. It\u2019s..."},{"author":"Laurance","text":"Sort of an incredible, magical place, in one sense, but one that\u2019s greatly imperiled right now."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And then there\u2019s another sort of peril\u2014one facing the scientists who do conservation work there. That\u2019s the topic of a recent letter Laurance and Meijaard published in the journal Current Biology. Writing with several Indonesian colleagues, they warn that conservation science in the island nation is under threat."},{"author":"Laurance","text":"We were seeing colleagues and researchers we knew and respected being essentially booted out of Indonesia..."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Including Meijaard himself."},{"author":"Meijaard","text":"We published a critical letter in an Indonesian newspaper where we questioned the Ministry of Forestry and Environment\u2019s statements about growing orangutan populations, and we said, \u201cLook, we\u2019ve been looking at this problem for over 30 years, and orangutan populations are simply not growing.... All three species of orangutans are in continuous decline.\u201d"},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"He says the government responded quickly by banning him and his colleagues from doing research in the country. A leaked letter from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry instructs the country\u2019s national parks not to work with Meijaard or approve his research requests, saying his writings could \u201cdiscredit the government.\u201d"},{"author":"Meijaard","text":"And it\u2019s really made it much more difficult to collaborate with foreign and Indonesian scientists working on conservation issues in Indonesia."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"We reached out to the Indonesian government but have not, at time of publication, received a response. The scientists\u2019 paper in Current Biology points out that Indonesia is far from the only country suppressing scientific work. They cite examples from Turkey, Sweden, the U.S. and Australia, too. But in a nation such as Indonesia, with so much biodiversity on the brink, the stakes for endangered species are especially high."},{"author":"Meijaard","text":"If everyone says that orangutan populations are growing, and no one is there to question that, then orangutan populations \u201care\u201d growing."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And that perception becomes reality, he says."},{"author":"Meijaard","text":"Without independent science, the government and other groups can completely change the narrative and generate fake realities about what is happening."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"And in a world where fake realities have been used to discredit lifesaving vaccines or to undermine free and fair elections, it\u2019s easy to imagine how \u201cfake realities\u201d about the state of Indonesia\u2019s forests could have very real repercussions for critically endangered species.
