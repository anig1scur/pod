I\u2019m Hal Whitehead. I\u2019m a professor of biology at Dalhousie University in Canada. That was a fundamental discovery. And then we began to show that there were a number of other behavioral characteristics which differed between the, between the clans ..."

      "text": "These marine mammals are very hard to observe, but in the past two decades the roughly 20 or so people in the world who study sperm whales have found some compelling evidence of culture among them. Hal summarized these findings in a review paper published in Royal Society Open Science in January. And he asked a natural follow-up question: What can we learn by comparing human and sperm whale cultures? For Science, Quickly, I\u2019m Joseph Polidoro. Sperm whales use short strings of distinct clicks, known as codas, to signal their membership in a clan. [Clip: Sperm Whale vocalization] Scientists also use these click sequences to differentiate between sperm whale clans, naming each group after an attribute of their respective coda."

      "author": "Polidoro",
      "text": "Some clans are so large and widespread that many of their members may never meet. But if they did, they\u2019d recognize each other as belonging to the same group, just like a New Yorker and a Texan connecting over their shared American English while traveling abroad. Sperm whales\u2019 basic social unit, the pod, comprises about 10 females and their offspring. Clans are much larger. On average ..."

    {
      "author": "Polidoro",
      "text": "The persistence of lactose tolerance in the past 10,000 years is tied to agriculture, and this adaptation may have helped humans survive during famines. The vocal culture of sperm whales appears to help them survive, too."

      "text": "These animals depend heavily on each other. Without each other, they\u2019re probably not going to live long, and their offspring aren\u2019t going to survive. And so this bonding is vital. And the codas are an important way they do it. That sets up these patterns of cooperation and collaboration in groups, which are so important to the whales."

      "author": "Polidoro",
      "text": "Andy adds that there are a couple of different things we can learn from studying animal culture. Studying the cultural traits we share with our closest living relatives, other primates, sends us down one path of discovery."

We don\u2019t share a close relative with meerkats, which teach their young how to remove stingers from scorpions before eating them, but both humans and meerkats are predators."

And if his paper raises at least as many questions as it answers, well, that may be kind of the point. It\u2019s a call to go deeper, to resist generalizations, to think harder about the diversity of all cultures."
