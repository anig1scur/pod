I'm Rachel Feldman. I love spending time in nature, but that can feel really hard to do when you live in a city, even out in the suburbs. It's tough to feel like you're really outside when you're outside, but if you start thinking like an urban naturalist, you can find wildlife to appreciate everywhere you go."},{"author":"","text":"My guest today is Ryan Mandelbaum. They're a science writer, naturalist and educator based in New York City. Their new book, Wild NYC, is a guide to exploring the natural wonders of the big Apple. But they've also got tons of great tips on how to find wildlife in any built environment, because if you can find nature in New York City, you really can find it anywhere."},{"author":"","text":"Earlier this month, we took a walk through New York City's Prospect Park with Ryan to learn how to approach urban and suburban environments like a naturalist. Bear in mind that we recorded this while walking around outside, so it's gonna sound pretty different from our usual in studio episodes. But you can also check out a video version with lots of cool plants and animals to look at over on our YouTube channel."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hey, y\u2019all, we are here in Prospect Park with Ryan Mandelbaum, the author of a book called Wild NYC that\u2019s all about finding wildlife even in urban spaces. Ryan, tell us a little bit about the book and what we\u2019re gonna do here today."},{"author":"Ryan Mandelbaum","text":"Yeah, so Wild NYC is part natural history, part field guide, part trip planner about New York City. There\u2019s a lot of really interesting things to see but [also] a lot of really interesting things to talk about, so we\u2019re gonna experience some of that here in Prospect Park."},{"author":"","text":"Prospect Park is Brooklyn\u2019s backyard. It also has the biggest forest in Brooklyn, and it\u2019s the place where I probably spend most of my time as a naturalist. So there\u2019s interesting plants, animals, interactions between us and those plants and animals, so I\u2019m really excited to show you all what we have here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Cool, let\u2019s get started."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"The one thing I\u2019m always doing as a naturalist is trying my best not to be completely distracted by all of the things that are happening at once. So even right now there\u2019s probably, like, five or 10 bird species that I\u2019m experiencing and a lot of plants. The birds I\u2019m looking at are a common grackle\u2014that little man running around on the ground."},{"author":"","text":"A lot of the birds that we see here are ones that are more commonly associated with people. So common grackle are often seen in areas that are kind of cleared open: farms or just places where we\u2019ve altered. And the other bird that\u2019s running around on the ground here is a European starling. They are an introduced species. The legend is that somebody wanted all of the birds of Shakespeare ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"To be in the United States, and so they introduced them all, and starlings were the one that stuck. The actual story is, like, so much worse than that, which is that there were entire societies devoted to making the United States look like Europe, and as part of that they introduced starlings, like, multiple times, and so now we have just, like, millions of starlings. They\u2019re very, very common in Europe, and so now they\u2019re very, very common here."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s interesting because as a naturalist a lot of what I\u2019m thinking about isn\u2019t just, like, the stories of these species but how they interact with the world at large. And so you can\u2019t really hate starlings because they\u2019re really cute [laughs] and have a lot of personality. I have one who\u2019ll, like, perch on my air conditioner and sing a bunch of weird noises\u2014they\u2019re mimics, so they can sing other bird songs really well. But then they also are cavity nesters, and so they\u2019ll take cavities from our native birds that use cavities like bluebirds and redheaded woodpeckers. The animal itself is not good or bad; the animal itself is a doofy little guy that runs around on the ground. But, you know, it can do good or bad things, usually based on us."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What are some other animals that people in urban areas might be particularly likely to find?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"I think American robins are pretty common, like, first birds you notice because they\u2019re often present in backyards. American robin is a native bird to the United States, as is the common grackle. They like sort of big open areas. They love plucking for worms in the dirt. There they are [laughs]."},{"author":"","text":"An interesting thing about the city is that there\u2019s a huge combination of both native plants and invasive plants and introduced plants. People like to put value on everything, like, \u201cOh, is this one introduced? Oh, it\u2019s bad. This one is native. It\u2019s good.\u201d Good and bad are kind of, like, our value judgments, so there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. Something can be introduced and not necessarily bad, and then something can be, like, \u201cnative,\u201d but then because of our doing suddenly it\u2019s\u2014gets to the wrong place and takes over and it\u2019s bad, so ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"We\u2019re standing under what I assume is an eastern white pine. Eastern white pine, you can tell by the number of needles."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, yeah, I see five."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"It\u2019s an eastern white pine\u2014looky, looky. Most of the eastern white pines here are planted; they\u2019re more common, like, north of here. But they\u2019re a good tree. They go real big [laughs]. Their pine cones are real big. You can tell it\u2019s an eastern white pine when the needles are long and floppy and they\u2019re kind of soft. I just like \u2019em. I like conifer trees \u2019cause they got green on \u2019em all year long, so even in the winter they\u2019re exciting and green."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So how did you get interested in, you know, being a naturalist as a born and bred New Yorker?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"I\u2019m not from New York City proper; I\u2019m from, like, a town that touches New York City. So I always have to clarify that \u2019cause then real New Yorkers get mad at me. But I\u2019ve always liked walking around in the city and exploring places I hadn\u2019t been before. And then while I was in grad school I was writing about herons because I found out that New York City Bird Alliance was, like, painting lawn flamingos to look like herons and egrets to try and, like, coax them back onto one of the marsh islands. And that was, like, the exact kind of wacky, silly story that made me like, \u201cHuh, tell me about [laughs] why they\u2019re painting lawn flamingos.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so I went on this, like, excursion to Staten Island to try and find my own great blue heron. And then it, like, turns out that they\u2019re just in the parks [laughs]. Like, you can often just see them, like, in Central Park, Prospect Park. And I think since then it\u2019s, like, really warped the way I think about New York City as, like, not just a place that I\u2019m eating dinner in and going to shows in but, like, a place that has its own natural history and really exciting interactions between humans and animals that I just found fascinating."},{"author":"","text":"First, you get hit with the birder bug, where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my God, I need to see every single bird.\u201d And then you get hit with the everything bug, where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my God, I need to see everything.\u201d [Laughs] And that, that would be how I got here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what are the kinds of things that, you know, your book helps people look out for? I know there are birds, there\u2019s some plants."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"I mean, what I really want people to do is walk around the city and understand, like, appreciate what it is now and the amount of diversity that\u2019s here, both in terms of, like, what people have done to it and how animals are adapting to it, but also understand just how biodiverse it\u2019s always been."},{"author":"","text":"New York City is kind of at the confluence of a lot of different eco areas\u2014so there\u2019s ocean and land; there\u2019s north and south; there\u2019s, you know, humid and dry; there\u2019s all sorts of, you might say, like, transitional areas here in the city. And so it\u2019s always, for all of history, attracted, like, a ton of biodiversity. You know, there\u2019s been human habitation here for millennia, and so just getting people to understand New York as more than just this concrete jungle but actually, like, a really amazing, biodiverse place, even today, is what I\u2019m excited about."},{"author":"","text":"That is a red-bellied woodpecker that just flew up there. Can you see it? Try to look at it without binoculars first. That\u2019s my tip ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"With binoculars. There it is ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, yeah."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"It\u2019s coming up, yeah. There it is. You see it\u2019s got the little red head, grayish belly, black back with white stripes."},{"author":"","text":"They\u2019re probably one of our most common woodpeckers we regularly see. But that wouldn\u2019t have been the case, like, a hundred years ago; they\u2019re very much a product of human altering the habitat and climate change. So they would have been, like, a more of a southern woodpecker, but then they respond well to human alterations of habitats, kinda like the robins and grackles and them. You see them commonly in suburbs, and they\u2019re really sensitive to cold temperature."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"So as the climate changed and things warmed up they started moving north, and we\u2019re still starting\u2014they\u2019re still moving north today; like, areas in the northern United States and Canada that wouldn\u2019t have seen them before starting to get them."},{"author":"","text":"They\u2019re also an example of how ornithologists are really bad at naming birds. Like, look at that bird. What would you call it if you didn\u2019t know what it was called?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Like, a, a red, redheaded ..."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Like, a redheaded woodpecker."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Something. Yeah."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Yeah, I would call it that, too. There\u2019s already a redheaded woodpecker, and it\u2019s not that one."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Oh, dang."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"I know. And so it\u2019s called the red belly woodpecker because [laughs] often what would happen is, like, an 1800s ornithologist would, like, shoot a bunch of birds at random and then bring \u2019em back to their house and look at them and be like, \u201cOh, this one seems to have a little pink wash on its belly that you can only see if you\u2019re, like, looking at a dead one like this.\u201d So they got \u201cred-bellied woodpecker.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"I would\u2019ve called it, yeah, like, you know ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Red, red-capped woodpecker."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Red-capped, black-striped awesome [laughs] little guy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]I feel like so much of what our idea of doing nature and being a naturalist is comes from, you know, that era of very, very rich people shooting birds [laughs] and writing stuff down about them. How would you like to, to change people\u2019s conceptions of, of what it is to enjoy the outdoors?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"I think the thing we\u2019re doing right now is a good way to change the perception of the outdoors. Going on your own sort of discovery missions or experiencing nature yourself and building your own personal connection to it is really important. If you really wanna, like, discover new stuff, you could look at anything. I look at birds \u2019cause they\u2019re easy to look at and there\u2019s a lot of infrastructure for looking at birds. People who look at mushrooms and fungus here in New York City are, like, really interesting."},{"author":"","text":"The city, if\u2014I treat it as [as] interesting a place ecologically as the forest surrounding it, and in many cases the biodiversity is actually higher here because [of] the amount of things we bring here and, again, because New York is already a pretty rich place ecologically. So just get started looking at stuff, walk slowly, experience the smells and sounds."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And what about for folks who are like, \u201cYeah, of course, New York City has these giant parks that are, like, full of wildlife, but what about me in, you know, (insert smaller city), where we don\u2019t have a giant green space?\u201d Like, what advice do you have for people in other urban areas?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Well, first come to New York City [laughs]. No, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m really excited about about my book is that, of course, it\u2019s about New York City, but it\u2019s really about the interactions between what happens when humans enter a natural place\u2014just really considering that humans are part of nature and when we change it it\u2019s because we\u2019re a species that lives there. So you, too, can go out in any place where you are and look at what\u2019s around."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s plenty of really awesome resources that allow you to look more locally. I use iNaturalist. It\u2019s an app that uses the help of both AI and a community of naturalists to help you identify things. And this book happens to be of a series of Wild (Enter Your City Name Here) books, so I think my publisher would probably tell you to buy the book for your city [laughs]."},{"author":"","text":"Estuaries, which are places where the freshwater rivers meet saltwater oceans, often are some of the most biodiverse places in the world, and many of the world\u2019s largest cities are on estuaries. So generally your city probably will have quite a lot of really interesting things to look at, regardless of where you live."},{"author":"","text":"Onward and upward. This tree here, what a tree this is [laughs]. So London plane is a hybrid of two sycamore species, one from our continent and one from East Asia. London plane was Robert Moses\u2019s favorite tree because it can grow really well everywhere. It likes\u2014it doesn\u2019t care about the sidewalk, doesn\u2019t care about anything ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, like Robert Moses."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Like Robert Moses [laughs]. It\u2019s like Robert Moses if he was a tree. So we see quite a lot of them. It is\u2014supposedly the leaf of the London plane is the logo of the Parks Department here in New York City. The London plane is not a very good tree for insects, so it\u2019s therefore not a really good tree for wildlife."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"But there is some random moth that we see on it a lot that\u2019s native that was just like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll deal with that.\u201d [Laughs] And it\u2019s a really pretty one."},{"author":"","text":"All right, let\u2019s keep going. There\u2019s a lawn. Lawns usually are, like, monocultures designed for use by people only, and as much as they look big and green, and people are like, \u201cGo touch grass,\u201d they actually are not quite as good for nature as everywhere else. You\u2019re much better off planting, like, a native flower garden or letting the lawn even just grow rather than using all of this water and mowing resources to make a big lawn. I know that this is controversial, but lawns are, like, they\u2019re fine [laughs]. I get it\u2014I like sitting. You know, sitting\u2019s great."},{"author":"","text":"Here\u2019s a hawk. There it is. Way far away, up in the sky, over that plane."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"It\u2019s probably our\u2014I would say it\u2019s a red-tailed hawk, but I ha\u2014it\u2019s really backlit and far away."},{"author":"","text":"They are similarly a hawk that\u2019s okay with humans altering the habitat. So often what the red-tailed hawks will do is nest over on the\u2014like, in these pine trees over here. Here\u2019s another one. There\u2019s two of \u2019em. They don\u2019t mind the lawns. They are, like, eating squirrels and other little things. I just got a look at the other one; it is also a red-tailed hawk. Red-tailed hawks, the females are bigger than the males, so the big one was the female, and the smaller one is the male."},{"author":"","text":"Like, as a birder, what I wanna see when I\u2019m on the lawn is, like, eastern bluebirds, eastern meadowlarks. There\u2019s, like, these\u2014New York doesn\u2019t have, like, a ton of big grasslands, especially not in, like, the middle of the boroughs, so I\u2019m not usually expecting to see any of those birds here in the park except on migration on this lawn."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s some birds\u2014robins. Oh, a flicker way out there. You may think of woodpeckers as tree birds, but one of our species of woodpecker, while it does like trees, it also loves the dirt. The ones that are sort of bigger and hunched over and have red on only the back of their heads are flickers. So yeah, it\u2019s a woodpecker that likes the dirt. My spouse calls them \u201cdirtpeckers\u201d \u2019cause they hang out on the ground and eat\u2014feed like the robins."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Are there particularly good times of year to go looking for wildlife in urban areas?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Yes, it actually depends on what you wanna see. So right now, early April, is probably\u2014we\u2019re just getting started with bird migration so our early species like the flickers migrate around now, so we\u2019re starting to see a lot of them. Some of the sparrow species are starting to migrate. It\u2019s not the peak yet. But if you want something to look at that\u2019s special in April, the salamanders are moving right now."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"And I just went on a really fun tour of New York City\u2019s Alley Pond Park, where you can find a couple species of native salamander\u2014most common is red-backed salamander and spotted salamander\u2014and we found them. It was awesome."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] I feel like salamanders are a thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize are in their cities."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Oh, yeah. At least here in the eastern United States, I think that the animal that [with], like, the highest amount of biomass in the eastern forest is the red-backed salamander."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Salamanders are sensitive, though, to, like, pollution and habitat fragmentation, so they\u2019re actually not especially common in the core of the boroughs. The only place that you can see red-backed salamanders reliably in Brooklyn is, like, one pond in Green-Wood Cemetery. Outside the outskirts of the city\u2014so Staten Island, the Bronx, parts of Queens, especially northeastern Queens\u2014there are places where you can see multiple species of salamander."},{"author":"","text":"And this is also one thing I try and touch on in the book is that at the edges of the boroughs, there are places where you can see, really, this kind of transition and interaction between humans and the natural world at its strongest because there are these places where it\u2019s, like, mostly really pristine eastern forest but then a lot of introduced stuff kind of creeping in, and so you can kind of see those two things interact, like trees surrounded by invasive vines or fights between native animals and introduced animals for nest space. You can still kind of capture that amazing biodiversity of New York City while also seeing some of the human influence there."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s a chipping sparrow. That\u2019s what this little guy right here is. Chipping sparrows are pretty common. In an unaltered world they would probably be our most common sparrow in North America."},{"author":"","text":"Welcome to the woods. The wooded area here is nice because it features what I\u2019m pretty sure is a stream that\u2019s fed by, like, New York City water supply that ends up becoming two ponds and then a river through the woods back there. So for us this is kind of one of the better places to experience nature in the city because there\u2019s quite a lot of different plants and animals."},{"author":"","text":"What I\u2019m usually looking for here is migratory birds, who might come down to take a bath in some of these streams over here, and then some of our native plants, which there\u2019s some nice flowering plants that you might, might catch one if it\u2019s around."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s you. So it\u2019s just starting to flower. Smell, smell that right there."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Oh, yeah. This is spicebush. So spicebush is a native plant to our area. It flowers really early, so you can see it\u2019s just starting to flower. It flowers in early April. A lot of plants will flower early on just because that way they can take advantage of the sun when the canopy isn\u2019t all leafed out."},{"author":"","text":"Spicebush is, like, amazing. First, first of all, you can\u2019t see it, but it smells really good [laughs]. Its bark would\u2019ve been used extensively by Indigenous people here. And then in the fall it creates these, like, beautiful red berries, which are edible. But what you would do with them if you wanted to use them was dry \u2019em out and use \u2019em as spice, and they have a flavor that\u2019s kind of like allspice, cinnamon and black pepper all wrapped in one."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mmm."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"It\u2019s the best."},{"author":"","text":"You wanna look at the wood ducks? Wood ducks are really good ducks. There\u2019s also a ring-necked duck over there, which is pretty uncommon for Prospect Park."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Beautiful."},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Beautiful. They\u2019re really common in the rest of the areas, but here in New York City, we don\u2019t see them that often, so that ring-necked duck is a special site for birders. This is around the time of year that we see them on migration. Usually there\u2019s a couple that roll through all the parks every year."},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s a yellow-bellied sapsucker that is calling above us. It is a woodpecker. I often interact with other human beings when I\u2019m birding because I look weird [laughs]. And so a guy\u2019ll come along\u2014and I don\u2019t know why old-timey New Yorkers have, like, figured this one out\u2014but they\u2019ll go up, and they\u2019ll be, \u201cAy, you see any yellow-bellied sapsuckers?\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cI know you\u2019re making fun of me, but yeah [laughs], there\u2019s one right here.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Imagine this: It\u2019s all of time and you\u2019re a bird. You migrate up, and you end up in this verdant, beautiful New York City ecosystem. You stop by just to refuel. Then you go to your, you know, breeding area north of here. We come in, we replace it all with concrete. We leave, like, four green spaces [laughs]. Birds still have to migrate through, and so they get concentrated into our parks. So in May, September the parks are just loaded with, you know, these birds that have come all the way up from the equatorial regions, the tropics, migrating to these boreal habitats or the tundra or the northern woods, and they stop here, and so you can see, like, 120 species of bird in a day here in, in May. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just an incredible phenomenon: there\u2019s birds singing and flying around, and they\u2019re all crazy colors. That\u2019s the best."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What would you say are kind of big pitfalls to avoid as a person trying to appreciate wildlife? What things should we try not to do so that we don\u2019t cause harm?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Leaving things the way you found it is, in the broadest sense, is a really good one. If you flip a log to see if there\u2019s, like, a lizard underneath it, flip it back. Don\u2019t pick wild flowers. Just general \u201cbe nice to nature and nature will be nice to you back.\u201d This is more for your own safety, but definitely just follow the rules of the park and obey the law. One thing that I found [laughs] is really nice in New York City is that when you do this enough, you eventually get to know a lot of the folks who work in conservation and for the city and, you know, a lot of the folks who are around, and being friends with them opens up more opportunities to look for nature and wildlife."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s a lot of really cool nature groups. Most cities have at least some birding clubs. Some of them have groups that are specific\u2014if, you know, you are queer or a person of color, you might be able to find a community of folks who are going out every day looking at, you know, birds and wildlife and plants and things like that. And for me the community has been probably my favorite part of it. Just\u2014I\u2019ve made so many friends simply by going outside all the time and looking at interesting things, and I would encourage other folks to, you know, open up their hearts and minds to all the other weirdos out here looking at the world."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So we\u2019ve talked about, you know, how interesting it is that there\u2019s so much diversity here, including stuff we\u2019ve introduced. What about things we\u2019ve introduced that are not so good?"},{"author":"Mandelbaum","text":"Humans have the ability to alter ecosystems in a way that most other animals can\u2019t, and with us we will sometimes move things around the world that can cause outsized negative impacts. The place where some of these invasive insect infestations started, some of them started in New York City because of the amount of shipping that happens here. Some of the most aggressive invasive plants\u2014the bittersweet, for example, the Asiatic bittersweet, started because it was a pretty plant sold at a, a nursery here in New York City."},{"author":"","text":"We see the effects of climate change here on a daily basis. A lot of the plants and animals that we see in New York City would not have been able to survive here about 100 years ago and are responding to a combination of warming temperatures and human-altered\u2014habitat alteration. You know, while here in cities we have a lot of biodiversity that\u2019s not what people, like, implicitly want. Like, a lot of what they\u2019re trying to do is, like, create these vast lawn monocultures. And so in a lot of places the presence of humans will actually reduce biodiversity. It\u2019s our duty and our responsibility that we use our ability to alter habitats to conserve them and make sure we\u2019re living in concert with the world, and, you know, good nature is good for everybody."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, Ryan, thank you so much for chatting with us about your book and for showing us all around your home park.

We come in, we replace it all with concrete. We leave, like, four green spaces [laughs]. Birds still have to migrate through, and so they get concentrated into our parks. So in May, September the parks are just loaded with, you know, these birds that have come all the way up from the equatorial regions, the tropics, migrating to these boreal habitats or the tundra or the northern woods, and they stop here, and so you can see, like, 120 species of bird in a day here in, in May. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just an incredible phenomenon: there\u2019s birds singing and flying around, and they\u2019re all crazy colors.

Just general \u201cbe nice to nature and nature will be nice to you back.\u201d This is more for your own safety, but definitely just follow the rules of the park and obey the law. One thing that I found [laughs] is really nice in New York City is that when you do this enough, you eventually get to know a lot of the folks who work in conservation and for the city and, you know, a lot of the folks who are around, and being friends with them opens up more opportunities to look for nature and wildlife."]},{"begin":"1310.680","end":"1342.120","lines":["There\u2019s a lot of really cool nature groups.

A lot of the plants and animals that we see in New York City would not have been able to survive here about 100 years ago and are responding to a combination of warming temperatures and human-altered\u2014habitat alteration. You know, while here in cities we have a lot of biodiversity that\u2019s not what people, like, implicitly want. Like, a lot of what they\u2019re trying to do is, like, create these vast lawn monocultures. And so in a lot of places the presence of humans will actually reduce biodiversity. It\u2019s our duty and our responsibility that we use our ability to alter habitats to conserve them and make sure we\u2019re living in concert with the world, and, you know, good nature is good for everybody."]},{"begin":"1425.000","end":"1434.160","lines":["Yeah, well, Ryan, thank you so much for chatting with us about your book and for showing us all around your home park.
