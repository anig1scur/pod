He\u2019s one of the experts behind the museum\u2019s new exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, which opened on March 22."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for joining us today."},{"author":"Mason Heberling","text":"Yeah, happy to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What do you think is missing or lacking right now in the way we talk about invasive plants, and why is that important to address?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Yeah, I guess, first and foremost, people, I think [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Is, is largely absent out of the invasive-species conversation. And that is: \u201cHow did species get where they are, and who and what is responsible for that?\u201d That\u2019s a missing key. Oftentimes we talk about invasive plants, invasive insects, invasive\u2014introduced whatever, and we oftentimes focus on specific species or we focus on particular areas that they come from. But we rarely talk about the underlying cause of the introduction, so I think that\u2019s one thing that\u2019s really missing in kind of science communication around the topic."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, and how do you think that the way we talk about and deal with invasive species would be different if, if we address that?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"I mean, I think the hope is and the thought is that there\u2019s not just these nasty organisms that are just out to get humans but that humans are part of nature and humans are part of the problem but also part of the solution, so instead of just ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Pointing at a particular plant and being like, \u201cThis plant is ruining our life,\u201d we instead see it as the broader context of how the plant got here, what we might do to mitigate the problem, but then also what we might do to prevent future problems."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What are some key concepts about invasive species that, that tend to be oversimplified or underemphasized?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Well, there\u2019s a lot [laughs]. I think just in general, in the field of ecology, there\u2019s not necessarily these big laws and rules like maybe other sciences have, like physics or something. And so it\u2014it\u2019s complicated."},{"author":"","text":"So what happens in an ecological web when you remove one species? Sometimes nothing really happens [laughs], and sometimes, if it\u2019s, you know, a keystone species or an important species, the whole web has to be re-networked. It\u2019s not totally random, but there is certainly an element of chance, but also it\u2019s just complicated."},{"author":"","text":"So I think that kind of big question of, \u201cIf you introduce species X to a region where it hasn\u2019t been before,\u201d there\u2019s a lot of factors at play that might help you predict, but ultimately you don\u2019t always necessarily know the impact of a given introduction."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. You\u2019ve done some work on how we might change the messaging around invasive species. Can you give us an example of how poorly considered messages can lead the public to do more harm to the environment than good?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"There are plenty of examples of that. And I guess just to step back, even if you don\u2019t study invasives, you do study invasives, whether indirectly or directly. With that being said, being at the museum, my position as botany curator really has a pretty strong public-facing-outreach component. And being a plant ecologist, also giving a lot of guided hikes, pointing out plants, what plants are what, telling fun stories about particular plants to hook in, and of course, the topic of invasives comes up in that, too."},{"author":"","text":"And so both out in the field, giving these types of tours to the public, and then also in the museum galleries, in the dioramas or other exhibit spaces, it, it kind of came to me that I\u2019m actually not that great at communicating about this particular topic. It\u2019s a very nuanced, complicated topic, a lot of finger-pointing happening."},{"author":"","text":"And I think one big thing that really hit hard for me was: being in Pennsylvania\u2014and in the eastern U.S., period\u2014a lot of our invasives and forests, in particular, our work has found are from East Asia. So going on hikes, pointing out, \u201cHey, this plant is from Japan,\u201d it kind of depends on, you know, what kind of background and philosophies people have, but there\u2019s oftentimes either intentional or unintentional connection with, like, human migration. I really noticed it when COVID-19 started and there was kind of a resurgence of anti-immigration sentiments and, and a resurgence of\u2014or, you know, a fear of East Asia."},{"author":"","text":"A while ago that happened to me, where someone is just like, \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s just, like, Japanese coming to America.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cUgh, I wasn\u2019t looking to have a conversation about human migration.\u201d But then, more thinking about that, you really do see that the way that we address and talk about plant invasions, or invasions in general, really is seeded in this larger context of, you know, if, if you have an issue with this plant because it\u2019s from Japan, what else does that say about us, either ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"As a society and as science?"},{"author":"","text":"So there\u2019s people that are really worried about introduced plants from a biological conservation side. And then there is this kind of other side that especially has been strong and more like the humanities fields where there is this general notion of, \u201cWho are you to say what can live where and when?\u201d And I think that\u2019s a valid question, but also it, it brings up this binary of yes or no, or native or non-native. And I think that can be very off-putting to a lot of people."},{"author":"","text":"From my stance as a botanist we really don\u2019t want the take-home to be like, \u201cWe hate plants.\u201d And from the same sense we don\u2019t want to be\u2014the take-home to be, \u201cWe hate people for particular reasons.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"So I\u2019ve seen it go sour that way. And then I\u2019ve also seen it go sour in this kind of vilifying particular organisms\u2014these fear appeals. They\u2019ve been really popular, and they\u2019ve been really effective in some ways. For instance: \u201cDon\u2019t move this wood because the emerald ash borer or some other introduced insect or something, we don\u2019t wanna move it around.\u201d And that can be pretty effective to, to instill change, but those little sound bites don\u2019t actually give the full nuance of: \u201cHow did we get where we are now? What can we do in the future to prevent that?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And so you oftentimes also see kids, they are chasing after invasive bugs and squashing them. And you could see, as an environmental educator, there being a bit of a conflict there in terms of ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Killing organisms and maybe not necessarily getting that message across of why we are advocating for killing or removing particular organisms in a given context. So it\u2019s really complicated."},{"author":"","text":"And again, working at the museum, exhibit labels need to be short and punchy, and people come to the museum to be inspired, to be instilled with wonder, to be happy. You don\u2019t necessarily come to an exhibit to read an exhibit label that requires you to get out your dictionary and sit there for an hour to read it. So how do you distill these, these big-picture topics to get across both the biological concepts and the sense of action and inspiration for land stewardship?"},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been really working on in the\u2014at the museum here, so we\u2019re really excited that now we are opening this exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, that we really are trying to present this topic in a way that is both informational, inspirational and accurate and gives that full nuance rather than other exhibitions or short science communication pieces that are just kind of like, \u201cThis plant is bad; get rid of it.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. So what got you interested in invasive plants?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"I actually got into plants through invasive plants, helping my parents garden. That\u2019s a good child job, right? \u201cRemove these weeds; we don\u2019t want these weeds here.\u201d And so that always got me thinking, but I didn\u2019t really know much more than that. And then I went to school for biology then, and as an undergraduate I was really interested in nature generically. Then I quickly ended up working a bit in, in horticulture, you know, as a summer job, and again these weeds kind of came back to me: \u201cHow did they get here? What are they doing? How do they interact?\u201d And then from there it kind of spiraled."},{"author":"","text":"My interest, fundamentally, really was the basic science of invasion ecology or introduced plants, seeing it as this big\u2014unintentional\u2014but this big kind of global experiment: What happens when you mix species around with different evolutionary histories? There\u2019s a lot of basic scientific, ecological, evolutionary principles to be tested there that\u2019s really quite fascinating. And that\u2019s what originally drove me and still does drive a lot of my research here at the museum."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I know you\u2019ve done some writing on how naming conventions can change the way we talk about invasive species. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"So this was work that kind of culminated in this exhibition at the museum but also in more behind-the-scenes and public-facing work with different environmental organizations here around Pittsburgh addressing this issue of: \u201cHow do we talk about invasives? What\u2019s the most effective way, and what\u2019s the most accurate way?\u201d Which sometimes aren\u2019t necessarily the same thing."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Something that, that we\u2019re really putting to practice in exhibition labels is common names of plants. Now, unlike other organisms, there\u2019s no official common names for plants. We tend to focus on scientific names, and there\u2019s a big conversation going on now, too, about scientific names and renaming them on various bases. But for common names and for introduced plants in particular, oftentimes we say \u201cJapanese wisteria,\u201d \u201cJapanese knotweed,\u201d \u201cChinese privet.\u201d So we have this kind of geographic descriptor. And at first, honestly, I, I really had no issue with that. I thought, \u201cYeah, that makes sense ...\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"\u201cI\u2019m really interested in where plants are from.\u201d And I thought giving that name provides some context of, yes, this plant is introduced, first off. And then second off, where generally is it from? That\u2019s just interesting."},{"author":"","text":"But what I found in practice with science communication, sometimes, first off, it\u2019s not necessarily accurate. Japanese knotweed may not necessarily be all from Japan, and plants don\u2019t necessarily follow political boundaries. And we also see plants like Canada thistle, for instance, which is a European plant, but we call it Canada thistle, so that\u2019s a different story. So sometimes there\u2019s straight-up misnomers, and sometimes there\u2019s just some blurred lines that isn\u2019t necessarily true; maybe it was just first introduced from there or the first person who encountered it\u2014first European, I should say, or Euro-American\u2014kind of called it that. And that\u2019s not always accurate."},{"author":"","text":"In the case of Japanese knotweed, for instance, which is a huge invasive plant that\u2019s introduced from East Asia and is now in Europe and in North America, and it\u2019s also a huge one in Pittsburgh area here, so it\u2019s one that we\u2019re featuring. And so it was like, \u201cDo we wanna say \u2018Japanese knotweed\u2019?\u201d First off, is that accurate? And then second off, we don\u2019t know where everyone\u2019s coming from when they read the label ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"And we don\u2019t necessarily want Japan to be the first thing they think about and then read ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"A bunch of negative things about this plant. And it seems relatively subtle, but it really is important. So we instead say things like \u201cknotweed,\u201d for instance, or use the name that the Japanese call it, which is itadori. And I think little, subtle shifts like that reframe it a little bit. And, and there are other names, too, that are absolutely offensive to certain ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Groups of people, but there are other things that aren\u2019t necessarily offensive\u2014there\u2019s nothing offensive about \u201cJapanese knotweed,\u201d for instance\u2014but it\u2019s more about the tone and how it\u2019s presented and also the biological accuracy of where exactly is this plant from."},{"author":"","text":"So in a way the good thing about common names is, we can call plants whatever we want [laughs]. We don\u2019t need to necessarily go with scientific conventions when we\u2019re talking in the vernacular. It\u2019s actually really quite cool, too, that different regions of the world may call the same plant different things, and it oftentimes will say [something] about how they use the plant or how it\u2019s engaged in their culture in some way, or it could be descriptive, but it is a powerful and relatively easy way to shift the narrative a little bit about invasives and keep the conversation going rather than just being like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re from this particular place\u2014I know these other plants are from there, too; they must be bad,\u201d and walk away."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah. What would you say are the big things that everyday people and, you know, home-gardening enthusiasts can do to support native plants?"},{"author":"Heberling","text":"It depends where you are in the world, of course, but there\u2019s a big native-plant movement, I would say, this kind of revolution happening in people\u2019s backyards\u2014you know, rethinking gardening in general for not only the plants that they plant but also the other organisms that they can help with their plants."},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s kind of like voting, I would say: you know, every little bit matters. It might not seem like you removing a particular plant and switching it out with another one may be huge, but collectively it really does matter. And also it\u2019s a time for engagement, you know, personal engagement."},{"author":"","text":"One of the things we\u2019re doing here at the museum\u2014connecting with local resources, because there\u2019s a lot of native-plant nurseries in a lot of places across the world. And going to a big-box store or even a, a big commercial nursery, don\u2019t assume that all the plants there are, are great for you to plant. And so you have a little bit of responsibility but also agency to make those decisions. And I think in the last couple of years for Pennsylvania but also in the last, really, couple of decades for a lot of different U.S. states, there\u2019s been a lot of increased regulation of the commercial trade. And some of that I see as being really positive because some of that is out of the hands of the consumer; it affects consumer decisions\u2014what\u2019s available to buy, for instance."},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s not only about necessarily removing plants but then also cultivating an environment that is conducive to the type of healthy ecosystems that we want. It really needs to be an active restoration, and active restoration also doesn\u2019t mean that it necessarily has to be super difficult ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"There are a lot of native weeds. So I\u2019m using the term \u201cweed\u201d here, and a weed is just a plant out of place; it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s native or non-native. And sometimes we hear the word \u201cweed\u201d and we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s bad.\u201d But what I mean by that is we can foster self-sustaining gardens, too, and that\u2019s a really exciting, empowering thing."},{"author":"","text":"For instance, plants like milkweed, we consider that a weed, and maybe it once was really reviled for various reasons\u2014oftentimes weeds are these early species that do well in these kind of early successional or in these disturbed environments, which is true in cities and a lot of other places. But what\u2019s beautiful is they can self-seed and they can be a keystone species in these ecological networks and really take it from there."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been a great conversation."},{"author":"Heberling","text":"Yeah, you\u2019re welcome."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

Now, unlike other organisms, there\u2019s no official common names for plants. We tend to focus on scientific names, and there\u2019s a big conversation going on now, too, about scientific names and renaming them on various bases. But for common names and for introduced plants in particular, oftentimes we say \u201cJapanese wisteria,\u201d \u201cJapanese knotweed,\u201d \u201cChinese privet.\u201d So we have this kind of geographic descriptor. And at first, honestly, I, I really had no issue with that.

Japanese knotweed may not necessarily be all from Japan, and plants don\u2019t necessarily follow political boundaries. And we also see plants like Canada thistle, for instance, which is a European plant, but we call it Canada thistle, so that\u2019s a different story. So sometimes there\u2019s straight-up misnomers, and sometimes there\u2019s just some blurred lines that isn\u2019t necessarily true; maybe it was just first introduced from there or the first person who encountered it\u2014first European, I should say, or Euro-American\u2014kind of called it that.

And so it was like, \u201cDo we wanna say \u2018Japanese knotweed\u2019?\u201d First off, is that accurate?

We don\u2019t need to necessarily go with scientific conventions when we\u2019re talking in the vernacular.

And going to a big-box store or even a, a big commercial nursery, don\u2019t assume that all the plants there are, are great for you to plant. And so you have a little bit of responsibility but also agency to make those decisions. And I think in the last couple of years for Pennsylvania but also in the last, really, couple of decades for a lot of different U.S. states, there\u2019s been a lot of increased regulation of the commercial trade. And some of that I see as being really positive because some of that is out of the hands of the consumer; it affects consumer decisions\u2014what\u2019s available to buy, for instance."]},{"begin":"869.200","end":"884.800","lines":["So it\u2019s not only about necessarily removing plants but then also cultivating an environment that is conducive to the type of healthy ecosystems that we want.
