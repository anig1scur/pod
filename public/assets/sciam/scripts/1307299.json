      "text": ": Last year Massachusetts passed new regulations forcing Cape Cod communities to clean up wastewater pollution, much of which is coming from people\u2019s homes. As a result, towns on the cape are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to install sewers and upgrade septic systems. But what if there was a cheaper solution? Some say there is: it\u2019s called urine diversion, or \u201cpee-cycling.\u201d For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to the final episode of our three-part Fascination series on Cape Cod\u2019s water pollution. We\u2019re calling this episode \u201cLiquid Gold.\u201d This week, WBUR\u2019s Barbara Moran is taking us to Falmouth, Massachusetts. [CLIP: Gravel crunches underfoot]"

    {
      "author": "Moran",
      "text": ": What most humans on Cape Cod do is use septic tanks. So all those nutrients leach into local bays and ponds, where they feed algae and invasive plants. The algae and plants grow out of control, sucking up oxygen in the water, killing fish and turning the bottom to muck. To solve that problem Falmouth had a plan."

    },

      "author": "Moran",
      "text": ": And there are other pros to pee-cycling. It\u2019s relatively cheap compared with sewers or advanced septic: it costs about $6,000 to install a fancy system like the one Earle and Hilda have. And if you don\u2019t want to sprinkle your tinkle on your flower beds, getting your urine hauled away is pretty cheap. Or for less than $100 you can get a portable urinal called a Cubie. And people could start pee-cycling quickly, without having to wait decades for sewers."

But still, folks are interested. Earle and Hilda host regular open houses to teach people about pee-cycling. One day last fall more than a dozen people showed up."
