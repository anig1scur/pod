      "text": ": Some sounds are spooky [ghostly yowl?]. Some are unpleasant [screechy blackboard? Vinyl album scratch?]. And some are entirely unsettling. [creaking door? Scream? Discordant psycho-shower-scene type music?]. But some sounds\u2026some sounds\u2026are like nothing you\u2019ve ever heard before\u2026and nothing you\u2019d ever want to hear again. [Sound of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde] THAT was the sound of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. And if you\u2019re thinking, hold on, molecules don\u2019t make noise\u2026well, you\u2019re right. But that discordant nightmare was an audible soundscape that represents the chemical properties of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. What\u2019s even more eerie, is that while that sound may have made you want to crawl out of your skin and skitter towards the door, the chemical itself has a similar effect on ants. That\u2019s according to a study in the journal Patterns."

And he said this as a kind of joke but he was totally true in saying this because insects are producing rich amounts of different chemicals for different purposes."

      "text": ": Like an overpowering perfume, these volatile secretions waft through the air and irritate critters who might be thinking of noshing on the bugs that produced them. Boev\u00e9, in particular, studies the larvae of sawfly species, which produce different cocktails of chemicals that act as a repellant, especially against ants. But Boev\u00e9 is not only an entomologist. He\u2019s also an amateur musician. And he got to thinking, well, smells transmit a signal by drifting through the air\u2026and so do sounds."

      "author": "Boev\u00e9",
      "text": ": I thought that it would be quite interesting to go deeper into this parallel between the perception via two different sensory systems namely smelling and hearing. So the idea was to convert these volatiles into sounds. Then\u2026to compare, on the one hand, predators reacting against the volatiles with, on the other hand, humans hearing sounds that represent these volatiles."

      "text": ": The insect irritants were much more interesting\u2026because each species produces its own signature chemical blend. Boev\u00e9 and Giot mimicked those molecular mixtures by taking the individual chemical sounds and mixing them together on a sound board\u2026using different volumes to represent the concentrations of compounds in each species\u2019 toxic concoction.

Boev\u00e9 exposed ants to the actual chemicals\u2026either individually or in mixtures\u2026and recorded how thoroughly the predators were repulsed by each. And for the sonified sounds\u2026volunteers would play clips\u2026of single molecules or mixtures\u2026and listen to the sounds from a pair of loudspeakers."

The correlation between a chemical\u2019s effect on ants\u2026and a sound\u2019s effect on people\u2026means that he can use sonification to study the defensive scents of new species\u2026or species for which it might be hard to scare up a specimen."
