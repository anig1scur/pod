I\u2019m Karen Hopkin. You\u2019re probably familiar with the concept of evolution. Living things evolve by accumulating genetic changes, which are then weeded out or preserved through a process of natural selection. Turns out\u00a0the same thing happens in music. And by using the same software that\u2019s used to track mutations in genes, researchers have mapped out the sorts of changes that shape the evolution of songs. The findings appear in the journal Current Biology. [Patrick E. Savage et. al,\u00a0Sequence alignment of folk song melodies reveals cross-cultural regularities of musical evolution]"},{"author":"Patrick Savage","text":"I\u2019ve always loved music\u00a0since I was a child."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Patrick Savage, an ethnomusicologist at Keio University in Fujisawa, Japan."},{"author":"Savage","text":"I grew up singing English folk songs.\u00a0My dad really likes folk music and often has his friends come over and do jam sessions at home. Then, when I moved to Japan about 11 years ago, I started studying Japanese folk songs. And I really liked that repertoire, too."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"The style was very different from the music he grew up with."},{"author":"Savage","text":"So, like [sings tonal sounds]."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Yet the way the songs are learned, by trying to imitate a recording or a teacher, is pretty much the same."},{"author":"Savage","text":"So it made sense to test these ideas about \u201cAre these general evolutionary rules that we find in music, especially in these folk songs, repertoires I know, that would kind of parallel what we find in genetics and allow us to get a more sort of general unifying theory about music and evolution across different cultures?\u201d"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"At first, he and his colleagues hoped to tackle a huge reconstruction of the family tree of all folk music."},{"author":"Savage","text":"But kind of quickly, [we] realized that it was very\u2014it would be quite challenging to do because when you build these phylogenies, these family trees, you kind of have to make a lot of assumptions about how the process works."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So, for example, geneticists know what kinds of mutations crop up in DNA\u2014and with what frequency\u2014information they can then use to assemble and calibrate their gene-based phylogenetic trees. But Savage says they didn\u2019t have the same level of knowledge for music."},{"author":"Savage","text":"So we decided that, rather than try to do the big reconstructions, we would first focus on the simplest case, which is the pairs."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Savage and his team combed through enormous catalogs of English and Japanese folk songs to identify pairs of melodies that were clearly related\u2014like\u00a0two different versions of the song \u201cScarborough Fair,\u201d which is actually based on a traditional English ballad about an elfin knight. [CLIP: Woman sings\u00a0\u201cScarborough Fair\u201d]"},{"author":"Savage","text":"With the English ones, people had been going out there and notating things by ear since at least the early 1900s."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"And by\u00a0the mid-1900s, a similar process had begun in Japan."},{"author":"Savage","text":"They just kind of sent teams of scholars out throughout all of Japan and said, \u201cWe need to collect all the folk songs before they disappear.\u201d"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So Savage had a pool of some 10,000 tunes to work with."},{"author":"Savage","text":"I just had to go through and just and look at the notations in the anthologies and kind of sing them to myself as I converted them into these sequences of text\u2014Cs and Ds\u00a0and Gs and things like that\u2014so we could run the sequence alignment algorithms on them."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So\u00a0what did team Savage learn? Well, a few things."},{"author":"Savage","text":"One was that more functional notes, notes that had stronger rhythm functions, would be more stable."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"So\u00a0notes that are key to the melody."},{"author":"Savage","text":"You listen to \u201cScarborough Fair,\u201d the end, you know, \u201cShe once was a true love of mine.\u201d The final note is a very strong downbeat. And it\u2019s also the last note where you\u2019re kind of always expecting a note. So very rarely would you end on like \u201cShe once was a true love of mine.\u201d It feels very unfinished. Likewise, you would never expect that note to just be deleted. You wouldn\u2019t expect \u201cShe once was a true love of....\u201d That would just be very strange."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Next, they found that when one note mutates to another note, the changes tend to be small."},{"author":"Savage","text":"So like one or two semitones above or below where it would have been rather than six or seven semitones. Which would be a difference of like, [sings] \u201cla la\u201d versus like [sings] \u201cla la.\u201d"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Here, for example, Savage sings snippets of a Japanese lullaby."},{"author":"Savage","text":"These ones have different lyrics but almost the same melody. The first one was notated from the singing of Tonsui Kikuchi. And it sounds something like this\u00a0[sings]. And the second one, notated from the singing of Shigeri Kitsu, sounds like this\u00a0[sings]. So the differences there, for example, the last one\u00a0[sings] versus [sings] are very small, just a semitone difference,\u00a0but [they are] an example of a small substitution distance."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Such small substitutions have minimal effect on the overall melody. So they\u2019re the essentially the musical equivalent of what geneticists call a \u201cneutral mutation,\u201d one that doesn\u2019t alter an organism\u2019s fitness. Now, all that seems pretty straightforward. But the next finding was a bit of a surprise."},{"author":"Savage","text":"There\u2019s two different kinds of mutations you can have in genetics or music. The substitutions are one-note changes to another note. Or you can have an insertion or deletion where a note is either inserted or deleted from the sequence\u00a0or a nucleotide is inserted or deleted from the sequence. In genetics, these are very rare."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That\u2019s because the instructions carried by genes are read in sets of three nucleotides. Add or remove just one, and you throw off the whole register, which messes up the rest of the message."},{"author":"Savage","text":"But we found, in music, insertions/deletions were actually quite a bit more common than the substitutions."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"That\u2019s because they can easily be accommodated by holding other notes longer or singing some faster, leaving the melody intact. So in one version of \u201cScarborough Fair\u201d ..."},{"author":"Savage:'","text":"So Martin Carthy kinda sings, \u201cParsley sa-a-age, rosemary\u00a0and thyme.\u201d And Simon and Garfunkel just sing \u201cparsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.\u201d So, this little \u201csa-a-age\u201d ornament is just deleted. But they just sing the \u201csage\u201d a little bit longer, and it takes up the same amount of rhythmic space."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Savage says that many of these mutations, like their genetic counterparts, are probably accidental."},{"author":"Savage","text":"That\u2019s what I do when I learn songs. I\u2019ll be learning from my singer, and then I\u2019ll record myself singing, and I\u2019ll realize that I\u2019ve sung a couple of notes a little bit different\u2014a\u00a0little bit higher here, a little bit lower there.\u00a0Or I added an extra note by accident. I\u2019m usually not consciously trying to change what my teacher has sung. But it\u2019s just easy to crop up."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Using a genetic approach to analyze melodies also has some practical applications."},{"author":"Savage","text":"We can apply these sequence alignment techniques to quantify how similar two songs are and how likely the changes are to happen and sort of have little bit more quantitative evidence for these high-profile multimillion-dollar [copyright] cases like \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d or George Harrison\u2019s case with the Chiffons and \u201cMy Sweet Lord\u201d/\u201cHe\u2019s So Fine.\u201d"},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"At the same time, Savage looks forward to continuing to explore music\u2019s ancestral roots\u00a0as a scientist and as a musician."},{"author":"Savage","text":"Everyone\u2019s always inspired by the great musicians of the past. But, like, these currents of evolution go back hundreds of thousands of years. So, yeah, it\u2019s kind of this sort of connection with other humans through music at a very deep level and throughout time is one that kind of excites me as a performer."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"And it makes his science sing.
