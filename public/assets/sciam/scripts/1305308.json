    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Okay, here are some major examples of effects: Instead of usual rising air and rainy conditions in southeast Asia, that area sees subsiding air, which means dry weather and can cause drought. In 2016 there was a major drought in Indonesia that caused food shortages and helped fuel huge wildfires. Meanwhile other places, such as part of eastern Africa and parts of South America, often see higher rainfall, which can cause major flooding. Changes in looping air patterns also alter things like the jet stream across the U.S. and tends to bring cooler weather to the south and warmer to the north. Also, because it\u2019s not all bad news, we do tend to see less hurricane activity in the Atlantic. That\u2019s because the atmosphere is more stable\u2014hurricanes need unstable air to get going. (But this year there are also super warm ocean waters\u2014that\u2019s like hurricane fuel\u2014and it\u2019s hard to know which influence will win out. So TBD on that one.)"

    {
      "author": "Thompson",
      "text": ": Well, very tricky to forecast, but right now, there are slightly better-than-even odds that this event will develop into a strong one. It should build in strength in the coming months. And El Ni\u00f1os typically peak in the Northern Hemisphere winter. And strength is important because we have more confidence will see certain effects when it\u2019s stronger. Though nothing is a guarantee\u2014a strong event in 2016 didn\u2019t bring needed rains to SoCal as the one in 1998 did."

    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Unfortunately, an El Ni\u00f1o would add to the heat for sure. They always bump up the global average temperature and can frequently set yearly heat records. 2016 is still the hottest year on record, thanks, in part, to the major El Ni\u00f1o that year. But really it\u2019s adding on to the background global warming signal\u20142016 was half a degree C warmer than 1998 (at the time, 1998 was far and away the hottest year). Given El Ni\u00f1o and a good chance it will be strong, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see a global heat record this year or next."
