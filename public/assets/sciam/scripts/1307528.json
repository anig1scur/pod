This is Rachel Feltman for Science Quickly, but you\u2019re actually not listening to our weekly news roundup. See, crafting a news roundup that\u2019s hot and fresh and ready to go first thing on Monday morning takes a lot of hustle on Thursday and Friday. We figured you\u2019d understand why we\u2019d rather avoid that over the holiday. But we didn\u2019t want to leave you hanging too long without a new episode of Science Quickly to enjoy, so I went and dug up a wild blast from the past for us to share instead. In June of 1924, which yeah was a 100 years ago, wow, Scientific American was publishing articles that are\u2014kind of depressingly relevant today, actually. One piece reported on a conference at Yale meant to tackle the rising issue of traffic jams and automobile accidents. Another lamented the endless supply of food waste and other garbage coming out of 20th-century\u00a0 cities, and yet another reported on our efforts to eradicate bedbugs. Isn\u2019t it great to know that we\u2019ve just solved all those problems! And definitely haven\u2019t just made them worse. But there\u2019s a big beautiful data illustration near the front of the issue that really caught my attention. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Family Tree of Coal Tar.\u201d The roots of this stately tree are shown to be planted firmly in black coal, and its branches split into a dizzying array of byproducts\u2014which are then used to make an equally dizzying array of consumer goods. In 1924 Scientific American writers gushed over all the ways that coal tar derivatives might show up in your home. Here is a quote from the caption below the illustration: \u201cDelicate perfumes, beautiful dyes, drugs, fire-extinguishing solutions, motor fuels, powerful explosives, fertilizers\u2014these are but a few of the many diversified products based on coal tar.\u201d These days, as more folks become aware of the environmental dangers that fossil fuels pose, not to mention their health risks. Their inclusion in everyday products gets a lot less publicity. For instance, you might not be aware that most of the fabric fibers used in clothing today are petroleum-based or that about 99 percent of all plastics are derived from fossil fuels. Petrochemicals, which are chemicals made from fossil fuels, show up in many thousands of different consumer products, including everything from crayons to cosmetics. Because of that, petrochemical production is actually climbing even as we work to cut down on fossil fuel use to power our vehicles and homes. And that\u2019s\u2014probably on purpose. Here\u2019s a line straight from the website of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association that sounds a little too close to our friends from 1924 for comfort: \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget those diapers, pacifiers, and toys used by parents and babies around the world that are all made with oil or natural gas or both.\u201d That\u2019s not just bad for the planet either. Research shows that these chemicals can affect neurodevelopment, impact fertility, increase the risk of cancer and contribute to metabolic diseases. And at this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to avoid them. As the National Cancer Institute reported in 2010, \u201cto a disturbing extent, babies are born \u2018pre-polluted.\u2019\u201d You might think, wow, this is obviously a problem worth tackling, so why aren't we tackling it? but there are a lot of people quite literally invested in our continued use of petrochemicals. Basically fossil fuel companies know they\u2019re losing the battle, albeit more slowly than they should be, when it comes to combustion engines and coal-powered electricity and all that jazz. Some of them are counting on plastics and other byproducts to make up the difference. The management consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in May that the petrochemical industry had a \u201cbasis for cautious optimism\u201d in terms of demand in the near future. Feeling ready to punch a hole in the wall? Same, but let\u2019s be real, there are probably a bunch of petrochemicals in there, too. So let\u2019s harness that incandescent rage as fuel in the fight against single-use plastics and other petrochemical end products. For starters, if you want to avoid putting fossil fuels on your face and in your body, keep an eye out for ingredients like mineral oil, petroleum jelly, paraffin wax, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and isopropyl alcohol. Of course, our individual choices won\u2019t be enough to kick petrochemicals to the curb\u2014or even keep them out of our everyday lives, because there are loads of them and they show up in everything. But it\u2019s a start! And maybe your impassioned rant about the pervasiveness of petrochemicals will be the one that inspires the right person to kick-start a revolution or something. Listen, we gotta do what we can. I don\u2019t want to leave you on that infuriating note, so here\u2019s an extra treat from that 1924 issue of Scientific American: apparently back then we had something called a \u201cPsychic Investigation Committee.\u201d And you\u2019ll never guess what they investigated! In June of 1924 Scientific American published the results of an experiment on the intersection of telepathy and radio, which was conducted by magazine staff in consultation with the committee. Basically a guy from Scientific American got on the radio and asked people to guess what he was thinking about in a series of categories like numbers and the names of department stores. I have to say, the author of the study is at least pretty up-front about the fact that the results don\u2019t prove any telepathic ability\u2014the folks who got one answer right weren\u2019t any more likely to get a second question right than the average respondent. But he still ended optimistically: \u201c\u2018There are enough who got complete or partial successes on three separate items to make the hunt through the list for real telepathists quite worth while.\u201d So here is the real question, can you guess what number I\u2019m thinking of right now? Just kidding! But you should send us your guess anyway because we\u2019d love to hear from you. Just make sure you throw in some feedback or suggestions for topics you\u2019d like us to cover while you\u2019re at it. You can send us those messages telepathically if you want to try, but I\u2019d recommend emailing them to ScienceQuickly@sciam.com, too, just to be on the safe side.I will say that I\u2019m seeing some pretty awesome stuff in the future of your podcast feed.\u00a0 Tune in on Wednesday to learn about the wild horses currently taking TikTok by storm. And don\u2019t forget to join us on Friday for the fourth and final installment in our miniseries on field research in Antarctica. Plus, our beloved news roundup will be back and better than ever next Monday. Just one more quick request before I let you go, would you mind rating and reviewing the show wherever you\u2019re listening to it. Whatever your favorite pod catcher app or platform is. We would so appreciate a five star rating, a comment, give us a little boost. And if you don\u2019t quite feel like we are earning those five stars yet, shoot me an email at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. And let me know what you would like to see change.\u00a0 Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio. Elah Feder, Alexa Lim, Madison Goldberg and Anaissa Ruiz Tejada edit our show, with fact-checking from Shayna Posses and Aaron Shattuck. Our theme music was composed by Dominic Smith.

Monday, listeners! This is Rachel Feltman for Science Quickly, but you\u2019re actually not listening to our weekly news roundup. See, crafting a news roundup that\u2019s hot and fresh and ready to go first thing on Monday morning takes a lot of hustle on Thursday and Friday. We figured you\u2019d understand why we\u2019d rather avoid that over the holiday. But we didn\u2019t want to leave you hanging too long without a new episode of Science Quickly to enjoy, so I went and dug up a wild blast from the past for us to share instead. In June of 1924, which yeah was a 100 years ago, wow, Scientific American was publishing articles that are\u2014kind of depressingly relevant today, actually. One piece reported on a conference at Yale meant to tackle the rising issue of traffic jams and automobile accidents. Another lamented the endless supply of food waste and other garbage coming out of 20th-century\u00a0 cities, and yet another reported on our efforts to eradicate bedbugs. Isn\u2019t it great to know that we\u2019ve just solved all those problems! And definitely haven\u2019t just made them worse. But there\u2019s a big beautiful data illustration near the front of the issue that really caught my attention. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Family Tree of Coal Tar.\u201d The roots of this stately tree are shown to be planted firmly in black coal, and its branches split into a dizzying array of byproducts\u2014which are then used to make an equally dizzying array of consumer goods. In 1924 Scientific American writers gushed over all the ways that coal tar derivatives might show up in your home. Here is a quote from the caption below the illustration: \u201cDelicate perfumes, beautiful dyes, drugs, fire-extinguishing solutions, motor fuels, powerful explosives, fertilizers\u2014these are but a few of the many diversified products based on coal tar.\u201d These days, as more folks become aware of the environmental dangers that fossil fuels pose, not to mention their health risks. Their inclusion in everyday products gets a lot less publicity. For instance, you might not be aware that most of the fabric fibers used in clothing today are petroleum-based or that about 99 percent of all plastics are derived from fossil fuels. Petrochemicals, which are chemicals made from fossil fuels, show up in many thousands of different consumer products, including everything from crayons to cosmetics. Because of that, petrochemical production is actually climbing even as we work to cut down on fossil fuel use to power our vehicles and homes. And that\u2019s\u2014probably on purpose. Here\u2019s a line straight from the website of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association that sounds a little too close to our friends from 1924 for comfort: \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget those diapers, pacifiers, and toys used by parents and babies around the world that are all made with oil or natural gas or both.\u201d That\u2019s not just bad for the planet either. Research shows that these chemicals can affect neurodevelopment, impact fertility, increase the risk of cancer and contribute to metabolic diseases. And at this point, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to avoid them. As the National Cancer Institute reported in 2010, \u201cto a disturbing extent, babies are born \u2018pre-polluted.\u2019\u201d You might think, wow, this is obviously a problem worth tackling, so why aren't we tackling it? but there are a lot of people quite literally invested in our continued use of petrochemicals. Basically fossil fuel companies know they\u2019re losing the battle, albeit more slowly than they should be, when it comes to combustion engines and coal-powered electricity and all that jazz. Some of them are counting on plastics and other byproducts to make up the difference. The management consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in May that the petrochemical industry had a \u201cbasis for cautious optimism\u201d in terms of demand in the near future. Feeling ready to punch a hole in the wall? Same, but let\u2019s be real, there are probably a bunch of petrochemicals in there, too. So let\u2019s harness that incandescent rage as fuel in the fight against single-use plastics and other petrochemical end products. For starters, if you want to avoid putting fossil fuels on your face and in your body, keep an eye out for ingredients like mineral oil, petroleum jelly, paraffin wax, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and isopropyl alcohol. Of course, our individual choices won\u2019t be enough to kick petrochemicals to the curb\u2014or even keep them out of our everyday lives, because there are loads of them and they show up in everything. But it\u2019s a start! And maybe your impassioned rant about the pervasiveness of petrochemicals will be the one that inspires the right person to kick-start a revolution or something. Listen, we gotta do what we can. I don\u2019t want to leave you on that infuriating note, so here\u2019s an extra treat from that 1924 issue of Scientific American: apparently back then we had something called a \u201cPsychic Investigation Committee.\u201d And you\u2019ll never guess what they investigated! In June of 1924 Scientific American published the results of an experiment on the intersection of telepathy and radio, which was conducted by magazine staff in consultation with the committee. Basically a guy from Scientific American got on the radio and asked people to guess what he was thinking about in a series of categories like numbers and the names of department stores. I have to say, the author of the study is at least pretty up-front about the fact that the results don\u2019t prove any telepathic ability\u2014the folks who got one answer right weren\u2019t any more likely to get a second question right than the average respondent. But he still ended optimistically: \u201c\u2018There are enough who got complete or partial successes on three separate items to make the hunt through the list for real telepathists quite worth while.\u201d So here is the real question, can you guess what number I\u2019m thinking of right now? Just kidding! But you should send us your guess anyway because we\u2019d love to hear from you. Just make sure you throw in some feedback or suggestions for topics you\u2019d like us to cover while you\u2019re at it. You can send us those messages telepathically if you want to try, but I\u2019d recommend emailing them to ScienceQuickly@sciam.com, too, just to be on the safe side.I will say that I\u2019m seeing some pretty awesome stuff in the future of your podcast feed.\u00a0 Tune in on Wednesday to learn about the wild horses currently taking TikTok by storm. And don\u2019t forget to join us on Friday for the fourth and final installment in our miniseries on field research in Antarctica. Plus, our beloved news roundup will be back and better than ever next Monday. Just one more quick request before I let you go, would you mind rating and reviewing the show wherever you\u2019re listening to it. Whatever your favorite pod catcher app or platform is. We would so appreciate a five star rating, a comment, give us a little boost. And if you don\u2019t quite feel like we are earning those five stars yet, shoot me an email at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. And let me know what you would like to see change.\u00a0 Science Quickly is produced by me, Rachel Feltman, along with Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio. Elah Feder, Alexa Lim, Madison Goldberg and Anaissa Ruiz Tejada edit our show, with fact-checking from Shayna Posses and Aaron Shattuck. Our theme music was composed by Dominic Smith.
