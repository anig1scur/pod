Her reply was: \u201cHe\u2019s amazing\u2014and he smells amazing.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"Look, I get it. How someone smells, whether it\u2019s good or bad, can leave a long-lasting impression. That\u2019s why we pour so much money into scented bath washes, deodorants and perfumes."},{"author":"","text":"But under all of those products remains our natural scent. And while factors such as illness and how often we bathe can affect that smell, so can food, according to a number of studies."},{"author":"","text":"Freelance science journalist Sofia Quaglia has covered this research, and we spoke to her about the surprising ways what we eat can affect how we smell. Here\u2019s that conversation."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for joining us today. So is it, like, if I eat a lot of jelly beans, I\u2019ll start smelling sweet? [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Sofia Quaglia","text":"[Laughs.] I don\u2019t think\u2014no, it\u2019s not that clear-cut. So obviously, caveat here is that this is a very new field, and so we\u2019re only starting to collect data. We don\u2019t have that much data that we can really draw really, really good lines about, like, \u201cSmelling sweet is because you\u2019ve eaten sweet stuff,\u201d or \u201cSmelling sour is because you\u2019ve eaten sour stuff.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And in general it\u2019s not really that straightforward of a process, right, \u2019cause the food goes through our body and gets digested inside our gut. And then either we\u2019re smelling because our breath smells a certain way because of the volatile chemicals coming back up from our gut, or because they\u2019ve gone through our bloodstream and we\u2019re sweating them out, right? So the sugars and the foods and the delicious jelly beans go through a lot of processes before they affect how we smell. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"One of the things that I found surprising in your article was the work that researchers did on the way garlic makes bodies smell. Can you talk about that work?"},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"Yeah, I love that. So obviously, we all love to eat garlic; it makes things super tasty. But then our breath doesn\u2019t smell exactly as delicious afterwards. [Laughs.] I know a lot of people wouldn\u2019t fancy a kiss with garlic-smelling breath. And so researchers\u2014it\u2019s one of the reasons researchers targeted it, right? They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s the most annoying of the smells when you\u2019re, when you\u2019re smelling it on somebody\u2019s breath. Let\u2019s see what happens to body odor after garlic,\u201d right?"},{"author":"","text":"And so the researchers actually had about 40 men wear some armpit pads\u2014like, yeah, like, absorbent pads under their armpits\u2014collecting their sweat for about 12 hours. And then they made some of them eat a little bit of garlic, some of them eat loads of garlic, and some of them take some, like, garlic supplements."},{"author":"","text":"Then they had [about] 80 women rate the scent from those pads, which is kind of gross if you think about it too much. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, how do you sign up for that study? [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"I have not. I did not sign up for this."},{"author":"","text":"And then the women basically had to rate the men\u2019s smell, right, according to, like, subjective ratings that\u2014of how they felt, whether they were pleasant and attractive or masculine and intense. So they filled out a survey."},{"author":"","text":"And the findings suggested that the men with a little bit of garlic consumption weren\u2019t making these women react in any particular way, but those eating a lot of garlic were perceived as very sexy, so their rankings for sexiness went up. So the smell of garlic under the armpit was smelling good [Laughs], was smelling delicious, was smelling sexy."},{"author":"","text":"The researchers themselves, I spoke to them when\u2014after they conducted the study. They were quite confused, too. They were like, \u201cWe had to do this three times \u2019cause we didn\u2019t think the data made sense,\u201d right? You would expect garlic to smell nasty under an armpit as well. So they were also confused and surprised, and they thought it was quite funny to have this data."},{"author":"","text":"And they\u2019ve actually thought long and hard about it, and their theory right now is that, you know, maybe\u2014because garlic is, is a good food for your health, right? It\u2019s a healthy food. It has a lot of antioxidants. It has a lot of antimicrobial properties that improve people\u2019s health. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s making someone smell subconsciously more sexy. It\u2019s because, you know, we\u2019ve evolved to select romantic partners or sexual partners that are healthy because of the way that evolution works and how our bodies are wired to think about, like, \u201cOh, we need to procreate.\u201d So maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s going on? This evolutionary lens is how the scientists have been trying to explain it."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"So the solution is: eat a garlic-heavy diet, but really make sure to brush your teeth."},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"Exactly. Brush your teeth, and then just go around with your armpits kind of just, like ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"Musty. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"You can\u2019t see Sofia [Laughs], but she\u2019s lifting up her arms to, to illustrate her armpits to us."},{"author":"","text":"But the garlic research did sort of fall in line with the broader research that suggested eating a lot of fruits and veggies tends to make us smell better, at least from a sweat perspective. It can be, depending on how gassy you are as a human, it could be hit or miss with your GI track and your breath. But when it comes to sweat in particular it does seem that, like, lots of fruit, lots of veg are pretty good for us."},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"Yeah, so while maybe our pee smells a little weird after we have asparagus or we can get a little gassy after some, some veggies, similar studies where they had kind of people wear sweat pads and stuff\u2014I think this one was done in Australia\u2014found that the men who were eating more fruits and vegetables were kind of smelling better. They were smelling more fruity, more floral, more sweet, and kind of more widely, yeah, the fruits and veg were making them more attractive to women who were smelling their scent."},{"author":"","text":"And again, researchers kind of justify that by saying, \u201cOkay, well, it\u2019s probably because, you know, veggies, fruits, they\u2019re healthy for our diet, they make our bodies healthy and strong, and so that\u2019s maybe what our body scent is then subconsciously communicating.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"But again, these are really small studies with small samples, so we don\u2019t have, like, loads of data. But all in all, it seems to be that there\u2019s a trend or a pattern here."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Are there foods that\u2014or things that we consume that may make us less appealing, like, smell less great?"},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"Although there isn\u2019t a lot of data and we\u2019re just starting to see emerging trends, researchers have started to see a little bit of patterns on stuff that are making us smell a little bit less pleasant. So for instance, [some of] that same team that put the absorbent pads for garlic [Laughs], they also looked into whether meat makes us more attractive."},{"author":"","text":"They had men who were either eating a lot of meat or a nonmeat diet for two weeks, and then they had, again, women rate their scents for pleasantness, attractiveness, masculinity and intensity. And the odor of the men who weren\u2019t eating the meat was, on average, rated more attractive, more pleasant and less intense."},{"author":"","text":"And again, the researchers kind of had to rack their brains about this \u2019cause they were like, \u201cOh, but what\u2014I mean, we, evolutionarily, we\u2019ve always eaten meat. Why would that make us smell less pleasant?\u201d This was not what they were expecting to find because meat is considered kind of, like, an important part of the human diet."},{"author":"","text":"But the researchers also did know, you know, early humans were eating meat, sure, but they were eating, like, a lot less meat than what we\u2019re eating today, and they weren\u2019t eating the super ultraprocessed meat that we eat now. They were eating different types of meat. They were eating game. So maybe that\u2019s kind of the effect that we\u2019re seeing there."},{"author":"","text":"And another one is alcohol. Although alcohol might make us feel relaxed and in a better mood, it does seem to be one of those that doesn\u2019t smell that good."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"I feel like, with alcohol in particular, we kind of know that intuitively. If anyone, you know, went to college and drank a lot [Laughs], there\u2019s a smell that happens after you\u2019ve had a, a hard night of drinking that is not great. But the meat was a little bit surprising, especially now, in an era where there are so many people pushing, like, meat-only diets. It does feel like [Laughs], in addition to the health effects that can come from subsisting off of just meat, it also might make you less attractive to people you might want to be attractive to."},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"[Laughs.] Yeah, again, this is very early, early days data ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Right."},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"These are very small studies, so I don\u2019t know if we can really make huge, sweeping statements, but for sure there seems to be a little bit of a subtle shift, so depending on how much you care about how you smell [Laughs], that could be something to take into consideration."},{"author":"","text":"I think an important caveat to point out here is so much of this is also culturally mediated. Things that somebody growing up in a certain type of culture might not find attractive in scent, somebody from another culture might. So we need to take into consideration all of that and kind of see that there\u2019s obviously, like, subjective preferences; there\u2019s cultural preferences. If you\u2019ve grown up eating rice and curry your whole life, you\u2019re obviously going to have a different predisposition towards that scent, compared to somebody who\u2019s never eaten rice and curry before, right?"},{"author":"","text":"So there\u2019s a lot of cultural mediation here that we need to think about, and there\u2019s a lot of context. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been quite hard to set up these experiments, right, aside from the icky parts of, like, how do we collect men\u2019s sweat under their armpits? [Laughs.] So I think this is a super fascinating area of study, for sure."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"But we also kind of know that scent is important intuitively. Like, everyone talks about, like, how a newborn baby smells or, you know, wearing your partner\u2019s old hoodie because it still smells like them when they\u2019re away from you. So we kind of know, like, yes, it\u2019s culturally mediated, but there does seem to be a there there in the sense of, like, the way a person smells can really factor into whether you\u2019re attracted to them or you\u2019re repelled by them."},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"For sure, and what\u2019s super fascinating here is that each one of us has a unique scent profile, right, like a fingerprint. There\u2019s a growing body of research here that shows that everything from our personality type, like, whether you\u2019re an extrovert or whether you\u2019re an introvert, to our mood and our health really affects the way we smell, you know?"},{"author":"","text":"It comes from genes. It comes from hormones. It comes from health, from hygiene. It comes from whether you\u2019re a male or a female, whether you\u2019re young or old, gay or straight, dominant or subordinate, ovulating, pregnant, sick, happy, sad. So, like, all of these things affect our odor and our scent and the way our, our body smells."},{"author":"","text":"So diet is just, like, one of the small bits and pieces that goes on top of that, right? That\u2019s also why it\u2019s hard to say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna make decisions about how I smell from now on just based on my diet,\u201d because [Laughs] there\u2019s a lot of other things at play, for sure."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Nope, sorry, what I\u2019ve heard is, I\u2019m going to live on a broccoli- and carrot-only diet from here on out\u2014with apples: broccoli, carrot and apples. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Quaglia","text":"And jelly beans. Don\u2019t forget the jelly beans."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Can\u2019t forget the jelly beans."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"That\u2019s all for today. Tune in on Friday, when we\u2019ll talk about people who made incredible scientific contributions that were lost\u2014or hidden\u2014in the passage of time."},{"author":"","text":"But before you go we\u2019d like to ask you for help for a future episode\u2014it\u2019s about kissing.
