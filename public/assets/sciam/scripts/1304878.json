But when I pulled my car off the road next to a metal fence behind a landfill and recycling center, I started to have some doubts."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Hey, Chuck."},{"author":"Chuck Black: ","text":"Yes?"},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"How\u2019s it going?"},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Good, Chris. The entrance to the landfill is not the most impressive entrance to a national natural monument, but it protects it a little bit."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"So is this the main entrance?"},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Yeah, this is the only entrance."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"This is Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly. I\u2019m Christopher Intagliata. I\u2019ve always been obsessed with visiting the more extreme corners of my home state, California. Back before Google Maps and Instagram and all that made it easy to see what stuff looked like before you get there, I\u2019d stare at a big paper AAA map of the state, find some place that looked interesting and drive there in my old Honda Accord. Those trips took me to the floor of a pitch black lava tube near the Oregon border, so dark inside I couldn\u2019t see two inches in front of my face, and all the way up to the crest of the White Mountains, wandering the bristlecone pines.\u00a0 But here was a place just a little over an hour from where I grew up that I\u2019d never even heard of: the Miramar Mounds National Natural Landmark. In a state full of superlatives\u2014the lowest basin and the highest peak in the lower 48, the tallest waterfall in North America, the largest trees in the world\u2014this place protects one of the tiniest wonders. It\u2019s way less iconic, for sure, but it\u2019s much more special to see\u2014and it\u2019s almost on the verge of disappearing.\u00a0 A wildlife biologist named Chuck Black had offered to show me around. He\u2019s a caretaker of sorts here. So I hop into his truck, and we drive down a muddy road. It\u2019s pretty flooded in places, too."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"Oh, wow, we\u2019re driving through water."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s fairly deep. But it\u2019s\u2014as long as you stay on the gravel part, you\u2019re okay."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"It rained a lot here in California this winter\u2014it\u2019s the wettest winter I can remember in a long time. And all that rain\u2019s been a really good thing for what I came to see: vernal pools. Vernal pools are a type of seasonal wetland\u2014they\u2019re these dried up muddy spots that, when the water hits them, they transform into shallow little ponds exploding with life. Chuck hops out of the truck and leads me to an overlook for a better view. It\u2019s a rolling, marshy landscape dotted with scrubby bushes and shrubs."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Vernal pools occur on these mesa tops, which were once at the bottom of an ocean. And when this was a level ocean floor, the shells of clams and crustaceans and things settled down over the millennia and formed a cemented layer, which is called a hard-pan layer."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"It\u2019s kinda like the bottom of a swimming pool."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"And so if you dig down a couple of feet, you\u2019d swear it was cement that somebody had put out at some time, and that\u2019s why the vernal pools exist."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"Right now, you can see the pools everywhere. At first glance, they\u2019re not all that much to look at. But if you zoom in a little closer, you\u2019ll see an abundance of life\u2014dozens of little invertebrates and plants, and they\u2019ve all adapted to take advantage of the opportunity these pools provide. Chuck stoops down next to one, our boots sinking into the mud, and he drags a little green aquarium net through the water. [CLIP: Sound of crouching next to the pool] On the first pass, he pulls up one of the most iconic residents of these pools: the fairy shrimp."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"So there we go. You see the fairy shrimp, those are really nice, nice large ones."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape): ","text":"And they have two tiny little beady eyes."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Yes, two little beady eyes. They, uh\u2026 [trails off]"},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"If you ever raised sea monkeys as a kid, these fairy shrimp are related. They\u2019re tiny, delicate little crustaceans. And if vernal pools had a mascot, it would probably be these fairy shrimp. In fact, since this natural landmark is on land owned by the Marines\u2014officially, it is Marine Corps Air Station Miramar\u2014the fairy shrimp actually have become somewhat of a mascot here. They actually make these little patches with them on it."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"We have a fighting fairy shrimp medallion that people really laugh at. It\u2019s a fairy shrimp holding a machine gun. And every year, soon after the fairy shrimp show up, I take an aquarium full of shrimp into the commanding officer's headquarters."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"I\u2019ll add that because Chuck is the resident wildlife biologist on this base, it probably fits within his job description to drop an aquarium full\u00a0of fairy shrimp at the commanding officer\u2019s desk."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"It's always fun to get that reaction when you take an aquarium full of shrimp and people see them for the first time."},{"author":"Intagliata (tape)","text":"I mean, they\u2019re quite delightful to watch swim."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"He takes me farther down the muddy trail to look at a smaller pool."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"Let\u2019s see. Here are some deer tracks. Deer came along, got stuck in the mud."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"He crouches down and grabs a little sprig of something\u2026."},{"author":"Black: ","text":"So this is San Diego mesa mint. If you pinch that and smell it\u2026"},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Black: \u2026","text":"oh yeah, it smells just like a mint. So that\u2019s San Diego mesa mint. And this one is San Diego button celery. That\u2019s Eryngium aristulatum\u2026."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"Both of those plants are endangered species. Several of the fairy shrimp species that live here are endangered, too. They\u2019re endangered because a lot of their habitat has been paved over or turned into supermarkets and farmland. Statewide, it\u2019s estimated 90 percent of the pools that once existed have been destroyed. And maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019d never even heard of this place or vernal pools at all. Most of them are gone. But the ones that are left harbor a disproportionate number of California\u2019s native species, compared with surrounding areas."},{"author":"Marie Simovich","text":"So there\u2019s branchiopods, ostracods, copepods, cladocerans.... And besides the crustaceans, there\u2019s a lot more."},{"author":"Intagliata: ","text":"Truly\u2014a lot more."},{"author":"Simovich: ","text":"There\u2019s worms, lots of kinds of insects. If you wanna get small, there\u2019s rotifers and other kinds of ... protozoans. There\u2019s bacteria, there\u2019s algae..., vascular plants. It\u2019s minestrone. In the next episode, we\u2019ll talk with biologist Marie Simovich and other scientists about the suite of different plants and animals\u2014beyond fairy shrimp\u2014that call these pools home and the one thing that unites a lot of them: a gift for living on the edge.
