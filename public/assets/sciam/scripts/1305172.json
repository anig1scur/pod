This is Lee Billings."},{"author":"Carin Leong","text":"And this is Carin Leong. [CLIP: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Carin, thanks for being here. A quick question for you: What\u2019s super-duper bright and hundreds or even thousands of times heavier than our entire solar system, yet it\u2019s so hard to find that it has yet to be directly seen?"},{"author":"Leong","text":"Hmm\u2026"},{"author":"Billings","text":"It\u2019s not a good riddle, I admit. The answer, though, is a \u201cPopulation III\u201d star. That\u2019s astronomer lingo for the very first stars in the universe, which formed from dense clouds of pristine hydrogen and helium that filled the cosmos in the first few hundred million years after the big bang. Those conditions should\u2019ve allowed Population III stars to bulk up to proportions impossible for more chemically enriched modern-day stars to achieve."},{"author":"Leong","text":"Right, okay. And these massive stars were also foundational for everything else we see in the universe today, right? So they were important cosmic ingredients that \u201cset the table\u201d for the evolution of things like galaxies, black holes, other types of stars, planets, and of course, us!"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Right! Exactly, yes. So we\u2019re talking about them today because scientists may have kinda-sorta seen them for the very first time."},{"author":"Leong","text":"How do you only \u201ckinda-sorta\u201d see an ultra-luminous gigantic star?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Right, well, these stars formed a very long time ago\u2013which in cosmic terms also means we can only see them by looking from very, very, very far away. They also didn\u2019t last very long due to how quickly they burned through all their stellar fuel\u2013each one existed for just a few million years, it\u2019s thought. These are bright but brief candles astronomers have to somehow see across a gap that encompasses almost the entire visible universe."},{"author":"Leong","text":"So\u2013let me guess\u2013that must mean observatories probably couldn\u2019t take an actual picture of a Population III star. So, maybe scientists look for their more subtle effects, and they have to use the biggest, best thing we\u2019ve got\u2026 ... the James Webb Space Telescope. Am I right?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Bingo, right you are. The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST for short, was custom-built to see the light from these first stars. So, recently two independent teams did just that\u2013using JWST to look for Population III stars. One team, led by Roberto Maiolino at the University of Cambridge, studied a galaxy called Gn-Z11 from just 400 million years post-big bang. Using a technique called spectroscopy, they were able to see that the light shining from the galaxy\u2019s edges seemed to come from very hot sources rich in helium but essentially devoid of heavier elements. Those are probably clouds of pristine gas in the galaxy\u2019s outskirts that are studded with Population III stars. The other team, led by Eros Vanzella at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy, used a massive galaxy cluster as a starlight-magnifying \u201cgravitational lens\u201d to zoom in on a tiny background galaxy from about 800 million years post-big bang. They found spectroscopic signs that the galaxy harbored two star-packed clumps with record-breaking low levels of elements heavier than helium. It\u2019s another possible sign of Population III stars."},{"author":"Leong","text":"Okay, so we\u2019re maybe seeing traces of these things. It\u2019s like we\u2019re seeing the light from this super bright source. We can\u2019t see the source exactly, but the colors of light it shines are telling us that it\u2019s coming from really pure primordial stuff."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Basically, yeah. You got it."},{"author":"Leong","text":"But outside of a simple existence proof, though, what else might this be telling us?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"If Maiolino\u2019s team has in fact seen Population III stars, their data suggests each would weigh at least 500 times as much as our sun. Now that generally fits with predictions, but having a bona fide confirmation would show us we\u2019re really on the right track in understanding our stellar forebears. And, among other things, the result from Vanzella\u2019s team is showing just how enormous the boost to JWST can be from galaxy-cluster gravitational lenses. It\u2019s paving the way for future JWST studies that, if we\u2019re lucky, might ultimately even resolve individual Population III stars. Think of that\u2014an actual image from across the depths of cosmic time, capturing one of the very first stars that ever was. It\u2019d probably just be a little dot or smear of light, though."},{"author":"Leong","text":"Sure\u2014but it\u2019d still be one of the most impressive \u201cbaby pictures\u201d ever made, right? Well worth including in a photo album. [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Leong","text":"Thank you for listening to Cosmos, Quickly.
