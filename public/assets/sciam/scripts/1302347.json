      "text": ": Where did life come from? How do stars and planets form? Professor Ewine van Dishoeck has devoted her career to answering these questions. In 2018, she received The Kavli Prize in Astrophysics for her work.\u00a0 Scientific American Custom Media, in partnership with The Kavli Prize, reconnected with Ewine to discuss the latest developments in unraveling the mysteries of space. Ewine van Dishoeck is known for studying the universe, but her career could have gone in a completely different direction.\u00a0"

      "text": "These dust grains make it possible for atoms to form everything from water to the hydrogen that helps an interstellar cloud collapse and turn into a star.\u00a0 But the dust isn\u2019t done yet! When a new star forms, the tiny particles swirl around it. Eventually, those pieces of dust collide and stick to each other."

And soon, we\u2019ll know if that same dust grew to form planets that other living beings call home. Ewine van Dishoeck is a professor of molecular astrophysics at Leiden University in the Netherlands. In 2018, she was the solo awardee for The Kavli Prize in Astrophysics. The Kavli Prize recognizes scientists for pioneering advances in the fields of astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience. The Kavli Prize is a partnership among the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, and the US-based Kavli Foundation.\u00a0 This work was produced by Scientific American Custom Media, and made possible through the support of The Kavli Prize."
