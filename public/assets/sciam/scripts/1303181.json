A metropolis of stars, with layers upon layers of history\u2014just like The Eternal City. So says the astronomer Hans-Walter Rix."},{"author":"Hans-Walter Rix: ","text":"There were glory days, there were disasters, and all of these things kind of happen in the life of galaxies. And the Milky Way is just the one galaxy where we can look at star by star so you can kind of see individual episodes in actual detail."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"Now Rix and a colleague at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany have indeed gone star by star\u2026 determining the ages of nearly a quarter million stars in the Milky Way. That work has allowed them to reconstruct some of the major life events in the galaxy's evolution, over its 13 billion years of existence."},{"author":"Rix","text":"What it showed is that indeed the youth and childhood of the Milky Way was turbulent\u2026 but actually afterwards we've lived an enormously sheltered life compared to most other galaxies. Gas drizzled in, and the suburbs grew peacefully and sprawled."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The astronomers say that the galaxy's thick disk began to form about 13 billion years ago, just 800 million years after the Big Bang. Then, around 11 billion years ago, a cataclysmic collision occurred: the Gaia-Enceladus satellite galaxy crashed into the Milky Way."},{"author":"Rix","text":"And just at the same time, there was a huge burst of star formation, or a large increase of star formation in our own Milky Way. And that suggests\u2014doesn't prove\u2014that the perturbance that this in-falling satellite created, caused a lot of gas that was in our Milky Way to form stars."},{"author":"Intagliata","text":"The details are in the journal Nature.
