      "text": "Learning about the carnivore morph\u2014what I think of as a tadpole werewolf\u2014is why I came to see David. The tadpoles in this particular vial are from the deserts of Arizona. The desert is a pretty tough environment for any organism to survive, but that\u2019s especially true for frogs, which need to stay moist to breathe and they usually lay their eggs in water. An amphibian surviving in the desert is like an ice cube surviving in a dutch oven. Making it work requires some pretty extreme adaptations. One of those is hibernation."

That\u2019s why they\u2019re called spadefoots, because they\u2019ve got this little keratinized spade on the back of their feet. And they basically sort of do this little wiggle dance, you know, to sort of dig into the ground. So they\u2019re digging backwards, if you want to think about it that way."

Some of these ponds can be as big as your whole house and maybe your backyard, you know, and so it just depends on the location. It depends on how much rain you get. But one thing that unites all the places where these toads breed is that they\u2019re all temporary. The males typically will arrive first, and then they\u2019ll start to call. They have very loud calls, like a lot of frogs, but these guys in particular have really loud calls. [CLIP: Sound of spadefoot frogs]"

As the pool of sludgy water gets smaller, the tadpoles gather closer and closer together until there\u2019s no water left, just a mound of tadpoles on top of the drying mud. On top of that, parasites and predators start to arrive. The tadpoles aren\u2019t poisonous, so they\u2019re an easy snack for snakes, birds and even insects such as wasps and beetles."

And I\u2019ve actually seen a number of times where they\u2019ll grab a tadpole, and they\u2019ll pull it up on the shore and then eat it."

The transformation is like a tadpole version of that scene in An American Werewolf in London. Their color changes from dark gray to gold. They double or triple in size. Their intestines get shorter to specialize in digesting meat. Their body shape changes from an oval to a diamond because their jaw muscles balloon and protrude from the sides of their head. To top it all off, sharp keratin beaks emerge from their gummy mouths. And soon their personality starts to match their smile."

They\u2019re just kind of, like, sitting there, maybe swimming really slowly. The carnivores, when you first walk up to a pond, you can just see them in the water.

So again, you\u2019ve got tons of tadpoles all crowded into a little tiny pond. And in circumstances like that, then the benefits of cannibalism might outweigh its costs."
