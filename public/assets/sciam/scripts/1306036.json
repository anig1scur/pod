The missiles came in 1962, when my grandmothers, Debra Malnourie and Carol Schulz, were in boarding school."},{"author":"Debra Malnourie","text":"Where was I in 1962? I think I was at Wahpeton Indian school."},{"author":"Weber","text":"In case you don\u2019t know, such boarding schools were founded to eliminate traditional American Indian ways of life and replace them with\u00a0 mainstream American culture."},{"author":"Carol Schulz","text":"There were rows upon rows of beds where everybody slept in the first night. You could hear everybody cry."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Just a decade prior to missiles being installed, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flooded more than a quarter of the reservation. That quarter consisted of nearly all of the agricultural land and 80 percent of the Fort Berthold population. Because of this, hundreds of families were forced to relocate as the water slowly crept up the valley. Homes, schools, graveyards, and churches were all flooded. With nearly all the resources gone, many families were forced to send their kids to boarding schools.\u00a0"},{"author":"Schulz","text":"Some of the kids spoke nothing but their native tongue. And I remember the first time I\u2019ve seen this woman just haul off and hit this little girl. And I\u2019m looking at her. I thought, \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d And you could see everybody around us, and I\u2019m looking at my sister, and she\u2019s looking at me, and you know\u2014and the next one, same thing, same language. And she got hit, too. That\u2019s when I realized when they said you cannot speak your language, you must speak English, you have to fit in, you have to change. And I remember thinking, \u201cWhat am I going to change into?\u201d You know, you don\u2019t know."},{"author":"Weber","text":"And just barely a decade after, when families were still readjusting to this new way of life, the U.S. military installed the nuclear missile silos. Sixty years later some things have changed, but others have not. I am at Princeton, with plans to major in public policy and international affairs. Meanwhile the silos are still on the reservation, and the U.S. Air Force plans to refurbish all of them and upload new nuclear missiles, with plans to keep them operational for the next 60 years. To tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t actually know there were missiles on the reservation until about a year ago, when Ryo sent me an e-mail. Basically, he told me Princeton\u2019s Program on Science and Global Security was working on a computer model to see what communities would be impacted by fallout in a potential nuclear war. One of the identified areas was my home region. I was intrigued, so I asked for a meeting to be set up with these researchers. The first one I spoke to was S\u00e9bastien Philippe, a French scientist and research scholar at Princeton. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"S\u00e9bastien Philippe: ","text":"For the past few years, I\u2019ve been researching the radiological consequences of nuclear weapon use and nuclear war."},{"author":"Weber","text":"S\u00e9bastien had been modeling the consequences of a concerted nuclear attack on U.S. missile silos and mapping areas that are most at risk."},{"author":"Philippe","text":"My goal is to understand the implications of nuclear weapon policy choices, and identify communities that will be most impacted by these choices."},{"author":"Weber","text":"What was unusual was that S\u00e9bastien had served as a nuclear weapon system safety engineer for the French government, so he knew the risks involved. And to my surprise, when he showed me his maps, the places I grew up knowing as home in Crookston, Minnesota, and in North Dakota were in an area that was completely lit up. When I pointed where I was from this is what Sebastien told me.\u00a0"},{"author":"Philippe","text":"So that dark area that shows the places where people could receive several times the radiation dose that result in near certain death."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Oh, wow. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"U.S. nuclear weapons can be launched from land-, sea- or air-based platforms. The U.S. military calls this the nuclear triad. I grew up 220 miles away from Minot, North Dakota, the only Air Force base to have two of the three legs in the nuclear triad. There are strategic bombers and nuclear missile silos. We just don\u2019t have the submarine-based missiles\u2014probably because Lake Sakakawea isn\u2019t deep enough. (For legal reasons, I\u2019ll point out that that is a joke.) Anyways, historically, they were placed there because by going over the North Pole, this was the shortest distance from the former Soviet Union. It was also chosen because the population density was much lower than, let\u2019s say, the East Coast, and should the nuclear weapons and bases be targeted, fewer people would die as a result. But\u2014it also happened to be right on the North East Segment of my tribe\u2019s reservation."},{"author":"Philippe","text":"When you're planning for nuclear war, silos are a prime military target, destroying them requires detonating one or two nuclear weapons at close proximity."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Basically, that means U.S. adversaries are probably targeting the 150 silos armed with nuclear missiles that are located in North Dakota. As I looked closer to the maps, I noticed the dark plumes in central North Dakota near where the reservation is. When we zoomed in, we realized that the targets were within the Fort Berthold reservation boundaries. There were 15 nuclear missile silos within those boundaries. This changed everything for me."},{"author":"Weber","text":"So that\u2026makes us a target?"},{"author":"Philippe","text":"Yeah, that makes you a target. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"I had minimal knowledge of nuclear weapons before I came to Princeton, so what Sebastien told me that day was, quite honestly, a lot to take in. There were nuclear missile silos on our land, and in the event of a nuclear war, my entire family would likely be dead within a month. That revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. You might also think you know how a nuclear explosion works. But let me ask S\u00e9bastien to break it down for you a little bit more."},{"author":"Philippe","text":"When a nuclear weapon is detonated\u2026 [CLIP: Archival tape of announcer counting down to an atomic bomb test]\u00a0"},{"author":"Philippe: \u2026 ","text":"inside of it, it starts a fission chain reaction that burns through the plutonium that is in the weapon. And also, that energy is used to light up the secondary part, or the fusion part of the weapon. So the nuclear explosion generates a gigantic fireball, and that fireball, if it interacts with the ground, it can suck up the dirt and tiny soil particles then fix the radioactivity generated by the explosion. So all of this radioactive dust lifts up in the air. That generates the big mushroom clouds we see in the movies.\u00a0 And those mushroom clouds, eventually, they are pushed by the high altitude winds and the particles start falling back to the ground as soon as the mushroom cloud is created, but because some of those particles are lifted up so high in the atmosphere they can take days, or even sometimes weeks, but it can take days for them to come back. And in that timeframe, they can travel hundreds of miles away.\u00a0 So really, it\u2019s like in 24 hours or 48 hours, you can have fallout that crosses the entire United States, or well into Canada, or even possibly get to Mexico across the border."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Basically, that\u2019s what nuclear fallout is. But Sebastien wanted to tell me more about its risks."},{"author":"Philippe","text":"When the particles you know, fall to the ground, and people are living in those areas, they get exposed to radiation from what is emitted, from those radioactive particles. Radiation can destroy cells, destroy your DNA. And when you get exposed to very high doses of radiation, you start seeing symptoms like people vomiting, losing their hair, internally bleeding and so on. It\u2019s just really awful."},{"author":"Weber","text":"I knew nuclear weapons existed, but I never really thought deeply about where they might be located or what the implications could be. But why would I? My mind was mostly preoccupied with the day-to-day stuff that college kids have to go through. I never really considered the possibility of a war with nuclear weapons. I was shocked, to say the least. Why were there nuclear missiles on tribal land? Did my family know about this? Did they know that the Air Force was planning to put new missiles on the reservation and keep them there for the next 60 years? I had so many questions circling in my head that day. I decided to go to the reservation, bring other Princeton folks with me, and meet with Grandma Debra to ask her what she knew about the silos."},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"Like, if you\u2019re going out of town here, there\u2019s one just before you hit that last hill going into Parshall. There\u2019s one on the right hand side. I think there might be another one out here. I\u2019m not sure."},{"author":"Weber (tape): ","text":"We have a map of all of them.... It\u2019s all public knowledge, where they are."},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"So where are they?"},{"author":"Weber (tape): ","text":"Do we have the map on there?"},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"Because I know in\u2014I know south of Parshall had some down that way, too. But I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still running or not."},{"author":"Weber","text":"While I had come for answers, it was I who broke the news to Debra that there were 15 silos on the reservation."},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"Wow, I didn\u2019t know that. I need to take notes [laughs]."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Even though she was alive when the silos arrived, she only learned about them when she came back from boarding school."},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"I really didn\u2019t know anything about this stuff until I came back. I think I was maybe 18, 19. I had no clue. I know there was some sites, but I didn\u2019t know what was in the sites. I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the sites, you know. But I don\u2019t think this is something that\u2014I think more people ought to know about this and get more reaction from them. You know, this, I\u2019m shocked about this. [CLIP: Music]\u00a0"},{"author":"Weber","text":"What Debra didn\u2019t know was that an Air Force general had come to Fort Berthold and presented a plan to modernize the missile silos. She also knew very little about what was behind the fence and under the ground and what she could do about it. So I decided I would figure this out for her, for me and for my community. And I started digging. This five-episode podcast is the result of what I found. I have to warn you: it\u2019s not a pretty story. And it begins by tackling the big question: How on earth did nuclear missiles arrive on our land? If you are Native American, the answer won\u2019t probably surprise you. Others, well, you should buckle up.
