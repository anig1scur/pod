I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"We\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors. On today\u2019s show, we\u2019re doing a refresher course on COVID. Fall and winter usually see a peak in virus cases, so we thought it would be a good time to talk about where we\u2019re at. That means knowing where COVID is spreading, how to stay safe and when you should test yourself. [CLIP: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I really haven\u2019t been worrying much about COVID for months now. It was summer, it was warm and nice outside, and the public health emergency ended last spring. Cases seemed low, so I wasn't thinking about the disease\u00a0all that much."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, me neither. I've had a nice little break from COVID for a few months now, really. But the virus is still there, and it's continuing to spread, so I'm starting to get my mask out again."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But a friend of mine just caught COVID for the third time. Another friend has been sick with it for three weeks. And it\u2019s getting to be fall and winter, seasons when the virus has peaked in the past."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, COVID isn\u2019t quite a seasonal virus yet, but it does seem to follow some seasonal patterns. It spreads easily when people are indoors, like we are much of the winter. And then you add in holidays and kids going back to school, and it\u2019s the perfect viral storm."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"These friends of mine, the ones who got sick, have been texting back and forth, arguing over the best time to use home COVID tests, and a bunch of other stuff that I think we all had a better handle on last year. I think we\u2019ve kind of forgotten some of the basics. So to catch up, we thought we\u2019d talk to someone who\u2019s been tracking the virus and public health for the whole pandemic: Katelyn Jetelina."},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"I\u2019m an epidemiologist and publisher of Your Local Epidemiologist.\u00a0I do a lot of contracting work with the CDC, also adjunct at University of Texas Health Science Center."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Your Local Epidemiologist is a newsletter that\u2019s become a go-to source for hundreds of thousands of people because Katelyn explains COVID research in plain English and turns it into advice for readers trying to figure out how to stay as safe as they can."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"One of the first things I wanted to know was: How do I know if COVID cases are rising in my community, so I can take extra care? And, here\u2019s what Katelyn said:"},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"Yeah, this is really challenging to do, especially on a local level. I, [in] particular, know a lot of other epidemiologists are focused on wastewater."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Wastewater is sewer water, essentially. If people are infected with the virus and use the bathroom, that virus gets flushed down the drain. Then scientists can test for it. If levels go up week after week, it means the virus is spreading in the community."},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"For example, in San Diego, we have a fantastic wastewater system for viral surveillance. But really you just need like a regional kind of trend because wastewater is good for\u00a0looking at trends. And so if that trend in your region is increasing, then, like you said, you're gonna start hearing more and more people getting infected.\u00a0 The wastewater dashboard I use is Biobot. It's super, it's pretty, it's straightforward."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Biobot is a company that works with public health agencies to monitor viruses in the water. And they do have a pretty nice trend dashboard on their website, which you can Google. Be warned, though. It doesn\u2019t get super local. For instance, I\u2019m pulling it up here on my phone. I live in Maryland, so I\u2019m looking there for the county I live in\u2014and it\u2019s not listed. It\u2019s just not there. What about you, Tanya?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Let me take a look and see if they have one for Brooklyn\u2014or King\u2019s County, where I live. Um, but, I do not see anything. And I don\u2019t see anything for New York City, so the closest one is Nassau County in Long Island."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So wastewater isn\u2019t perfect. There are gaps in Biobot\u2019s coverage, but there are other programs that might fill in. And wastewater is better than some other indicators."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, like the number of people testing positive for the virus, or case rates. Katelyn doesn\u2019t think those numbers are very reliable anymore."},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"So as we left the pandemic emergency, as fatigue has certainly crawled in, people are stopping to test. So certainly case data is not anything I would pay attention to."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"She did mention something new, which I hadn\u2019t heard about, which is a way to look at COVID and the flu together."},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"We're going into the fall, winter season\u2014and there's going to be a lot of crap out there. And so one thing I know the CDC is updating, which should be in the next week or two, is a respiratory map by state."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The CDC has long had a tracker for flu-like illnesses, but during the pandemic they had a separate tracker for COVID. And now that\u2019s changing."},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"That COVID number is going to be folded into this respiratory outlook. And I'll probably be using that to really determine when to wear a mask, for example, because I don't want flu or RSV or COVID or norovirus or whatever is out there."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Another thing I wanted to know about was what to do if you think you\u2019ve been exposed. I know Katelyn said a lot of people don\u2019t do rapid home antigen tests anymore. But plenty still do. So you get a call from a friend who you just had lunch with. And she says she just tested positive. Should you test yourself?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The tests are most accurate at detecting infection once the virus has had a few days to replicate in your body. The advice from the FDA and the CDC is to wait five days after exposure and then test."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But Katelyn pointed out there are lots of times you don\u2019t know the exact time or day of exposure. And also that with new variants, viral loads seem to build more slowly, so it may be more useful to wait until you actually start seeing symptoms, like a runny nose, cough, a fever, the usual stuff. And then wait out a few days of those before testing."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So\u2014you shouldn\u2019t take a home antigen test during the first two days you feel sick?"},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"Yeah, third day, it may start increasing your viral load. But yeah, those first two days\u2014there's a high likelihood of a false negative on your antigen test."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Good to know. So, when COVID is on the rise, what\u2019s the best way to keep yourself safe?"},{"author":"Jetelina","text":"Wear a mask. Like, I have two toddlers I need to take care of. I'm traveling all the time for work. Like I just don't have time to get sick and so I wear a mask. Wearing a mask helps\u00a0protect you, it helps protect those around you. Taking an antigen test a couple of days after symptoms, getting a vaccine. I mean, just go get your vaccines by Halloween. You may get infected, but you're not going to end up at the hospital."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So that\u2019s the advice from your local epidemiologist. We\u2019re not in the same place we were in previous years, but COVID is still a risk. We have the tools to protect ourselves. Let\u2019s use them.
