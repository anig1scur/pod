There are also plants that can treat you when you\u2019re sick and even plants that many of our modern medicines are derived from. I\u2019m Shayla Love, and you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly.

I started working in my community garden in Brooklyn last year, and the couple of hours a week I spend with my hands in the dirt clears my mind. What we grow isn't medicine but rather vegetables and fruits to feed our neighbors. Whenever I\u2019m visiting a city, if I have the time, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for a garden. The bigger the city, the better the trip: gardens provide an oasis away from the urban din. When you\u2019re deep in the center of one, the only noises you hear around you are the buzzing of bees and swishing of leaves.\u00a0 But ultimately nature is healing not because it\u2019s separate from us but because of our relation to it and how we\u2019ve always used plants to modify, help or harm our body in some way.\u00a0"
