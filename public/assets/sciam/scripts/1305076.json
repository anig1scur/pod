So he and some colleagues studied the skulls of giant terror birds and they found something really strange. This gets very detailed very fast but the bird\u2019s-eye view: for most living birds, there\u2019s some flexibility in the skull, including at the hinge where the beak attaches to the skull, so the beak can move a bit. But Dino\u2019s research shows that it\u2019s different for big terror birds. Their beak is fused to their skull, kinda like, say, an ax\u00a0blade is fused to a wooden handle. So you guessed it.\u00a0"
