For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today I\u2019m talking to associate editor Andrea Thompson, who covers the environment, energy and earth sciences for SciAm. She\u2019s here to tell us why we\u2019re not likely to beat this heat anytime soon and to give us some tips on how we can keep each other safe\u2014even on the most sweltering days. So it feels like summer has gotten a lot worse since I was a kid\u2014honestly since I first moved to the New York City area, like, a little more than a decade ago. Is there data to back that up?"

      "text": "There absolutely is, and I know exactly what you mean. I grew up in Atlanta and moved to New York 15 or so years ago, and summers now feel more like the summers I remember in Atlanta growing up, which is not, as far as I\u2019m concerned, not a good thing, but there is a ton of data backing up that summers really do that\u2014they are as bad as they feel like they are. Temperatures are actually some of the most robust trends we have in terms of climate change. We have much longer data. It\u2019s very good-quality data that\u2019s taken, especially in the U.S., from all over, and it\u2019s very clear that summers are getting hotter sort of at every scale\u2014so from the scale of the globe down to the local level. You know, you see more year-to-year variation from the weather at the local level because it has a bigger impact, whereas at the global level, that sort of gets ironed out a little bit. But, you know, we can tell that summers are hotter, that the heat waves that happen in those summers are happening more often, are lasting longer, are more intense, they start earlier in the year, and they hang around longer. And there were several particularly big heat waves last summer that helped lead it to be the [Northern Hemisphere\u2019s] hottest summer in the last 2,000 years."

We have seen really terrible heat in Mexico since the beginning of May. There were howler monkeys dropping out of trees from dehydration and heatstroke, birds having to be rescued and put into air-conditioning, obviously people being very affected. And we\u2019ve started to see that more in the mainland U.S. now. There is a recent heat wave across the West, and now it\u2019s hitting us in the East."

      "text": "There was a really great quote from the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, a couple years ago, when she was referring to some of the heat waves that year, and she said something like, \u201cThis [hot] summer is [going] to be one of the coolest ... of the rest of our lives.\u201d And that really struck me\u2014and I actually did a story about it\u2014but essentially what is record-breaking now is going to be an average summer in 20, 30 years, and the nature of climate change, because we\u2019re continually adding heat to the atmosphere, we are stacking the deck towards more record heat and away from record cold. And of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that every summer is hotter than the last because you do still have variation, and it depends on where you are, but in\u00a0 general."

      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Heat, in general, is dangerous because it stresses out our bodies. So if you\u2019re subjected to heat, especially if you\u2019re not hydrating, your body starts to dehydrate: your blood gets thicker, and your heart has to work a lot harder to pump it."

    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Yeah, exactly. And if you\u2019re not hydrating, your body doesn\u2019t have, you know, those reserves to sweat, which is our body\u2019s natural cooling system. That\u2019s what sweat is. Even though it makes us feel gross, it\u2019s actually really helpful to us."

    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Yes, exactly. And one of the reasons heat is particularly dangerous for certain groups\u2014like those older individuals, very young children\u2014is that their bodies aren\u2019t as good at regulating their temperature, at taking, you know, advantage of these sort of natural systems, so they have a much harder time adjusting to the heat. And there\u2019s also people with certain health conditions, especially related to the heart or lungs, are generally at higher risk. If you have\u2014are on certain medications, some of those can impede the sweating process, and a lot of people aren\u2019t aware of that. And it\u2019s sort of lack of awareness that can actually be one of the bigger problems with heat because it\u2019s sort of this invisible threat. You know, when we think about tornadoes, we envision the funnel cloud. With hurricanes you can, you can show people what storm surge coming in looks like. But it\u2019s really hard to visualize heat. And we actually\u2014when we\u2019re doing stories and trying to find photos, it\u2019s really hard to find photos that telegraph heat really well. And so that makes it really hard to sort of get people to understand what the problem is. And another problem is: we know the death toll from other extreme hazards pretty quickly\u2014in the aftermath, generally\u2014but heat, there can be a disconnect because it can take days, weeks, even months to know what the full death toll from a heat wave is. And, you know, these are what one expert told me are called mass casualty events, but we don\u2019t really think of them like that because we don\u2019t get those numbers until so far after the event has happened. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s sort of that and the fact that basically, you know, we have heat waves now that aren\u2019t like the ones we grew up with or our parents grew up with or our grandparents grew up with. And we tend to base our assessments of risk on our past experience. So if the future, or even the present, isn\u2019t a match for the past, that means people may not be making decisions based on the information they really need to, and there\u2019s a lot of, also, lack of awareness and understanding of a lot of the heat measures that we use."

    {
      "author": "Feltman: ",
      "text": "Yeah, well I would love to talk a little bit more about those measures of heat because,\u00a0 we hear about heat index, we hear about wet bulb more and more now. So could you maybe demystify some of that?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "Heat index is the temperature plus humidity. You know, when it\u2019s more humid, it makes bearing the heat a lot harder. \u201cFeels like\u201d and/or apparent temperature are temperature, humidity and windchill\u2014although it\u2019s hard to think of windchill in the summer\u2014but it\u2019s basically when it\u2019s breezy out, cools you down because it helps that sort of evaporative cooling process, that sweating is. Global wet-bulb temperature is all of those things, plus looking at cloud cover and how much sun you\u2019re exposed to because obviously it\u2019s much cooler if you\u2019re in the shade than if you\u2019re in the direct sunlight. The problem with global wet bulb\u2014even though it is a really good sort of all-encompassing measure\u2014the numbers it gives you are very hard to sort of interpret because, you know, a global wet bulb in the 80s [Fahrenheit] is when you start feeling a lot of discomfort, and around 90 [degrees F] is just oppressive. But when you think of temperature, you don\u2019t think, \u201cEighty-six [degrees F]\u2014oh, that\u2019s super dangerous.\u201d So it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s a little hard to give that information to people and have them be able to sort of reconcile that with temperatures. From, like, a personal standpoint, when I\u2019m trying to figure out what it\u2019s going to be like, I look at the temperature, and I look at the dew point. And so the dew point is basically what the temperature would have to cool to to get 100 percent relative humidity\u2014so to the point where you couldn\u2019t have any more water vapor in the atmosphere. You don\u2019t actually have to understand that to look at a dew point measure and know what it means. So if you have a dew point that is generally under, say, 55, you\u2019re pretty comfortable. It\u2019s really nice. If you\u2019re in the 55 to 65, that\u2019s when you start to feel sticky, a little \u201cugh.\u201d And then anything over 65 is when it starts getting just\u2014like we used to joke when I grew up in Atlanta\u2014like, you feel like you\u2019re swimming through the air."

    },
    {
      "author": "Thompson: ",
      "text": "From what I\u2019ve heard from experts that study risk communication in heat health, people understand that, that there is risk to those groups when it is very hot out, but even in focus groups that were done all over the country, with people who were 65 and over, you know, they knew that that sort of age category was a risk, but when asked if they personally saw themselves at risk, they would often answer \u201cno\u201d because, you know, they still felt healthy. They were like, \u201cI\u2019m still independent. I am able to, to do all these things.\u201d So they didn\u2019t\u2014you know, they\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m not frail.\u201d And so understanding that that\u2019s not necessarily the indicator of, of risk. And there was a lot of sort of not understanding that, say, heat index\u2014they knew, you know, that that\u2019s supposed to tell you information about how dangerous it is, but they didn\u2019t know that heat index is temperature with humidity factored in and that when you factor in humidity, that really changes some of the risk with heat."

      "text": "The more we do to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, the less hot they will be. And there is a great study that showed, you know, for kids born around 2020, with current pledges from governments to reduce emissions, they will experience about seven times as many heat waves over the course of their life as people born in 1960. If we keep emissions to where we limit warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius [2.7 degrees F] above preindustrial, that will only be four times as many. So obviously that\u2019s still more, but that\u2019s still\u2014you know, I, I would take that difference. But in terms of sort of today, hydration is key and to drink before you\u2019re thirsty.\u00a0 If you feel like you\u2019re thirsty, you\u2019re already starting to push it. Being aware of some of the symptoms of heat illness\u2014so dizziness, confusion. The problems with those are they can be hard to be aware of in yourself when you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019re past them, but they\u2019re good to know of to help monitor other people, especially if you have family, friends, neighbors that are older, that if you have young children\u2014you know, people in these high-risk categories. Paying attention to those people, checking in on them is really important. Limiting your time outdoors as much as you can. If you do need to go outdoors, doing it, you know, early in the morning or later in the evening, when you\u2019re not going to be in direct sunlight. Taking frequent breaks\u2014hopefully inside, in air-conditioning. Obviously not everyone has access to air-conditioning, or maybe they have an air conditioner but aren\u2019t sure if they can afford to run it. There\u2019s a lot of inequitable access to air-conditioning. Some cities, like New York, have cooling centers available for people who don\u2019t have air-conditioning. These are often libraries or other sort of public places. A lot of the problem there is that they may only be open during the day, and overnight heat is actually some of the most dangerous because your body doesn\u2019t get the chance to recover. If you\u2019re limited in when you can run the air conditioner, doing it at night to give your body that recovery time is a good idea. You can do things like putting ice or cold cloths on your feet, hands, neck\u2014that can help sort of cool you down\u2014running a fan."

      "text": "So there is, and that\u2019s been a growing thing in a lot of places in the U.S. in recent years. So a number of cities and at least one state, Arizona, have a position for heat officer. So it\u2019s someone that can sort of coordinate all these things\u2014 because if you want to reach the unhoused, if you want to reach older people, if you want to reach people in certain neighborhoods or communities, you have to know the organizations that work there, you know, how to get the message to those people. And, you know, the idea of heat officers is that they can sort of coordinate all of this information and sort of give each of these groups the information they need to, to take to these populations. A lot of them are trying to get more things like cooling centers. Some city governments\u2014I know Phoenix has been ahead on this\u2014are looking at ways to actually combat heat in the city by painting roofs or roads to reflect some of the heat back, planting trees, putting misters at bus stops and things like that. So there are sort of practical, on-the-ground measures, as well as just having someone who is sort of coordinating policy ..."

      "text": "Exactly. And you\u2019re starting to see those in more and more places\u2014and not just in the U.S. There are also questions on sort of what could be done at the federal level. So FEMA, the Federal Emergency\u2014the Federal Emergency Management Agency, gives money for whenever the president declares a disaster somewhere, there\u2019s funds that are made available to help that state or city deal with whatever that disaster is. Typically that happens with things like hurricanes, floods\u2014you know, these more visible hazards. But there are petitions from experts saying that we should be doing this for heat, that when there is a major heat wave event\u2014especially one that lasts days or weeks on end, which happened last year in the Southwest\u2014that, you know, we should make money available to help those communities protect their citizens from heat, that it would give them more funds to do that. You know, whether, whether that happens, we have to see. From what people say, the, the legislation that sort of governs that would currently allow for that. So it\u2019s a matter of FEMA deciding whether or not they\u2019re going to do it. So far, attempts to, to get that funding for heat events hasn\u2019t happened, but, you know, whether that may change\u2014especially as we see these happen more often, and they are lasting for weeks on end, that, that\u2014 maybe that will tip things. It\u2019s hard to know. There are also calls to broaden the subsidies made available for people to climate-control their homes. Basically we provide a lot for heat in the winter, but we don\u2019t really for cooling in the summer, so to increase the funding for that to make access to air-conditioning more equitable."
