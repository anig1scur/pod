      "text": ": East of Los Angeles, there's a landlocked salty lake called the Salton Sea. Once advertised as a swanky tourist destination in the 1950s and 60s, it's now drying up. Toxic dust from the exposed lake bed is severely impacting the health of local residents. This is Scientific American's Science, Quickly. I'm Kate Furby. [CLIP: Show theme music]"

Then you remember that you're in an environment where, at any moment, the wind could pick up and bring the toxicity from the playa of the drying sea into your body."

      "text": "The Salton Sea is the largest lake in California, but it actually started out as an accident. One hundred and fifty years ago, it didn't even exist. It was basically just a dry valley. Then in 1905 a canal breached and flooded the ancient lake bed with water from the Colorado River, which created an oasis. [CLIP: Miracle in the Desert (Salton City promotional film, 1968)]"

      "text": ": But the salts and chemicals in the water accumulated and the area became too harsh for most life. The era of the Salton Sea holiday getaway was over. Today the lake is around 50 percent saltier than the Pacific Ocean. The Eastern Coachella Valley is estimated to be home to about 34,000 people, including more than 6,000 Pur\u00e9pecha, an indigenous Mexican community. The area is struggling with environmental hazards that are impacting their health and their children's health."

Every year, the sea shrinks, and the dusty, barren looking lake bed that surrounds it gets bigger. Less water means more dust\u2014more dust that is harming humans and wildlife."

And while kids' lungs are still developing, they are even more vulnerable. But even still, children living near the Salton Sea are getting much sicker than they would be if it was just regular old dust."

      "author": "Aronson",
      "text": ": Exactly. We've been sequencing those microbes sound in dust, and for all of these different groups of microbes that we're identifying, we're trying to figure out are there certain, um, microbes that are known to produce toxic chemicals?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Furby",
      "text": ": For example, with the Salton Sea drying out, the microbes that normally live in the water might be experiencing extreme stress, the same way that when you're stressed, you sweat and smell bad. But these microbes could be producing hazardous compounds as a byproduct. And then that compound gets attached to the dust and blown into the communities where people are getting sick."
    },
    {
      "author": "Aronson",
      "text": ": There's some simple things, um, that many microbes produce that, if they were produced in excess in this area for some reason, theoretically could cause some of these, um, some of these symptoms. So we're right in the middle of this. We don't have answers right now. Um, but we've been collecting dust and these other types of samples for years and, um, I've been sequencing them. We're looking for genes responsible for the production of chemicals that could be harmful to humans."

      "text": ": And this isn't an isolated incident. Environmental issues that occur in economically disadvantaged communities have been overlooked before. Communities that struggled with contaminated water, such as Flint, Mich., or Hinckley, Calif., these are low-income areas that need to employ environmental cleanup and need government action to do so. In these cases, it took a lot of work from scientists, local residents, and journalists to get support for action. While the Salton Sea's future feels uncertain, the communities and scientists are working hard together. To try to understand the roots of the problems and how to address them.
