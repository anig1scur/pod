      "text": "Robots can do a lot of things. They can build cars. Stock grocery shelves. Process COVID tests in an automated laboratory. But can a robot change your mind? Well, that depends. Because a new study shows that robots are more persuasive when they\u2019re presented as a peer, as opposed to an authority figure. The findings appear in the journal Science Robotics."

So in retail environments, in care homes, in schools and things like that. So robots don\u2019t have the luxury of just being functional anymore."

      "text": "You\u2019d often see residents that would refuse to eat their meal or they wouldn\u2019t want to take their medication that day. So you have a care provider have to sit there for 10, 15, 20 minutes having a conversation, reminding that person how important it is."

    {
      "author": "Hopkin",
      "text": "To figure out how to make robots more influential, Saunderson set up a series of tasks. In half the tasks, Saunderson played the role of the experimenter and he would introduce the robot, a programmable off-the shelf model named Pepper, as the participants\u2019 peer."
    },
    {
      "author": "Saunderson",

      "author": "Hopkin",
      "text": "And what Saunderson found was that Pepper had better luck at getting people to change their response when acting as a fellow test-taker, not as a leader. Now, that could be because participants didn\u2019t view the robot as being a legitimate authority figure. Or because there\u2019s something deeply creepy about a bossy robot\u2026especially one that reminds you that your winnings will be docked if your answers are incorrect."

      "text": "This isn\u2019t saying you can\u2019t ever put a robot in charge. You just need to be very conscious and cautious with it. It shouldn\u2019t be dominant. It shouldn\u2019t be authoritative. It shouldn\u2019t maybe even try to be an authority figure."

We shouldn\u2019t hurt that thing.\u201d So, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of very subtle things you can do to give robots a slight hand up, for sure."

To learn more about these efforts, and AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer work in general, Scientific American Custom Media caught up with Chatrick Paul, the Head of US Oncology Business for AstraZeneca. Welcome, Chatrick Paul, I'm so excited for this opportunity to talk with you about your work."

But we also know that it is just one part of the puzzle. And that this ambition is going to take more than just solving the scientific and technical challenges of controlling and overcoming cancerous cells, we recognize that it is going to take the resolution of multiple other issues and the joint effort of many in the community to reach that goal. So with that in mind, we launched our YOUR Cancer program. Through YOUR Cancer, we seek to convene the oncology community to drive meaningful change and to provide the resources and the platforms to elevate the difference-makers in the community who are working to create positive change. The C2 awards are an integral part of this program and they serve to recognize and celebrate those individuals and organizations who are making great strides in our fight against cancer. And so our hope is that by shining the light on these change makers, and through highlighting their work, we are also empowering others to take that first step."

A lot of the things need to fall in line in the journey of each patient for that promise to be realized. And for patients to really have those health outcomes that are possible. And this would include things like screening, timely detection, appropriate diagnosis, effective treatment and care."

      "author": "Paul",
      "text": "\u00a0Yeah, it's actually an incredible time for us to reflect on this because as you know, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act. So if you look since 1971, we have seen a decline in cancer-related deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, from 1991 to 2018, cancer death rates fell by 31%. What that tells me is that we are winning the war against cancer. And I believe this is a direct result of expansions in screening, early diagnosis programs as well as advancement in treatment. Some of the greatest advancements have come from the revolution in precision medicine. Over time, we've learned that some cancers are driven by individual genes or by specific mutations at the molecular level. With that understanding, we're able to develop targeted therapies that address the unique characteristics of a person's tumor. And so it is really delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time."

      "text": "\u00a0Notwithstanding the incredible progress we've been able to make to date, there are still so many patients with unmet needs. And so my hope is that we will expand greater access to the latest technologies available to screen tests and treatments that will help deliver the full promise of precision medicine to patients who really can benefit from them. It's also my hope that there will be continued deep interdisciplinary partnerships. I know we have a long way to go. But I am truly encouraged by the strides we continue to make across the entire oncology community towards redefining cancer care together."
