But it just as often allows us awe-inspiring glimpses into feats our species accomplished without the aid of technologies we now take for granted. It can also force us to confront historical practices that shock our modern sensibilities\u2014and leave us grappling with thorny ethical questions. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to the final episode of our three-part Fascination series on extreme archaeology. If you\u2019re just tuning in, make sure to circle back to the episodes we posted last Friday and the Friday before that. You\u2019ll hear about everything from the surprising sophistication of prehistoric stargazing to the study of ingenious ancient fishing techniques that have persisted to this day. Back again with us is the award-winning documentary filmmaker and journalist Kata Kar\u00e1th. She\u2019s taking us on one more adventure\u2014this time to the top of a mountain with a climate so extreme it\u2019s practically alien\u2014to introduce us to archaeologists who study human sacrifice. Before we get started, a quick note about language: Quechua was the primary language spoken among the Inka, and its varieties are widely spoken today in the Andean regions where the Inka Empire extended. Throughout this episode, we use Quechua words where possible. The pronunciations you\u2019ll hear reflect the way the language is currently spoken by the descendants of the peoples who lived in the part of the Inka Empire that included what is now northern Argentina. We\u2019ve also provided the corresponding Spanish or English words and spellings in the transcript where appropriate. We want to make sure to mention, by the way, that the Quechua language family includes many different local varieties and that these are and were only some of the languages spoken among Indigenous communities in the Andes. You can check out this episode\u2019s transcript for more detailed notes on language. We\u2019d like to extend our thanks to Carlos Molina-Vital, a linguist and language teacher who specializes in Quechua, for his help in this area. Lastly, please be advised that this episode contains content that may disturb some listeners, including discussions of child sacrifices. You can find a more detailed content warning in this episode\u2019s show notes.

Its summit was the final resting place of Inka [in English: Inca] human sacrifices. By the way, while the mountain is known today as Llullaillaco, following Spanish conventions, its name at the time of the Inka was likely Llullayllaku. You will hear me use both words throughout this episode, depending on whether we\u2019re talking about modern or Inka times. [This script uses the spelling \u201cLlullaillaco\u201d when discussing the mountain and expeditions to it in modern times. The spelling \u201cLlullayllaku\u201d is used when referring to the burial site and pilgrimage place during the time of the Inka.] This next part may be disturbing for some listeners."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"We found traces of chicha [in Southern Quechua: aqha], which is alcohol. The Inka priests prepared them to be sleepy when they were sacrificed on the summit. We found that the children also had coca [in Southern Quechua: kuka] leaves, probably chewed as part of the ceremony, but [I imagine] also against altitude sickness."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"According to a prominent hypothesis among archaeologists, these were the last moments of three children who were sacrificed more than 500 years ago at the summit of Llullayllaku. Researchers have estimated that the children\u2014a teenage girl, along with a young boy and girl\u2014had likely walked nearly 900 miles [more than 1,400 kilometers] by this time. They started from Qusqu in what is now Peru. Today that city is known in English as Cuzco. [\u201cQusqu\u201d is the official Southern Quechua spelling for the likely name of the city during the Inka Empire, though it is often written \u201cQosqo\u201d as a result of Spanish influence. Cuzco can also be spelled \u201cCusco.\u201d]. At the time Qusqu was the capital of Tawantinsuyu [in Spanish: Tahuantinsuyo], as the Inka called their empire. They likely stopped at various sacred sites during their monthslong pilgrimage. Then they were sacrificed as part of a ceremony called qhapaqucha [in Spanish: capacocha]. It\u2019s thought that these sacrifices happened for a number of different reasons: for instance, to provide offerings to the gods or to mark key events in the empire. Something to keep in mind here is that much of researchers\u2019 understanding of day-to-day life in the Inka Empire comes from accounts written by colonizers from Spain. Though some sources from the time period do include Inka voices, many don\u2019t. And it\u2019s important to consider the limitations and intentions behind these foreign accounts. For example, as one archaeologist has described, accounts of Inka spiritual life were often written by Catholic clerics, quote, \u201cin order to destroy the very practices they describe.\u201d We should note that these accounts aren\u2019t the only means of understanding the traditions of the Inka Empire and of the Andean peoples who became part of it. Elements of the Indigenous belief systems that predated the arrival of the Spanish are still alive in many Andean communities today. In 1999 an international team of high-altitude archaeologists unearthed the Llullayllaku children\u2019s highly intact mummified remains. This allowed for very detailed scientific analyses. It also fueled ongoing debates about excavating ancient sites and studying, displaying and storing ancient human remains, especially those with ties to modern-day Indigenous groups. Diego, by the way, is the director of the UNESCO Qhapaq \u00d1an, Andean Road System World Heritage site in Salta, Argentina. He used to work at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology in Salta, where the mummified Llullayllaku children are currently on display. Diego and his colleagues are trying to understand why the Inka worshipped mountains\u2014and how their special connection to the apukuna, or mountain deities, might have helped them establish the largest-ever empire in the Americas.

It\u2019s not only one of the highest active volcanoes in the world\u2014it also lies on the edge of the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. [CLIP: Rolling thunder]"},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Its harsh beauty comes with a steep price. The weather can change in a flash. Lightning storms are common, and winds can reach many tens of miles [10 miles is about 16 kilometers] per hour. Temperatures can drop to \u201322 degrees Fahrenheit [\u201330 degrees Celsius] and sometimes even lower."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"One afternoon a blizzard suddenly started in the mountain, and it was so freezing, so cold that we had to run down the mountain, and when we reached our 4x4 car and tried to start the engine, the cold was so strong that the gasoline in the tank froze."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Get caught in the wind and chill, and you might lose some fingers or toes to frostbite. And so high-altitude archaeologists such as Diego are trained mountaineers as well. In addition to monitoring the precarious weather conditions, they must watch out for altitude sickness, caused by the reduction in oxygen. The most serious cases can lead to pulmonary or cerebral edema, which can be deadly. They pack lightly and work swiftly. Still, this imposing peak once drew its share of visitors. Located in the southern region of the Inka Empire, it was a wak'a, which refers to a sacred site or object. At the foothills of Llullayllaku laid a sort of base camp for imperial messengers and procession participants, including lodgings for travelers and a cemetery. Multiple sections of the Qhapaq \u00d1an Inka road system led to it, likely providing a clear path all the way up to the summit. [CLIP: \u201cLet There Be Rain,\u201d by Silver Maple]"},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"But before we talk more about what it\u2019s like at the top of the mountain, let\u2019s learn about the lives of the children of Llullayllaku. Who were they? Why were their lives, like those of so many others, sacrificed? Even before the Inka many Andean cultures considered the whole landscape\u2014including lakes, rivers and springs\u2014sacred, because it nurtured their crops and livestock. And with mountains rising along the horizon as far as the eye can see, their prominent role continues among many communities in the Andes today. The Inka believed that apukuna had power over water\u2014and as a result, the fertility of the land. Mountains were considered connection points that linked the Earth, the underworld and the sky. They served as homes to gods and spirits that controlled meteorological and geological phenomena. To maintain a good relationship with the mountains, Diego says, the Inka believed that offerings must be made\u2014and they had to be valuable."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"The children who were chosen to be offered to the mountain were usually sons or daughters of chiefs, so they were the children of important people [in an] Inka village, [or] they were from the [tribes] that the Inka conquered. The tribal leaders were told to make a tribute to the Inka and send their own children."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"This meant that children from all over the Inka Empire were chosen, often in an effort to seal or maintain political alliances, and sent to Qusqu to be prepared to be sacrificed."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"I know that the boy was probably Mapuche, from this Indigenous group from the south of Chile and Argentina, because they\u2019ve studied his DNA, and it contained the genetic traces of the Mapuche people."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Archaeologists believe the boy and the younger girl were around four or five years old, while the older girl was probably around 13."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"And when you see her, it\u2019s quite spectacular because she is like a Sleeping Beauty."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"I saw her for myself. The girl known as the Llullaillaco Maiden [researchers generally refer to the Maiden using the Spanish spelling of the mountain\u2019s name] was sitting cross-legged with her arms folded in a glass cylinder on the second floor of the High Altitude Archaeology Museum. Her small head was tilted over her right shoulder, with some of her tightly braided black hair gently falling over her closed eyes. You may remember I mentioned earlier that some believe the children should not be displayed; we'll talk more about that soon. All three children were buried in a shrine on a ceremonial platform just a few feet below Llullayllaku\u2019s summit. The child referred to as the Llullaillaco Boy [researchers generally refer to the Boy using the Spanish spelling of the mountain\u2019s name] was found tied up, his head resting over his knees in a fetal position, while the other girl\u2019s face and upper body were burned, suggesting she was struck by lightning after her death. Archaeologists generally refer to her as the Girl of Lightning. Just as Diego says, the children\u2019s bodies and the offerings buried with them are eerily well-preserved. The color of their garments is still vibrant. The white feathers on the Boy\u2019s headdress look like they were plucked from a bird yesterday. The golden and silver human and llama figurines buried with them are still whole and shiny. Five hundred years later these children are frozen in time."},{"author":"Steve Schmidt","text":"Why didn\u2019t they decay?"},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"That\u2019s Steve Schmidt, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, who specializes in the microbes of extreme environments."},{"author":"Schmidt","text":"Well, the key to that, in my opinion, is that they were buried down about, I think, at least a meter [about 3.3 feet] under the ground on top of the volcano. And so it\u2019s a combination of the really cold temperatures at that elevation and the fact that even though it snows up there\u2014and there\u2019s actually snow often on the ground on the peak of those volcanoes\u2014most of the snow sublimates when the sun hits it, so it\u2019s not soaking in. So the mummies were, like, in a very cold, frozen environment, and they were kept dry because they were far enough down that water never penetrated to where they were."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"When Steve first saw photos of the children of Llullayllaku, he was deeply intrigued. What place on Earth could be so extreme that it forced even microbes\u2014some of which thrive in the planet\u2019s harshest environments\u2014to stand still? Since then he has led multiple expeditions to Llullaillaco to find answers. As it turns out, conditions near the summit are out of this world\u2014almost literally."},{"author":"Schmidt","text":"It\u2019s a good environment as a proxy, or an analogue environment, for something like Mars because the other thing you really have at those elevations is extreme UV radiation."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"That prevents most microbial life from flourishing. Steve says the mountain supports a few lichens, which are born of symbiotic partnerships between fungi and cyanobacteria, but even these organisms likely grow very, very slowly. And when it comes to their role in decomposition, microbes need liquid water\u2014which is in short supply on Llullaillaco."},{"author":"Schmidt","text":"Usually bodies decay sort of from inside out because they stay moist inside, and you get all this stuff growing. But there\u2019s also things that are colonizing the surface as long as there\u2019s some water around, and, you know, if you bury bodies in just regular soil, there\u2019s plenty of moisture for them to decay\u2014to support the microbial growth that decays them."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"As for the moisture the children\u2019s bodies brought into the ground with them, the summit\u2019s extreme cold froze those liquids quickly enough to stop the microbial life within their guts. But if Llullaillaco is so extreme that it\u2019s literally an analogue for a Martian environment, how on Earth could the Inka have reached its summit centuries ago, without any modern climbing equipment? Diego and his colleagues recently decided to find out the hard way. [CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson]"},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Jaime Soriano, a local mountain guide of Indigenous heritage, joined Diego\u2019s colleague Christian Vitry, an archaeologist who was also part of the 1999 excavation, in donning some traditional Inka gear. They attempted to climb Llullaillaco themselves. It\u2019s not uncommon for archaeologists to carry out experiments that test ancient equipment or processes such as sailing roughly 1,000 miles on a Viking warship replica to probe various hypotheses about Norse seafaring. More recently, Greek marines put on Bronze Age suits of armor to test their mettle in combat. Diego says the idea of re-creating the Inka mountaineering experience was born many years ago, but the project only came to be in March 2023, after the research group secured funding. The team prepared for six months, commissioning Inka clothing and shoes from local artisans based on archaeological artifacts. Then the researchers traveled to the mountains to set up a base camp and acclimate. Finally they put on the replicas of 500-year-old mountaineering outfits and set off for Llullaillaco\u2019s summit."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"What we have found out during our recent experimental archaeology project in March 2023 is that the Inka probably only climbed mountains when there was good weather and no snow\u2014or just very little snow\u2014because when we finally found the Inka boots and poncho, they were very good, like today\u2019s mountaineering clothes, but they were not waterproof enough for the snow, you know? They could handle some rain but not the snow."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"While the archaeologists never reached the summit because of unusually heavy snow and a lightning storm, Diego says the experience was enriching, and they consider it a success. Their experiment suggests that the Inka\u2019s clothing may not have been totally winter-proof, but they were still surprisingly well-outfitted for the harsh conditions. The replica ponchos were made of tightly woven alpaca and vicu\u00f1a wool that blocked wind and rain and kept the researchers comfortable in both hot and cold temperatures. But the key to the Inka\u2019s mountaineering success, Diego says, was their multilayered high-altitude footwear. They combined wool with plant fibers and human hair, making for a sturdy construction that kept out cold and moisture. Researchers also believe it\u2019s possible these types of shoes possessed symbolic meaning, in part because of the use of human hair, which was thought to contain its source\u2019s knowledge and provide the wearer with protection. And the fact that the Inka managed to conquer mountains might have also helped them subsume other Andean cultures, which they did using multiple strategies, including conquest."},{"author":"Sberna","text":"The Inka were the first civilization that climb up to the summit of the [Andes] mountains. Pre-Inka [civilizations] worshipped the mountains from below\u2014from the foothills or valleys of mountains. But to install and legitimize their power when conquering other Andean culture, they decided to worship the [mountains] from the top. This is also why the capacocha ceremonies\u2014where they sacrificed the children\u2014are held on mountain summits."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"The Inka went to great lengths\u2014or in this case, great heights\u2014to make sure their revered sacrifices reached the realm of the apukuna. They often brought the carefully selected individuals to summits higher than three miles [about 5 kilometers]. In the modern day bringing those individuals down from the mountaintops has stoked fierce debate. Expedition leaders have argued that these remains are valuable in helping archaeologists understand the past. And Diego says that keeping the remains of the children of Llullayllaku at the museum protects them from grave robbers and mining on the mountain and shields them from the potential impacts of climate change on the summit\u2019s conditions. But some people believe the remains should not have been removed from the mountaintop, let alone displayed. While expedition leaders and museum staff have said they worked with local Indigenous communities during the excavation and exhibition, some Indigenous people strongly opposed both. In 1999 Kolla Community Los Airampos, a local Indigenous association, filed a complaint. The group\u2019s members consider themselves descendants of people who lived in the part of the Inka Empire that included Llullayllaku. They argued that they had not been consulted before the expedition and that the burial site is sacred to them. A federal attorney dismissed the complaint, saying the expedition had met its legal obligations\u2014a claim that\u2019s been disputed. The opposition didn\u2019t end there, however. In 2005 a group that included members of Indigenous communities from Argentina and other countries released a statement denouncing the expedition as, quote, \u201cdesecration and looting.\u201d They also said, \u201cWe condemn and denounce before world public opinion the attempted exhibition of these Children, human beings with the right to rest in peace and to respect for their privacy.\u201d In an article in the Guardian from that year, Rogelio Guanuco\u2014then the head of the Indigenous Association of the Argentine Republic\u2014was quoted as saying that the project was \u201ca violation of our loved ones.\u201d Those involved, he said, \u201cshould never have profaned the sanctuary, and they should not put our children on exhibition as if in a circus.\u201d The archaeology community has also raised ethical and legal concerns about the removal and display of the children\u2019s mummified remains. After the removal of the bodies and the opening of the exhibition at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, some archaeologists and museologists arranged meetings with Indigenous communities, collaborating on recommendations that encouraged respect for sacred sites and the inclusion of Indigenous people in heritage management. A declaration signed in 2005 specifically recommended against the display of human remains in museums. Diego says that high-altitude archaeology is practiced very differently today. Argentine archaeologists have decided not to carry out excavations at Indigenous high-altitude sanctuaries anymore nor bring down any mummified human remains they find in these sacred spaces in the future. They are now only doing surface examinations on Andean summits, looking for material evidence to help them better understand how the Inka connected sacred landscapes. Argentina has ratified International Labor Organization Convention 169, which says that Indigenous people should be consulted in matters that affect them, and has made some efforts to address Indigenous rights through constitutional reform. There have been cases in which human remains were returned to Indigenous groups in Argentina, and national legislation passed in recent decades has helped facilitate that process. The province of Salta, where the museum is located, isn\u2019t required to adhere to these federal laws, and Christian Vitry\u2014the archaeologist who was part of the 1999 expedition\u2014says that the specialized technology and personnel needed to preserve these remains in the communities calling for their return isn\u2019t currently available. But calls for restitution, including from Kolla groups like the community of Tolar Grande, have continued. And in 2022 the country\u2019s National Institute of Indigenous Affairs officially declared Llullaillaco an Indigenous sacred site. Mar\u00eda Patricia Ordo\u00f1ez Alvarez is a forensic anthropologist and archaeologist at the University San Francisco of Quito in Ecuador. She has been researching the collection and display of human remains from the Andes and the role of colonialism in those practices. Mar\u00eda Patricia says it\u2019s tricky to figure out which stakeholders have the right to make decisions about mummified remains in the Andes today, especially because groups of people in the region have moved around a lot in the time since these children were buried. Some archaeologists argue that it\u2019s challenging to link the children to one specific Indigenous group because of the nature of the qhapaqucha ceremony. They could have come from any geographic region that made up the vast Inka Empire, from parts of present-day Colombia to what is now Chile."},{"author":"Mar\u00eda Patricia Ordo\u00f1ez Alvarez","text":"When you discuss human remains, you\u2019re not discussing stuff in the present; you\u2019re discussing versions of that town in the past. You need to consider the actors in that particular community, that particular chronology and how those remains came to be where they are. The people that get to be involved in decision-making need to be from different places\u2014not just from the closest geographical position but rather people that could have a connection to those remains that are not necessarily close by, people that could feel represented by them."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Mar\u00eda Patricia says it\u2019s also crucial to remember that different peoples have and had very different relationships to the dead and that there isn't only one way to think about these issues."},{"author":"Ordo\u00f1ez Alvarez","text":"The concept itself of thinking about human remains being exhibited in terms of ethics is a complicated thing. We have a lot of other things to consider before just thinking of Western ethics in regards to the body."},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Another important question to keep in mind when it comes to exhibiting remains, Mar\u00eda Patricia says, is who benefits: Is it the Indigenous communities whose heritage is being displayed, or is it someone else?"},{"author":"Ordo\u00f1ez Alvarez","text":"Who\u2019s benefiting from them being exhibited, from the entrance fee, from all that?"},{"author":"Kar\u00e1th","text":"Mar\u00eda Patricia believes the ideal approach is to consider each decision about human remains as its own unique case\u2014a decision to be made in conversation with stakeholders and with an eye to the specific context involved rather than according to a one-size-fits-all rule. And most importantly, she says, respect for stakeholder communities and their heritage must govern the whole process. [CLIP: \u201cMoonlit Serenity,\u201d by Martin Landh] Today the Llullayllaku children still receive visitors, more than 500 years after their sacrifice, traveling in time from a mighty empire built above the clouds. They provide a window to the past, but they also remind us of the care we must take when gazing back through the lens of modernity. Just because these children have been immortalized doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll ever truly understand how they lived their lives\u2014or the significance of their deaths.

can reveal shocking similarities between modern-day humans and our most distant, ancient ancestors. But it just as often allows us awe-inspiring glimpses into feats our species accomplished without the aid of technologies we now take for granted. It can also force us to confront historical practices that shock our modern sensibilities\u2014and leave us grappling with thorny ethical questions. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to the final episode of our three-part Fascination series on extreme archaeology. If you\u2019re just tuning in, make sure to circle back to the episodes we posted last Friday and the Friday before that. You\u2019ll hear about everything from the surprising sophistication of prehistoric stargazing to the study of ingenious ancient fishing techniques that have persisted to this day. Back again with us is the award-winning documentary filmmaker and journalist Kata Kar\u00e1th. She\u2019s taking us on one more adventure\u2014this time to the top of a mountain with a climate so extreme it\u2019s practically alien\u2014to introduce us to archaeologists who study human sacrifice. Before we get started, a quick note about language: Quechua was the primary language spoken among the Inka, and its varieties are widely spoken today in the Andean regions where the Inka Empire extended. Throughout this episode, we use Quechua words where possible. The pronunciations you\u2019ll hear reflect the way the language is currently spoken by the descendants of the peoples who lived in the part of the Inka Empire that included what is now northern Argentina. We\u2019ve also provided the corresponding Spanish or English words and spellings in the transcript where appropriate. We want to make sure to mention, by the way, that the Quechua language family includes many different local varieties and that these are and were only some of the languages spoken among Indigenous communities in the Andes. You can check out this episode\u2019s transcript for more detailed notes on language. We\u2019d like to extend our thanks to Carlos Molina-Vital, a linguist and language teacher who specializes in Quechua, for his help in this area. Lastly, please be advised that this episode contains content that may disturb some listeners, including discussions of child sacrifices.

Its summit was the final resting place of Inka [in English: Inca] human sacrifices. By the way, while the mountain is known today as Llullaillaco, following Spanish conventions, its name at the time of the Inka was likely Llullayllaku. You will hear me use both words throughout this episode, depending on whether we\u2019re talking about modern or Inka times.

Researchers have estimated that the children\u2014a teenage girl, along with a young boy and girl\u2014had likely walked nearly 900 miles [more than 1,400 kilometers] by this time. They started from Qusqu in what is now Peru. Today that city is known in English as Cuzco. [\u201cQusqu\u201d is the official Southern Quechua spelling for the likely name of the city during the Inka Empire, though it is often written \u201cQosqo\u201d as a result of Spanish influence. Cuzco can also be spelled \u201cCusco.\u201d]. At the time Qusqu was the capital of Tawantinsuyu [in Spanish: Tahuantinsuyo], as the Inka called their empire. They likely stopped at various sacred sites during their monthslong pilgrimage. Then they were sacrificed as part of a ceremony called qhapaqucha [in Spanish: capacocha]. It\u2019s thought that these sacrifices happened for a number of different reasons: for instance, to provide offerings to the gods or to mark key events in the empire. Something to keep in mind here is that much of researchers\u2019 understanding of day-to-day life in the Inka Empire comes from accounts written by colonizers from Spain. Though some sources from the time period do include Inka voices, many don\u2019t. And it\u2019s important to consider the limitations and intentions behind these foreign accounts. For example, as one archaeologist has described, accounts of Inka spiritual life were often written by Catholic clerics, quote, \u201cin order to destroy the very practices they describe.\u201d We should note that these accounts aren\u2019t the only means of understanding the traditions of the Inka Empire and of the Andean peoples who became part of it. Elements of the Indigenous belief systems that predated the arrival of the Spanish are still alive in many Andean communities today. In 1999 an international team of high-altitude archaeologists unearthed the Llullayllaku children\u2019s highly intact mummified remains. This allowed for very detailed scientific analyses. It also fueled ongoing debates about excavating ancient sites and studying, displaying and storing ancient human remains, especially those with ties to modern-day Indigenous groups. Diego, by the way, is the director of the UNESCO Qhapaq \u00d1an, Andean Road System World Heritage site in Salta, Argentina. He used to work at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology in Salta, where the mummified Llullayllaku children are currently on display. Diego and his colleagues are trying to understand why the Inka worshipped mountains\u2014and how their special connection to the apukuna, or mountain deities, might have helped them establish the largest-ever empire in the Americas.

Located in the southern region of the Inka Empire, it was a wak'a, which refers to a sacred site or object. At the foothills of Llullayllaku laid a sort of base camp for imperial messengers and procession participants, including lodgings for travelers and a cemetery.

Who were they? Why were their lives, like those of so many others, sacrificed? Even before the Inka many Andean cultures considered the whole landscape\u2014including lakes, rivers and springs\u2014sacred, because it nurtured their crops and livestock. And with mountains rising along the horizon as far as the eye can see, their prominent role continues among many communities in the Andes today. The Inka believed that apukuna had power over water\u2014and as a result, the fertility of the land. Mountains were considered connection points that linked the Earth, the underworld and the sky. They served as homes to gods and spirits that controlled meteorological and geological phenomena.

Her small head was tilted over her right shoulder, with some of her tightly braided black hair gently falling over her closed eyes. You may remember I mentioned earlier that some believe the children should not be displayed; we'll talk more about that soon. All three children were buried in a shrine on a ceremonial platform just a few feet below Llullayllaku\u2019s summit. The child referred to as the Llullaillaco Boy [researchers generally refer to the Boy using the Spanish spelling of the mountain\u2019s name] was found tied up, his head resting over his knees in a fetal position, while the other girl\u2019s face and upper body were burned, suggesting she was struck by lightning after her death.

They could handle some rain but not the snow."]},{"begin":"1104.000","end":"1179.560","lines":["While the archaeologists never reached the summit because of unusually heavy snow and a lightning storm, Diego says the experience was enriching, and they consider it a success. Their experiment suggests that the Inka\u2019s clothing may not have been totally winter-proof, but they were still surprisingly well-outfitted for the harsh conditions. The replica ponchos were made of tightly woven alpaca and vicu\u00f1a wool that blocked wind and rain and kept the researchers comfortable in both hot and cold temperatures. But the key to the Inka\u2019s mountaineering success, Diego says, was their multilayered high-altitude footwear. They combined wool with plant fibers and human hair, making for a sturdy construction that kept out cold and moisture. Researchers also believe it\u2019s possible these types of shoes possessed symbolic meaning, in part because of the use of human hair, which was thought to contain its source\u2019s knowledge and provide the wearer with protection. And the fact that the Inka managed to conquer mountains might have also helped them subsume other Andean cultures, which they did using multiple strategies, including conquest."]},{"begin":"1179.560","end":"1211.000","lines":["The Inka were the first civilization that climb up to the summit of the [Andes] mountains. Pre-Inka [civilizations] worshipped the mountains from below\u2014from the foothills or valleys of mountains. But to install and legitimize their power when conquering other Andean culture, they decided to worship the [mountains] from the top. This is also why the capacocha ceremonies\u2014where they sacrificed the children\u2014are held on mountain summits."]},{"begin":"1211.000","end":"1558.800","lines":["The Inka went to great lengths\u2014or in this case, great heights\u2014to make sure their revered sacrifices reached the realm of the apukuna. They often brought the carefully selected individuals to summits higher than three miles [about 5 kilometers]. In the modern day bringing those individuals down from the mountaintops has stoked fierce debate. Expedition leaders have argued that these remains are valuable in helping archaeologists understand the past. And Diego says that keeping the remains of the children of Llullayllaku at the museum protects them from grave robbers and mining on the mountain and shields them from the potential impacts of climate change on the summit\u2019s conditions. But some people believe the remains should not have been removed from the mountaintop, let alone displayed. While expedition leaders and museum staff have said they worked with local Indigenous communities during the excavation and exhibition, some Indigenous people strongly opposed both. In 1999 Kolla Community Los Airampos, a local Indigenous association, filed a complaint. The group\u2019s members consider themselves descendants of people who lived in the part of the Inka Empire that included Llullayllaku. They argued that they had not been consulted before the expedition and that the burial site is sacred to them. A federal attorney dismissed the complaint, saying the expedition had met its legal obligations\u2014a claim that\u2019s been disputed. The opposition didn\u2019t end there, however. In 2005 a group that included members of Indigenous communities from Argentina and other countries released a statement denouncing the expedition as, quote, \u201cdesecration and looting.\u201d They also said, \u201cWe condemn and denounce before world public opinion the attempted exhibition of these Children, human beings with the right to rest in peace and to respect for their privacy.\u201d In an article in the Guardian from that year, Rogelio Guanuco\u2014then the head of the Indigenous Association of the Argentine Republic\u2014was quoted as saying that the project was \u201ca violation of our loved ones.\u201d Those involved, he said, \u201cshould never have profaned the sanctuary, and they should not put our children on exhibition as if in a circus.\u201d The archaeology community has also raised ethical and legal concerns about the removal and display of the children\u2019s mummified remains. After the removal of the bodies and the opening of the exhibition at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, some archaeologists and museologists arranged meetings with Indigenous communities, collaborating on recommendations that encouraged respect for sacred sites and the inclusion of Indigenous people in heritage management. A declaration signed in 2005 specifically recommended against the display of human remains in museums. Diego says that high-altitude archaeology is practiced very differently today. Argentine archaeologists have decided not to carry out excavations at Indigenous high-altitude sanctuaries anymore nor bring down any mummified human remains they find in these sacred spaces in the future. They are now only doing surface examinations on Andean summits, looking for material evidence to help them better understand how the Inka connected sacred landscapes. Argentina has ratified International Labor Organization Convention 169, which says that Indigenous people should be consulted in matters that affect them, and has made some efforts to address Indigenous rights through constitutional reform. There have been cases in which human remains were returned to Indigenous groups in Argentina, and national legislation passed in recent decades has helped facilitate that process. The province of Salta, where the museum is located, isn\u2019t required to adhere to these federal laws, and Christian Vitry\u2014the archaeologist who was part of the 1999 expedition\u2014says that the specialized technology and personnel needed to preserve these remains in the communities calling for their return isn\u2019t currently available. But calls for restitution, including from Kolla groups like the community of Tolar Grande, have continued. And in 2022 the country\u2019s National Institute of Indigenous Affairs officially declared Llullaillaco an Indigenous sacred site. Mar\u00eda Patricia Ordo\u00f1ez Alvarez is a forensic anthropologist and archaeologist at the University San Francisco of Quito in Ecuador. She has been researching the collection and display of human remains from the Andes and the role of colonialism in those practices. Mar\u00eda Patricia says it\u2019s tricky to figure out which stakeholders have the right to make decisions about mummified remains in the Andes today, especially because groups of people in the region have moved around a lot in the time since these children were buried. Some archaeologists argue that it\u2019s challenging to link the children to one specific Indigenous group because of the nature of the qhapaqucha ceremony. They could have come from any geographic region that made up the vast Inka Empire, from parts of present-day Colombia to what is now Chile."]},{"begin":"1558.800","end":"1589.360","lines":["When you discuss human remains, you\u2019re not discussing stuff in the present; you\u2019re discussing versions of that town in the past.

[CLIP: \u201cMoonlit Serenity,\u201d by Martin Landh] Today the Llullayllaku children still receive visitors, more than 500 years after their sacrifice, traveling in time from a mighty empire built above the clouds. They provide a window to the past, but they also remind us of the care we must take when gazing back through the lens of modernity. Just because these children have been immortalized doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll ever truly understand how they lived their lives\u2014or the significance of their deaths.
