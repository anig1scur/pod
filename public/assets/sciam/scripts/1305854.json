No, I\u2019m just looking around where everyone is. I have to do that once in a while. We had a bear almost walk into us the other day because we were, like, staring at a thaw slump. And we turn around, and we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that, that\u2019d be a grizzly bear there.\u201d"},{"author":"Bentley","text":"That\u2019s Steve Kokelj. And the reason he has to be on the lookout for grizzlies has everything to do with where we\u2019re standing right now."},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"We\u2019re, uh, we\u2019re in the Northwest Territories."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"That\u2019s the Northwest Territories in the high Canadian Arctic. Hey, I\u2019m Joc Bentley, and I\u2019m out here just north of the Arctic Circle to take you on a journey to the thawing edge of climate change. Over the next three episodes of Science, Quickly, we\u2019ll be mucking around in a part of the world that is warming faster than just about any other. Just a few years ago the tundra here was frozen solid, and now there\u2019s a massive hole with an area the size of more than nine football fields\u2014and growing. The ground is disappearing under our feet. I\u2019m trying not to get too close because there\u2019s a 20-meter drop-off. And I\u2019m gonna say meters because I\u2019m Canadian. Just getting that out of the way. This used to be a landscape shaped by ice. Now it\u2019s being completely transformed. [CLIP: Show music]"},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"But let\u2019s get back to Steve. He\u2019s here to study that now not-so-perma permafrost."},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"We\u2019re on the Peel Plateau."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"Steve works for the Northwest Territories Geological Survey. He has a constant entourage of students, and he\u2019s wearing an amazing Canadian lumberjack uniform."},{"author":"Kokelj: ","text":"Behind me is a type of permafrost landslide called a retrogressive thaw slump. That's a type of permafrost landslide that forms in areas where the permafrost contains a lot of ice."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"That thaw slump he\u2019s talking about? That\u2019s the hole. To picture it, you have to imagine what it would look like if a massive mound of earth just sorta turned into molasses one day and started flowing downhill. And the land that became molasses is really old."},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"So the ice that\u2019s melting behind us is a leftover of the, of the glaciation that covered most of Canada, and it\u2019s somewhere around [16,000] to 13,000 years old."},{"author":"Bentley (tape): ","text":"Does this mean we\u2019re still in an ice age?"},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"We are. We are still in an ice age. And the process of deglaciation, which is when the ice goes away, in the North, it hasn\u2019t ended yet. So we\u2019re still going through a period of deep glaciation here."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"This always blows my mind. We\u2019re still in an ice age. And that means Earth has a lot of room to get even hotter. Canada is seeing some of the fastest warming on the planet. And Steve says that has huge implications, especially for our frozen ground."},{"author":"Kokelj: ","text":"Most people don\u2019t, may not appreciate this, but half of Canada is affected by permafrost, right? So it\u2019s the northern half. But now that everything\u2019s changing, it\u2019s becoming a really, really important discipline to understand and improve the resilience of the Canadian North but also to understand global change issues related to the carbon being released from permafrost."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"Half of Canada. That\u2019s almost too large an area to really comprehend. And even when you\u2019re standing next to a thaw slump, it can still be tough to appreciate how big the changes are here. So we got in a chopper for a bird\u2019s-eye view. Keellie Stachniak, our pilot, took us for a tour of nearby slumps. So hold on and listen close because it\u2019s about to get real noisy. [CLIP: Helicopter taking off ambience]"},{"author":"Stachniak: ","text":"Should I take them to a slump?"},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"Yeah, same one as yesterday. Right beneath us, this debris tongue, it has infilled the whole valley, and it has accumulated about 35 meters."},{"author":"Bentley: ","text":"And just to put that into perspective, that\u2019s as high as a 10-story building."},{"author":"Kokelj: ","text":"Yeah, a lot of these streams were clearwater streams before, right? The thaw slumps are releasing all these sediments, and they\u2019re just changed, and they will be from now ..."},{"author":"Keellie: ","text":"Forever?"},{"author":"Kokelj: ","text":"For the foreseeable future, yeah. The materials that are coming out of the permafrost, it\u2019s not so much their makeup, it\u2019s the volume that are being put into the river systems here that are detrimental to the ecosystems."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"And Steve says this is just the beginning."},{"author":"Kokelj: ","text":"As the climate is warming and as summers are getting wetter, these types of disturbances are getting bigger. And in the past, under colder conditions, a thaw slump would grow over a period of a number of years and then stabilize. But as the climate\u2019s warming, they continue to grow and impact larger areas of land."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"This isn\u2019t just about land. There are Indigenous communities here that have been living off of this land for thousands of years. What\u2019s going to happen to them?"},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"So the people that live here are the Gwich\u2019in people, and they\u2019re very concerned about their landscape. They\u2019re concerned about the water in their lakes and streams. They\u2019re the people that have traditionally lived off of fish and caribou, of course. These types of disturbances, these types of landslides, deliver lots of sediment and other materials that have been locked into the permafrost into the streams, and that can affect the habitat in the streams and, and the health of the stream ecosystems."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"And the streams don\u2019t only get filled with sediment. Steve and his team have seen entire lakes disappear. Both the Gwich\u2019in and the Inuvialuit populations are facing some massive challenges. In order to better predict what exactly is going to happen to permafrost on a warming planet, Steve\u2019s team is running all kinds of experiments. On the team, permafrost scientist Alice Wilson is trying to figure out if snow cover slows permafrost thaw. In the darkness of the freezing arctic winter, she manipulates the amount of snow on different areas of tundra. Then, when summer arrives, they check how much of the top layer of permafrost has melted."},{"author":"Wilson: ","text":"Alright, so what we\u2019re doing right now is active layer, or thaw depth, measurements. So we use this graduated probe, where we have markings every 10 centimeters. So if we push it into the ground where we hit the bottom, you can kind of hear it sometimes. That\u2019s the base of, at this time of year, the active layer and shows you where the frozen front is, or permafrost."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"And then Alice does these kinds of measurements again but in a different area with the same setup."},{"author":"Wilson: ","text":"And so we can measure this to see how deep it is to permafrost in different areas. And then the other thing I can pull out is this. So this is a thermosphere chain, and so it has a logger on top recording all the information. And then each of these has a temperature sensor. So we know the temperatures over time at different depths."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"Alice drops the line down a PVC tube running deep beneath our feet."},{"author":"Wilson: ","text":"So this would be half a meter, one meter, meter and a half, two. And this one goes all the way down to three meters below the ground and into the permafrost."},{"author":"Bentley","text":"The researchers are hoping all of these data will help to better predict what exactly is going to happen to the North in the decades to come. Steve is a big believer in the importance of the research performed by his entire team."},{"author":"Kokelj","text":"We just haven\u2019t built our infrastructure, considering all these things, right? So it\u2019s kind of one of the important reasons to just study things, because if you don\u2019t make these observations, you can\u2019t kind of adapt your infrastructure to deal with this kind of stuff. Yeah, a lot of the challenges can\u2019t be overcome unless you do basic science, right?"},{"author":"Bentley","text":"Science, Quickly is produced by Jeffery DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper.
