Carey"],"category":["Arts"],"transcript":[{"author":"Teresa Carey: ","text":"This is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. I'm Teresa Carey. Every morning at five o\u2019clock, composer Walter Werzowa would sit down at his computer to anticipate a particular daily e-mail. It came from six time zones away, where a team had been working all night (or day, rather) to draft Beethoven\u2019s unfinished 10th Symphony\u2014almost two centuries after his death. The e-mail contained hundreds of variations, and Werzowa listened to them all."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"So by nine, 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, it\u2019s like\u00a0I\u2019m already in heaven."},{"author":"Carey","text":"Werzowa was listening for the perfect tune\u2014a sound that was unmistakably Beethoven. But the phrases he was listening to weren\u2019t composed by Beethoven. They were created by artificial intelligence\u2014a computer simulation of Beethoven\u2019s creative process."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"There were\u00a0hundreds of options, and some are better than others. But then there is that one which grabs you, and that was just a beautiful process."},{"author":"Carey","text":"Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the most renowned composers in Western music history. When he died in 1827, he left behind musical sketches and notes that hinted at a masterpiece. There was barely enough to make out a phrase, let alone a whole symphony. But that didn\u2019t stop people from trying. In 1988 musicologist Barry Cooper attempted. But he didn\u2019t get beyond the first movement. Beethoven\u2019s handwritten notes on the second and third movements are meager\u2014not enough to compose a symphony."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"A movement of a symphony can have up to 40,000 notes. And some of his themes were three bars, like 20 notes. It\u2019s very little information."},{"author":"Carey","text":"Werzowa and a group of music experts and computer scientists teamed up to use machine learning to create the symphony. Ahmed\u00a0Elgammal, the director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University, led the AI side of the team."},{"author":"Elgammal","text":"When you listen to music read by AI\u00a0to continue a theme of music, usually it\u2019s a very short few seconds, and then they start diverging and becoming boring and not interesting. They cannot really take that and compose a full movement of a symphony."},{"author":"Carey","text":"The team\u2019s first task was to teach the AI to think like Beethoven. To do that, they gave it Beethoven\u2019s complete works, his sketches\u00a0and notes. They taught it Beethoven's process\u2014like how he went from those iconic four notes to his entire Fifth Symphony. [CLIP: Notes from Symphony no. 5]"},{"author":"Carey","text":"Then they taught it to harmonize with a melody, compose a bridge between two sections\u00a0and assign instrumentation. With all that knowledge, the AI came as close to thinking like Beethoven as possible. But it still wasn\u2019t enough."},{"author":"Elgammal","text":"The way music generation using AI works is very similar to the way, when you write an e-mail, you find that the e-mail thread predicts what\u2019s the next word for you or what the rest of the sentence is for you."},{"author":"Carey","text":"But\u00a0let the computer predict your words long enough, and eventually, the text will sound like gibberish."},{"author":"Elgammal","text":"It doesn\u2019t really generate something that can continue for a long time and be consistent. So that was the main challenge in dealing with this project: How can you take a motif or a short phrase of music that Beethoven wrote in his sketch\u00a0and continue it into a segment of music?"},{"author":"Carey","text":"That\u2019s where Werzowa\u2019s daily e-mails came in. On those early mornings, he was selecting what he thought was Beethoven\u2019s best. And, piece by piece, the team built a symphony. Matthew Guzdial researches creativity and machine learning at the University of Alberta. He didn\u2019t work on the Beethoven project, but he says that AI is overhyped."},{"author":"Guzdial","text":"Modern AI, modern machine learning, is all about just taking small local patterns and replicating them. And it\u2019s up to a human to then take what the AI outputs and find the genius. The genius wasn\u2019t there. The genius wasn\u2019t in the AI. The genius was in the human who was doing the selection."},{"author":"Carey","text":"Elgammal wants to make the AI tool available to help other artists overcome writer\u2019s block or boost their performance. But both Elgammal and Werzowa say that the AI shouldn\u2019t replace the role of an artist. Instead\u00a0it should enhance their work and process."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"Like every tool, you can use a knife to kill somebody or to save somebody\u2019s life, like with a scalpel in a surgery. So it can go any way. If you look at the kids, like kids are born creative.\u00a0It\u2019s like everything is about being creative, creative and having fun. And somehow we\u2019re losing this."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"I think if we could sit back on a Saturday afternoon in our kitchen, and because maybe we\u2019re a little bit scared to make mistakes, ask the AI to help us to write us a sonata, song or whatever\u00a0in teamwork, life will be so much more beautiful."},{"author":"Carey","text":"The team released the 10th Symphony over the weekend. When asked who gets credit for writing it\u2014 Beethoven, the AI\u00a0or the team behind it\u2014Werzowa insists it is a collaborative effort. But, suspending disbelief for a moment, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine that we\u2019re listening to Beethoven once again."},{"author":"Werzowa","text":"I dare to say that nobody knows Beethoven\u00a0as well as the AI, did\u2014as well as the algorithm. I think music, when you hear it, when you feel it, when you close your eyes, it does something to your body. Close your eyes, sit back and be open for it, and I would love to hear what you felt after."},{"author":"Carey","text":"Thanks for listening.

It came from six time zones away, where a team had been working all night (or day, rather) to draft Beethoven\u2019s unfinished 10th Symphony\u2014almost two centuries after his death.

But then there is that one which grabs you, and that was just a beautiful process."]},{"begin":"83.080","end":"112.360","lines":["Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the most renowned composers in Western music history. When he died in 1827, he left behind musical sketches and notes that hinted at a masterpiece. There was barely enough to make out a phrase, let alone a whole symphony. But that didn\u2019t stop people from trying. In 1988 musicologist Barry Cooper attempted. But he didn\u2019t get beyond the first movement. Beethoven\u2019s handwritten notes on the second and third movements are meager\u2014not enough to compose a symphony."]},{"begin":"112.360","end":"124.240","lines":["A movement of a symphony can have up to 40,000 notes.

To do that, they gave it Beethoven\u2019s complete works, his sketches\u00a0and notes.
