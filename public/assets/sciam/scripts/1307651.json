Let\u2019s kick off the week by catching up on the latest science news. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Monday, July 22, topped the charts as the hottest day ever recorded on the planet. But that\u2019s not the worst part. Sunday, July 21, had actually just broken the same record. Monday turned out to be even hotter. Speaking of hellish weather that\u2019s all our fault, have you noticed how wacky rain has gotten? Like, speaking personally, it feels like we\u2019re seeing way more torrential downpours and unpredictable forecasts than we used to. [CLIP: Thunderstorm sounds] Scientists say they've found proof suggesting that this really is the case and that climate change is to blame. I know, shocking. What a plot twist. A study published last Thursday in Science found that daily global rainfall variability has been increasing since the 1900s to the tune of about 1.2 percent per decade. Rainfall variability is a measurement that tells you how uneven the quantity and pacing of our precipitation is. So, for example, if you have higher variability, you get droughts and downpours instead of a more chill assortment of sunny and rainy days. The researchers behind the study say our greenhouse gas emissions are largely to blame. As our atmosphere gets warmer it\u2019s also able to hold more moisture, which means it gets more humid\u2014and that water has to go somewhere. But while the world might be literally and figuratively on fire, it still manages to be really cool despite all of our best efforts. Last week researchers reported that unassuming mineral deposits found in the deep sea hold a cheeky little secret: they can produce oxygen in total darkness. I could probably nerd out about this for the rest of our airtime, but SciAm\u2019s own Allison Parshall is going to join us next month to tell us all about it, so I will save all the nerdery for then. In public health news, a study published last Thursday reports that the H5N1 virus, one of the viruses that causes bird flu, is being transmitted between mammals. Cornell University researchers say the data shows H5N1 has been passing from cow to cow, as well as from cows to cats and at least one unlucky raccoon. While there isn\u2019t yet any evidence of human-to-human transmission, the worry is that a virus that\u2019s getting better at spreading among mammals might eventually adapt to jumping between very specific mammals, meaning us. People. We\u2019re mammals. The official tally for human cases this year is at 10, but dairy herds in 13 states have experienced outbreaks and there\u2019s a lot of concern that this is going to get a lot worse. In other troubling epidemiology news, earlier this month, health officials announced that analysis of wastewater samples taken from Gaza in June revealed the presence of poliovirus. The World Health Organization has said there is a high risk the virus will spread within Gaza, and even internationally, without prompt intervention. The strain detected isn\u2019t wild poliovirus, but a strain known as vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. This strain comes from the weakened virus used in oral polio vaccines. The oral vaccine works well if immunization rates are high, which used to be the case in the Palestinian territory\u2014the WHO estimated almost 100 percent immunization coverage in 2022. But in rare circumstances, the weakened virus used in the vaccine can revert to a form that causes illness and even paralysis among the people it infects and be spread back through the population. Crowded living conditions, poor sanitation and, above all else, a decreased vaccination rate all make this more likely. And those conditions are present right now in Gaza. Immunization coverage has dropped significantly in the last few months as people have been displaced, and the majority of water and sanitation facilities in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023. United Nations agencies say that only 16 out of the strip\u2019s 36 hospitals are still considered partially functional. So it\u2019s not surprising that routine vaccinations have all but ground to a halt. That\u2019s left thousands of young children vulnerable to infection and has created the scenario where this vaccine-derived polio virus can spread. While no human cases of paralysis have been identified in Gaza so far, experts are worried this situation could escalate quickly. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201ca ceasefire is essential to allow an effective response.\u201d And this is a sentiment we\u2019re hearing from more and more healthcare providers. A letter from medical experts recently published in The Lancet estimated that the death toll in Gaza could end up being about 186,000, if not more. And that\u2019s even if Israel ended its military campaign immediately. That\u2019s not just counting people killed directly by artillery but also taking into account the cascading effects of potential outbreaks of illnesses like polio as well as the impacts of other factors, including mass displacement, loss of infrastructure and malnutrition. For one more piece of global health news, a few weeks ago I mentioned a really promising new study on a twice-a-year injection to prevent HIV. Now, while the medication\u2019s use for prevention is still being tested, Gilead Sciences already sells the injection as an HIV treatment in the U.S. The sticker price for a year of treatment is around $40,000. Last week researchers presented an analysis that suggests that the treatment could be profitable at a cost of roughly $100 or even less. Doctors Without Borders and other activist groups have called for Gilead to increase access by lowering its prices and allowing for generic production. They\u2019re arguing that the shot has the potential to end the global HIV epidemic, which would be incredible. And that\u2019s just too big of a deal to get tied up in profits. And again, these researchers aren\u2019t asking Gilead Sciences to take a loss. The medication could still be profitable at $100 per year, maybe even less as production ramped up, and right now it costs $40,000. Okay, so I know we\u2019ve talked about some extremely important, heavy world news today, so we\u2019ll wrap things up with a couple of stories that feel like really great Syfy channel original movie fodder. And by really great I mean terrible because that\u2019s what makes Syfy channel original movies great. [CLIP: Ian Ziering: \u201cI\u2019m here representing \u201cSharknado,\u201d this tiny little TV movie that has grown to a global storm.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Last Tuesday a study by researchers at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil reported that 13 sharks off the coast of Rio de Janeiro had cocaine in their muscle and liver tissues. The study authors say that sewage from human cocaine users and runoff from drug-producing labs is likely the culprit. They can\u2019t yet be sure how the cocaine impacts the health or behavior of these sharks, but I don\u2019t think that should stop Elizabeth Banks from taking the obvious inspo for a Cocaine Bear sequel, stat. [CLIP: Growl and water splash] Then last Wednesday in a study that\u2019s totally unrelated to cocaine sharks but like somehow feels kinda related to cocaine sharks, scientists showed that Komodo dragons have teeth coated with literal metal. The iron covers the tips and serrated edges of their gnarly teeth and helps keeps them sharp. Again, fantastic Syfy channel original movie fodder. Syfy: do you need help writing this script? Call my agent. [CLIP: Ian Ziering: \u201cI\u2019m here representing \u201cSharknado.\u201d\u201d]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Seriously, Syfy, call my agent. I can get you the script in, like, a day. [CLIP: Ian Ziering: \u201cSharknado.\u201d]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Here\u2019s a fun fact: lots of people believe that Komodo dragons, which are the world\u2019s largest living lizards, take down their prey with the power of poor oral hygiene. A few decades ago this biologist noticed that after animals got chomped by a Komodo they sometimes suffered these fatal infections. And he went on to present and cement the idea that they used bacteria in place of venom. I seriously remember learning this on, like, a nerdy little TV documentary in school as a kid. And I thought it was really awesome. Like, how wild to evolve to kill things with the power of your nasty teeth. Turns out\u2013thta\u2019s not true. Follow-up research showed that the animals actually have a pretty standard assortment of mouth microbes. But they also have venom glands packed with powerful toxins. These compounds that can cause excessive bleeding, make blood pressure plummet and keep wounds from clotting\u2014and, of course, iron-coated steak knives for teeth. [CLIP: Knife sharpening sound] That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to learn why the Olympics are so obsessed with sex.

Monday, listeners! Let\u2019s kick off the week by catching up on the latest science news. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Monday, July 22, topped the charts as the hottest day ever recorded on the planet. But that\u2019s not the worst part. Sunday, July 21, had actually just broken the same record. Monday turned out to be even hotter. Speaking of hellish weather that\u2019s all our fault, have you noticed how wacky rain has gotten? Like, speaking personally, it feels like we\u2019re seeing way more torrential downpours and unpredictable forecasts than we used to. [CLIP: Thunderstorm sounds] Scientists say they've found proof suggesting that this really is the case and that climate change is to blame. I know, shocking. What a plot twist. A study published last Thursday in Science found that daily global rainfall variability has been increasing since the 1900s to the tune of about 1.2 percent per decade. Rainfall variability is a measurement that tells you how uneven the quantity and pacing of our precipitation is. So, for example, if you have higher variability, you get droughts and downpours instead of a more chill assortment of sunny and rainy days. The researchers behind the study say our greenhouse gas emissions are largely to blame. As our atmosphere gets warmer it\u2019s also able to hold more moisture, which means it gets more humid\u2014and that water has to go somewhere. But while the world might be literally and figuratively on fire, it still manages to be really cool despite all of our best efforts. Last week researchers reported that unassuming mineral deposits found in the deep sea hold a cheeky little secret: they can produce oxygen in total darkness. I could probably nerd out about this for the rest of our airtime, but SciAm\u2019s own Allison Parshall is going to join us next month to tell us all about it, so I will save all the nerdery for then. In public health news, a study published last Thursday reports that the H5N1 virus, one of the viruses that causes bird flu, is being transmitted between mammals. Cornell University researchers say the data shows H5N1 has been passing from cow to cow, as well as from cows to cats and at least one unlucky raccoon. While there isn\u2019t yet any evidence of human-to-human transmission, the worry is that a virus that\u2019s getting better at spreading among mammals might eventually adapt to jumping between very specific mammals, meaning us. People. We\u2019re mammals. The official tally for human cases this year is at 10, but dairy herds in 13 states have experienced outbreaks and there\u2019s a lot of concern that this is going to get a lot worse. In other troubling epidemiology news, earlier this month, health officials announced that analysis of wastewater samples taken from Gaza in June revealed the presence of poliovirus. The World Health Organization has said there is a high risk the virus will spread within Gaza, and even internationally, without prompt intervention. The strain detected isn\u2019t wild poliovirus, but a strain known as vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. This strain comes from the weakened virus used in oral polio vaccines. The oral vaccine works well if immunization rates are high, which used to be the case in the Palestinian territory\u2014the WHO estimated almost 100 percent immunization coverage in 2022. But in rare circumstances, the weakened virus used in the vaccine can revert to a form that causes illness and even paralysis among the people it infects and be spread back through the population. Crowded living conditions, poor sanitation and, above all else, a decreased vaccination rate all make this more likely. And those conditions are present right now in Gaza. Immunization coverage has dropped significantly in the last few months as people have been displaced, and the majority of water and sanitation facilities in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023. United Nations agencies say that only 16 out of the strip\u2019s 36 hospitals are still considered partially functional. So it\u2019s not surprising that routine vaccinations have all but ground to a halt. That\u2019s left thousands of young children vulnerable to infection and has created the scenario where this vaccine-derived polio virus can spread. While no human cases of paralysis have been identified in Gaza so far, experts are worried this situation could escalate quickly. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201ca ceasefire is essential to allow an effective response.\u201d And this is a sentiment we\u2019re hearing from more and more healthcare providers. A letter from medical experts recently published in The Lancet estimated that the death toll in Gaza could end up being about 186,000, if not more. And that\u2019s even if Israel ended its military campaign immediately. That\u2019s not just counting people killed directly by artillery but also taking into account the cascading effects of potential outbreaks of illnesses like polio as well as the impacts of other factors, including mass displacement, loss of infrastructure and malnutrition. For one more piece of global health news, a few weeks ago I mentioned a really promising new study on a twice-a-year injection to prevent HIV. Now, while the medication\u2019s use for prevention is still being tested, Gilead Sciences already sells the injection as an HIV treatment in the U.S. The sticker price for a year of treatment is around $40,000. Last week researchers presented an analysis that suggests that the treatment could be profitable at a cost of roughly $100 or even less. Doctors Without Borders and other activist groups have called for Gilead to increase access by lowering its prices and allowing for generic production. They\u2019re arguing that the shot has the potential to end the global HIV epidemic, which would be incredible. And that\u2019s just too big of a deal to get tied up in profits. And again, these researchers aren\u2019t asking Gilead Sciences to take a loss. The medication could still be profitable at $100 per year, maybe even less as production ramped up, and right now it costs $40,000. Okay, so I know we\u2019ve talked about some extremely important, heavy world news today, so we\u2019ll wrap things up with a couple of stories that feel like really great Syfy channel original movie fodder. And by really great I mean terrible because that\u2019s what makes Syfy channel original movies great.

The study authors say that sewage from human cocaine users and runoff from drug-producing labs is likely the culprit. They can\u2019t yet be sure how the cocaine impacts the health or behavior of these sharks, but I don\u2019t think that should stop Elizabeth Banks from taking the obvious inspo for a Cocaine Bear sequel, stat. [CLIP: Growl and water splash] Then last Wednesday in a study that\u2019s totally unrelated to cocaine sharks but like somehow feels kinda related to cocaine sharks, scientists showed that Komodo dragons have teeth coated with literal metal. The iron covers the tips and serrated edges of their gnarly teeth and helps keeps them sharp. Again, fantastic Syfy channel original movie fodder. Syfy: do you need help writing this script?

A few decades ago this biologist noticed that after animals got chomped by a Komodo they sometimes suffered these fatal infections. And he went on to present and cement the idea that they used bacteria in place of venom. I seriously remember learning this on, like, a nerdy little TV documentary in school as a kid. And I thought it was really awesome. Like, how wild to evolve to kill things with the power of your nasty teeth. Turns out\u2013thta\u2019s not true. Follow-up research showed that the animals actually have a pretty standard assortment of mouth microbes. But they also have venom glands packed with powerful toxins. These compounds that can cause excessive bleeding, make blood pressure plummet and keep wounds from clotting\u2014and, of course, iron-coated steak knives for teeth.
