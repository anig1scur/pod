      "text": "Why did the lion take down a buffalo instead of a zebra? Because of the big-headed ants! I know, I know. Sounds like a riddle written by a preschooler tripping on Pixie Stix and David Attenborough DVDs. But it\u2019s actually the finding of a four-year collaborative study that showed that the arrival of a single species of invasive ant can have far-reaching effects that ripple across an entire African ecosystem. This tangled tale of interspecies intrigue started out as one might expect."

And I spent some time driving around Mpala Research Center and noticed that I didn't see any lions and I couldn't find lions and I'd hear them at night, and could never track them down\u2026. And I thought, well, this is hard."

      "author": "Palmer",

      "author": "Palmer",
      "text": "I was trying to remember how this idea came about that the reduction in tree cover might affect the way predators and prey interact, in particular lions. And \u2026 my recollection of it is very hazy, but it seems to involve\u2026having a few beers or gin and tonics."
    },

      "author": "Hopkin",

    },
    {
      "author": "Hopkin",
      "text": "After parsing those variables, the researchers concluded that the invasion of the big-headed ants left the acacias vulnerable to elephants. Which reduced tree cover and increased visibility. Which made zebras feel safe and made them harder for lions to catch. Now. Where do the buffalo come in?"

    {
      "author": "Hopkin",

      "author": "Palmer",
      "text": "It's a big-horned animal, twice as big as a zebra in terms of its body mass, and capable of inflicting some damage. You can go on to YouTube and see these amazing videos of, a buffalo attacking lions and flipping a 350 400 pound lion into the air. So they're just a more dangerous critter to attack."
    },
    {
      "author": "Hopkin",

      "text": "\u00a0I think it really exemplifies the sort of butterfly effect if you disturb one thing and there's all these different cascading consequences. And this paper highlights one chain of those cascading consequences, but there are so many others that we're finding or yet to find."

If there could be some way to kind of temporarily fence off areas in kind of a shifting mosaic around the landscape and give them a break, then we can keep the tree component of the savanna intact, because otherwise it's headed towards becoming a grassland."
