But in February\u2019s issue of Scientific American, we have a story about how they\u2019re colliding\u2014double whammy. Here to walk us through it is Kelsey Houston-Edwards. Kelsey is a mathematician and journalist. She formerly wrote and hosted the online show PBS Infinite Series. And she wrote this story, called \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Quantum Computers Threaten Today\u2019s Secrets. Here\u2019s How to Protect Them.\u201d Welcome to Science, Quickly, Kelsey."},{"author":"Kelsey Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Thank you. Thanks for having me."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Okay. Let\u2019s jump right into this mathematical quantum tension. How is quantum computing an issue for cryptography?"},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"So cryptography is the art of sending messages in a way that someone in between cannot read them\u2014that only the sender and receiver can read them. And there are essentially two different ways that this is done right now. And the first one is: A sender and receiver have the same key, and they use that key to lock and unlock a box. And the message is securely locked in the box in between. The problem with this type of cryptography is that the sender and receiver of the secret message need to have the same key beforehand."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"It doesn\u2019t work if the sender and receiver have never spoken before. So if you want to securely send your credit card information to maybe a clothing store online that you have no prior contact with, you don\u2019t have that secret key with them. You need to use something that\u2019s called public-key cryptography that\u2019s done entirely in the open. And it\u2019s always done between two parties with no prior communication. And that type of cryptography, at the heart of it, are very hard math problems, and quantum computers, if they were big enough, could solve these very hard math problems."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"If a quantum computer were to solve the very hard math problems that are at the heart of public-key cryptography, then the cryptography wouldn\u2019t work. It wouldn\u2019t be secure anymore. And we rely on it to send information in many, many, many contexts in the modern world."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"I think, on that point about using it to send information, you know, there\u2019s public-key cryptography. It\u2019s kind of an invisible system for most people. You don\u2019t think about it. You mentioned, you know, purchasing, making a purchase at an online clothing store. How deeply does encryption go? Like, what kinds of systems, like what kinds\u2014is it all data, basically?"},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Public-key cryptography is all over the place. It is in many, many, many systems that you use every single day. But I think most cryptographers would tell you that if cryptography is working well, you [don\u2019t]\u2014you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening behind the scenes. And if everything goes well, you will never know what is happening. It\u2019s only when cryptography fails that we really hear about it. So, for example, every time that you start an online transaction with your bank or anywhere else that\u2019s secure, many other kinds of video messaging services, things like that ..."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"every time you start it, they\u2019re going to do a public-key cryptography transaction, essentially, and they\u2019re going to exchange this private information in, in a public way. When you log in to your bank, it\u2019s also used to verify that information is coming from a reliable source. So when your phone updates, when it says, \u201cPlease download this new update,\u201d you want to make sure that that is really coming from Apple or whatever other company owns your phone. And the reason you can be sure that information is coming from a reliable source is public-key cryptography."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"So basically, it\u2019s baked into everything we do these days."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Yeah\u2014public-key cryptography that you\u2019re using many, many times a day."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"And so the prospect of losing that security\u2014you talked to a bunch of experts in the field about this. What does a world without this look like?"},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"I think most experts don\u2019t genuinely feel that we will have a world without this cryptography because quantum computers can break this type of cryptography but only larger quantum computers than we have right now. This is a problem about larger quantum computers in the future, and we know how to solve it. We actually have new kinds or alternative kinds\u2014actually, many of them are not new but alternative kinds of public-key cryptography that quantum computers cannot break, or at least we don\u2019t know how to break them with a quantum computer. So we know the solution to this problem."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"We know how to change our systems so that a quantum computer is not the threat that it is. But changing systems is very, very hard. There are a lot of people and institutions working to shift everything over, but it\u2019s a very long and slow process, and the hope is that it will happen before quantum computers can really break our cryptography."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":""},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"So on that, the sort of timeline for this\u2014for somebody who\u2019s sort of been around long enough, it reminds me of a thing that used to exist, which was this sort of specter of massive disruption and crash in the Y2K bug, which was a software issue in 2000 where all these old computers, which, you know, had been coded with the date as two digits, not four, in terms of the year to save space because, you know, computers were large but also not great with storage\u2014when that was supposed to roll over to the year 2000, there was an assumption that everything would sort of fall apart."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"That didn\u2019t happen, largely. But now we have this thing called \u201cY2Q\u201d. So could you tell us a little bit about what that is? Is it just kind of a fun way to talk about this new thing?"},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"So a information security company sort of came up with this idea of Y2Q\u2014\u201cyears to quantum\u201d\u2014as an analogy with Y2K. It\u2019s not as precise because we don\u2019t know when a quantum computer will come. We knew exactly when the year 2000 would come, but we don\u2019t know when there will be a large enough quantum computer to break cryptography. But they\u2019re trying to point out that we should be looking forward to that date, whenever it is, and we should be making all of our changes now before that."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"We should be concerned, especially because there\u2019s this uncertainty about when a large enough quantum computer will be built, and we should be making changes now. There\u2019s an additional reason to change cryptography now before the problem arises, and that\u2019s because a future quantum computer could retroactively decrypt messages that are sent now using standard cryptography of today\u2014the things that your computer is doing right now. That\u2019s not such a concern in many applications."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"For example, if you send your credit card number online..., if a quantum computer is invented or a large enough quantum computer is invented 20, 30 years from now, you probably have a different credit card number. So that\u2019s probably not a concern. But hospitals are storing medical records or sending medical records using this kind of cryptography. Governments are sending national security, very highly classified information, using this kind of cryptography. And that information you probably want to be secret for more than 20 or 30 years."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"So it\u2019s kind of alarming that in 20 or 30 years you could decrypt anything that\u2019s sent securely now. So we want to really change over these systems now to keep things secure for the long term."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Do you get a sense of where a computer like that might be built? Is it on the horizon? Are there candidates out there? Are there rogue governments building large quantum computers?"},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Yes, there is of course this possibility that someone, somewhere has the quantum computer to solve these problems. But that seems very, very unlikely. I think most experts feel that we would know about such a thing. When you ask experts in quantum computing, \u201cWhat will a future quantum computer look like, and what is the time line?\u201d their answers are quite varied and often include a lot of uncertainty. But I think that uncertainty is part of what makes cryptographers nervous."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Cryptographers need to prepare for quantum computers, and even the experts in quantum computing can\u2019t exactly tell you when it\u2019s coming and how. So that uncertainty makes the issue all the more important to address right now."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"It\u2019s a system that pretty much holds up our digital society as it exists, so probably reasonable\u2014all caution and worry there."},{"author":"Houston-Edwards: ","text":"Yeah, there is movement to change these things. So right now the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is standardizing new types of public-key cryptography, which will be implemented in the future in all systems. That may take a long time, but they will be implemented, and we hope that those new types of public-key cryptography cannot be broken by a standard computer or a quantum computer. But there\u2019s actually never a guarantee in cryptography. No one knows for sure that those are secure. So it\u2019s always a little bit of a cat and mouse game with cryptography."},{"author":"DelViscio","text":"Well, it\u2019s a really fascinating subject, and it seems incredibly important in the long term, maybe, but incredibly important to everything. So thank you for reporting on it. It\u2019s really fascinating.

and cryptography: those are two words that might strike fear in the minds of the uninitiated. But in February\u2019s issue of Scientific American, we have a story about how they\u2019re colliding\u2014double whammy. Here to walk us through it is Kelsey Houston-Edwards. Kelsey is a mathematician and journalist. She formerly wrote and hosted the online show PBS Infinite Series. And she wrote this story, called \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Quantum Computers Threaten Today\u2019s Secrets.

Thanks for having me."]},{"begin":"74.040","end":"97.880","lines":["Okay. Let\u2019s jump right into this mathematical quantum tension. How is quantum computing an issue for cryptography?"]},{"begin":"97.880","end":"137.520","lines":["So cryptography is the art of sending messages in a way that someone in between cannot read them\u2014that only the sender and receiver can read them. And there are essentially two different ways that this is done right now. And the first one is: A sender and receiver have the same key, and they use that key to lock and unlock a box. And the message is securely locked in the box in between. The problem with this type of cryptography is that the sender and receiver of the secret message need to have the same key beforehand."]},{"begin":"137.520","end":"175.120","lines":["It doesn\u2019t work if the sender and receiver have never spoken before. So if you want to securely send your credit card information to maybe a clothing store online that you have no prior contact with, you don\u2019t have that secret key with them. You need to use something that\u2019s called public-key cryptography that\u2019s done entirely in the open. And it\u2019s always done between two parties with no prior communication. And that type of cryptography, at the heart of it, are very hard math problems, and quantum computers, if they were big enough, could solve these very hard math problems."]},{"begin":"175.120","end":"192.840","lines":["If a quantum computer were to solve the very hard math problems that are at the heart of public-key cryptography, then the cryptography wouldn\u2019t work. It wouldn\u2019t be secure anymore. And we rely on it to send information in many, many, many contexts in the modern world."]},{"begin":"192.840","end":"213.120","lines":["I think, on that point about using it to send information, you know, there\u2019s public-key cryptography. It\u2019s kind of an invisible system for most people. You don\u2019t think about it. You mentioned, you know, purchasing, making a purchase at an online clothing store. How deeply does encryption go? Like, what kinds of systems, like what kinds\u2014is it all data, basically?"]},{"begin":"213.120","end":"247.520","lines":["Public-key cryptography is all over the place. It is in many, many, many systems that you use every single day. But I think most cryptographers would tell you that if cryptography is working well, you [don\u2019t]\u2014you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening behind the scenes. And if everything goes well, you will never know what is happening. It\u2019s only when cryptography fails that we really hear about it. So, for example, every time that you start an online transaction with your bank or anywhere else that\u2019s secure, many other kinds of video messaging services, things like that ..."]},{"begin":"247.520","end":"284.320","lines":["every time you start it, they\u2019re going to do a public-key cryptography transaction, essentially, and they\u2019re going to exchange this private information in, in a public way. When you log in to your bank, it\u2019s also used to verify that information is coming from a reliable source. So when your phone updates, when it says, \u201cPlease download this new update,\u201d you want to make sure that that is really coming from Apple or whatever other company owns your phone. And the reason you can be sure that information is coming from a reliable source is public-key cryptography."]},{"begin":"284.320","end":"288.200","lines":["So basically, it\u2019s baked into everything we do these days."]},{"begin":"288.200","end":"291.960","lines":["Yeah\u2014public-key cryptography that you\u2019re using many, many times a day."]},{"begin":"291.960","end":"301.600","lines":["And so the prospect of losing that security\u2014you talked to a bunch of experts in the field about this. What does a world without this look like?"]},{"begin":"301.600","end":"338.920","lines":["I think most experts don\u2019t genuinely feel that we will have a world without this cryptography because quantum computers can break this type of cryptography but only larger quantum computers than we have right now. This is a problem about larger quantum computers in the future, and we know how to solve it. We actually have new kinds or alternative kinds\u2014actually, many of them are not new but alternative kinds of public-key cryptography that quantum computers cannot break, or at least we don\u2019t know how to break them with a quantum computer. So we know the solution to this problem."]},{"begin":"338.920","end":"365.960","lines":["We know how to change our systems so that a quantum computer is not the threat that it is. But changing systems is very, very hard. There are a lot of people and institutions working to shift everything over, but it\u2019s a very long and slow process, and the hope is that it will happen before quantum computers can really break our cryptography."]},{"begin":"365.960","end":"365.960","lines":[""]},{"begin":"365.960","end":"402.960","lines":["So on that, the sort of timeline for this\u2014for somebody who\u2019s sort of been around long enough, it reminds me of a thing that used to exist, which was this sort of specter of massive disruption and crash in the Y2K bug, which was a software issue in 2000 where all these old computers, which, you know, had been coded with the date as two digits, not four, in terms of the year to save space because, you know, computers were large but also not great with storage\u2014when that was supposed to roll over to the year 2000, there was an assumption that everything would sort of fall apart."]},{"begin":"402.960","end":"415.880","lines":["That didn\u2019t happen, largely. But now we have this thing called \u201cY2Q\u201d. So could you tell us a little bit about what that is? Is it just kind of a fun way to talk about this new thing?"]},{"begin":"415.880","end":"451.800","lines":["So a information security company sort of came up with this idea of Y2Q\u2014\u201cyears to quantum\u201d\u2014as an analogy with Y2K. It\u2019s not as precise because we don\u2019t know when a quantum computer will come. We knew exactly when the year 2000 would come, but we don\u2019t know when there will be a large enough quantum computer to break cryptography. But they\u2019re trying to point out that we should be looking forward to that date, whenever it is, and we should be making all of our changes now before that."]},{"begin":"451.800","end":"486.600","lines":["We should be concerned, especially because there\u2019s this uncertainty about when a large enough quantum computer will be built, and we should be making changes now. There\u2019s an additional reason to change cryptography now before the problem arises, and that\u2019s because a future quantum computer could retroactively decrypt messages that are sent now using standard cryptography of today\u2014the things that your computer is doing right now. That\u2019s not such a concern in many applications."]},{"begin":"486.600","end":"523.560","lines":["For example, if you send your credit card number online..., if a quantum computer is invented or a large enough quantum computer is invented 20, 30 years from now, you probably have a different credit card number. So that\u2019s probably not a concern. But hospitals are storing medical records or sending medical records using this kind of cryptography. Governments are sending national security, very highly classified information, using this kind of cryptography. And that information you probably want to be secret for more than 20 or 30 years."]},{"begin":"523.560","end":"538.120","lines":["So it\u2019s kind of alarming that in 20 or 30 years you could decrypt anything that\u2019s sent securely now. So we want to really change over these systems now to keep things secure for the long term."]},{"begin":"538.120","end":"549.840","lines":["Do you get a sense of where a computer like that might be built? Is it on the horizon? Are there candidates out there? Are there rogue governments building large quantum computers?"]},{"begin":"549.840","end":"580.880","lines":["Yes, there is of course this possibility that someone, somewhere has the quantum computer to solve these problems. But that seems very, very unlikely. I think most experts feel that we would know about such a thing. When you ask experts in quantum computing, \u201cWhat will a future quantum computer look like, and what is the time line?\u201d their answers are quite varied and often include a lot of uncertainty. But I think that uncertainty is part of what makes cryptographers nervous."]},{"begin":"580.880","end":"595.160","lines":["Cryptographers need to prepare for quantum computers, and even the experts in quantum computing can\u2019t exactly tell you when it\u2019s coming and how. So that uncertainty makes the issue all the more important to address right now."]},{"begin":"595.160","end":"604.040","lines":["It\u2019s a system that pretty much holds up our digital society as it exists, so probably reasonable\u2014all caution and worry there."]},{"begin":"604.040","end":"640.160","lines":["Yeah, there is movement to change these things. So right now the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is standardizing new types of public-key cryptography, which will be implemented in the future in all systems. That may take a long time, but they will be implemented, and we hope that those new types of public-key cryptography cannot be broken by a standard computer or a quantum computer. But there\u2019s actually never a guarantee in cryptography. No one knows for sure that those are secure. So it\u2019s always a little bit of a cat and mouse game with cryptography."]},{"begin":"640.160","end":"671.160","lines":["Well, it\u2019s a really fascinating subject, and it seems incredibly important in the long term, maybe, but incredibly important to everything.
