      "text": "Hello fellow math nerds!\u00a0This is Tulika Bose, Senior Multimedia Editor at Scientific American. If you miss that famous Scientific American Martin Gardner column from the 1950\u2019s \u2014 never fear, we have some great mathematical content coming your way in the New Year. But for now, I\u2019d like to leave you with one of my favorite stories from this last year, hosted and edited by the incredibly talented Allison Parshall. It tracks the story of Cleo, a mysterious user on a Math stack exchange known for unleashing a series of rapid fire drive-by- answers on the forum without showing any of her work. Between 2013 and 2015 \u2014 the user named Cleo did this about 37 times, driving everyone with STEM degrees a little, well wild. But who was Cleo?\u00a0"

Now Ron has solved 2,954 math problems in his decade on Stack Exchange, but he\u2019s most famous for his answer to one integral in particular. On November 11, 2013, a Stack Exchange user asked a question: \u201cI need help with this integral: the integral from negative one to one of one over x times the square root of one plus x over one minus x times the natural log of 2x squared plus 2x plus one, all divided by 2x squared minus 2x plus one, dx.\u201d"

I\u2019ve enlisted his help to figure out what the heck I\u2019m looking at. As much as solving integrals has haunted my nightmares since Calc II, the idea of an integral is actually pretty simple. Picture a line on a graph. Now imagine taking a colored pencil and shading in the area beneath that line, down to the bottom axis of the graph. What we\u2019re trying to find is the area of this colored region. For a straight line, this is super easy\u2014it\u2019s basic geometry. But the more complicated and curvy and weird your line gets, the more difficult it is to figure out the area underneath it. Now the integral in the November 11, 2013, post\u2014that was difficult. The line on the graph looks like the spine of a long-necked dinosaur. The original poster tried using a few computer programs, but none of them could give what\u2019s called the \u201cclosed form\u201d of the answer\u2014that\u2019s a precise and concise solution. Five minutes after it was posted, someone commented: \u201cDo you have any reason to believe there is a closed form for that horrid-looking thing?\u201d"

It was a new account with only one previous answer. Cleo provided no notes, no proof, no explanation\u2014just a single hyperlink over the symbol for the golden ratio, which takes you to a definition of the golden ratio. Oof."

And I think just the bare answer to the question, by itself, doesn\u2019t have that much value. But it affected my determination to come up with a final solution for sure. And I spent the better part of a weekend doing it, writing it up. Took me about half a legal pad to work through it."

And her bio was different back then. And guess who she quotes? \u201c\u2018While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing.\u2019 \u2014Srinivasa Ramanujan\u201d Then Cleo wrote: \u201cRemember, you are not locked into a single axiom system.
