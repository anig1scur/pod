Does it ever bother you that you haven\u2019t actually been to space?\u201d And Fuller looked at him and said. \u201cMy God, man, where do you think we are?\u201d"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.]"},{"author":"Benson","text":"And my point is that, actually, this is not that different from the other work I\u2019ve been doing; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s at a different scale.

That\u2019s true [Laughs]. And we are talking about atomic physics because the electron microscope uses the electron and not the photon to look at subjects."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that. What makes a scanning electron microscope so different from [a] conventional lens-based microscope?"},{"author":"Benson","text":"It\u2019s quite different. It\u2019s\u2014first of all it takes up most of a room. It uses electrons instead of photons to look at the subjects, which allows for a far more detailed, nuanced, accurate look at extremely high magnifications of subjects."},{"author":"","text":"From a very young age I was aware of electron micro\u2014microscopy images, invariably presented as belonging to scientific research.

Art does not have to justify itself and prove things. Art is about sublimity\u2014it can be\u2014and about evoking wonder and about triggering aesthetic and emotional responses. And art is also, to quote something Brian Eno said recently\u2014I don\u2019t think he invented this, but it\u2019s an interesting point\u2014that art is, in some ways, how adults play."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"And furthermore, play is not wasting time\u2014play, in children, is about figuring out their place in the universe in a way, to simplify."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Benson","text":"And in my case this work is, in part, an extension of that impulse.

[Gestures at a page in Nanocosmos.]"},{"author":"Benson","text":"So it\u2019s lunar impact glass, and it was a piece of ejecta, as they call it, you know, from a macrometeorite impact millions of years ago the Apollo 16 astronauts just kind of casually noticed lying on the lunar surface when they were doing something else and raked up\u2014they had these rakes, sample rakes\u2014and just threw in their sample bag and brought back to Earth."},{"author":"","text":"Every single lunar image in the book\u2014there aren\u2019t that many ...

I very consciously wanted to make landscapes, lunar landscapes, on Earth. They look like Utah or Arizona slick rock country, you know? [Laughs.] They look very geological, and they are geological.

There\u2019s, like, a whole trend where\u2014or a thing where people, like, feel compelled to, like, lick rocks, and you got [Laughs] ..."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Oh, my God, these are Apollo samples. No chance would I, you know\u2014and, and, and in fact, I wasn\u2019t allowed to coat them. Because most samples you put in the electron microscope are coated with a molecule-thin layer of [a conductive material such as] platinum so that they don\u2019t charge."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"And that\u2019s complicated to explain. But you have an electron beam hitting the subject, you know, and if it\u2019s not grounded with, with that coating, it can charge, and, and so on.

But no, I did not lick them. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"[Laughs.] I mean ..."},{"author":"Benson","text":"It\u2019s a good question, though. [Laughs.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Many of the images, like the image of the weevil in a flowering plant\u2014I really like that one ..."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Become almost a world unto themselves ..."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Because they\u2019re taken so closely. They\u2019re obviously so beautiful, but is there also, like, a scientific benefit to taking pictures like these?"},{"author":"Benson","text":"Whether or not there\u2019s a scientific benefit is beyond me, but as I said earlier I am fascinated by frontiers, wherever they may be. I define a frontier as where, where what we know or think we know meets what we know we don\u2019t know ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"You know? And, and, and there\u2019s this sort of hazy zone in the sciences, where, where all of this research is taking place, and I am fascinated by that, but I\u2019m not a scientist ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Right."},{"author":"Benson","text":"I go there as an artist, looking for my kind of \u201cdiscovery.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"You know, with those images of insects in plants, you know, I, I did have the benefit of being able to speak to and actually get loans from entomologists ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"At the Museum of Nature. So I was asking things like, \u201cWell, what does that thing do?\u201d And then I would typically get an answer [such as], \u201cWell, we believe it\u2019s for this,\u201d and I realize I\u2019m at the frontier, you know?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Benson","text":"\u201cWe believe it may be for this,\u201d you know?

It\u2019s about\u2014the, the entire plant, let\u2019s check [Flips to another page], the entire plant is eight millimeters wide, so that\u2019s, you know, under a centimeter wide. And when I collected this thing with tweezers and put it in ethanol, I noticed that there was this weevil in it."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"And then they both, they both went in the ethanol. And so what you\u2019re seeing is this kind of\u2014I mean, very, very close to how it would look in actual nature, you know?"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"If someone actually paid attention to look."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Because\u2014I mean, because it\u2019s so small, it just feels like a thing that most of us would overlook."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, and also, who really looks at all those really tiny flowers? You just kind of trundle along, you know?

In fact, I think it\u2019s the single most complex mosaic I did in the whole book\u2014all of these are mosaic images, by the way; they\u2019re comprised of hundreds of individual scans. [Points to an image.] This is the one."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Yeah, so that is\u2014that\u2019s from a\u2014that\u2019s an Ontario plant and a foxglove aphid in it."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, yeah. [Points to a part of the image.] Right there."},{"author":"Benson","text":"Right there, yeah.

[Turns the page to a closer view and indicates the size of the frame with his hands.]"},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"You know? And then there\u2019s also a depth-of-field question. So, I mean, not to get all nuts and bolts on you here, but, you know, sometimes I had to do focus-stacking, get multiple scans of one part of the, of the subject in order to stack them in Photoshop and make sure everything was in focus, and then, you know, build a complex mosaic. So, yeah."},{"author":"","text":"And this is\u2014this has some elements of\u2014you know that famous painting with the tiger in the jungle [Laughs] ..."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Oh, yeah."},{"author":"Benson","text":"There\u2019s a little bit of that going on."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Art isn\u2019t prescriptive, but, like, what do you hope that people get from seeing these images?"},{"author":"Benson","text":"I don\u2019t know. I mean, you know, for example, those\u2014the weevil surrounded by flowering plants was consciously modeled after 16th- and 17th-century Dutch still-life painting, where you\u2019d see all the\u2014you could see all these flowers and insects, all in a perfect arrangement, and just kind of, you know, life in miniature."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Benson","text":"It\u2019s about triggering an aesthetic response.

And it\u2019s still in print."},{"author":"Pierre-Louis","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Benson","text":"It\u2019s incredible, you know?

It\u2019s, it\u2019s 300 microns wide, which means 0.3 millimeters; it\u2019s extremely small. But look at the complexity there. And, you know, when it was fully intact and not partly damaged, it had a whole shell of this kind of latticework going on there [gestures to an image in the book]. And, you know, there\u2014I write in the book about what all of these things are, we think, are doing, or at least to an extent: you know, what the\u2014those radiating spines are all about.
