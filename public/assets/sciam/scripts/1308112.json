Maybe you\u2019ve stumbled across this series on your TikTok \u201cFor You\u201d page."},{"author":"","text":"Here\u2019s another snippet to jog your memory."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Rutherford speaks in another TikTok video: \u201cUm, yes, hello, it\u2019s Spooky Lake Month, where we\u2019re doing 31 days of haunted hydrology.\u201d]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today we\u2019re diving into the topic of haunted hydrology, also known as spooky lakes. For the last few years artist and educator Geo Rutherford has used those enticing descriptors to get millions of TikTok viewers interested in learning about lakes, rivers and more. She\u2019s here to tell us more about her new book, Spooky Lakes: 25 Strange and Mysterious Lakes that Dot Our Planet, which Kirkus Reviews calls \u201ca chilling but thrilling primer for budding limnologists.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"Geo, thanks so much for coming to chat with us today."},{"author":"Geo Rutherford","text":"Yeah, thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So I feel like a lot of our listeners will probably know you already, but for those of them who don\u2019t, tell me a little bit about Spooky Lake Month."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Spooky Lake Month happens every October, from October 1 to October 31. It\u2019s essentially 31 days of spooky lakes and what we\u2019ve coined as \u201chaunted hydrology,\u201d both of which are kind of misnomers, as the audience knows. Despite how many comments I often get of, like, hauntings and supernatural events, people who follow Spooky Lake Month know that Spooky Lakes is actually about anything wet that is strange, unusual, is a result of natural phenomena, human interaction, environmental disasters, shipwrecks\u2014you know, just the weird things that the world has to offer as either a result of Mother Nature herself or us, as humans, getting involved and doing weird things. So that\u2019s kind of what Spooky [Lake] Month is."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, yeah, and it\u2019s been super popular, unsurprising; it\u2019s a great concept, a great hook. But before we get into that, I\u2019m curious: What got you interested in hydrology in the first place? It\u2019s definitely not on that, like, you know, short list of, five sciences that everybody picks from when they decide what to be obsessed with in elementary school, you know [laughs]?"},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Well, I\u2019ve always been a water baby, and so I\u2019ve always enjoyed and loved water. But I moved to Milwaukee to get my graduate degree, and when I did that, I was in Milwaukee for three years, about, you know, six blocks away from Lake Michigan and a beach called Bradford Beach, which is a wonderful, gross beach. And for my graduate degree, which is a master\u2019s of fine arts, I went to the beach every day for 90 days and just spent time with the water\u2014my whole graduate thesis was about the Great Lakes."},{"author":"","text":"And then the pandemic happened, right when I was in my, like, last year of grad school, and I started to share about the work I was doing\u2014the artwork I was doing, about the Great Lakes, which was very weird and went very viral because people were very confused. And then that kind of spiraled into making videos educating about the Great Lakes. And it was kind of\u2014I feel like it was some of the first educational content on the app ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"\u2019Cause now it\u2019s very common to have educational, you know, information on the app. But at this time it was kind of\u2014it was still new, and it just got traction. That was in, you know, August and September. And then in October of that year, on October 2, I had a\u2014compiled a weird list of lakes that I thought were strange. And kind of with no prior thought, I just said, \u201cIt\u2019s Spooky Lake Month now. We\u2019re gonna talk about spooky lakes.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"It\u2019s a terrible\u2014those videos are awful. We had a one-minute time limit. I was very chaotic. I, you know, made mistakes, and some of the videos are, you know, not\u2014they\u2019re just not very good. But that\u2019s kind of the nature of TikTok, is just making a mess of yourself and just keep going and see what happens and just get better and figure out where your niche is and where you belong and what you like to do. And so then when 2021 came around, we did, like, a very serious Spooky Lake Month. And that was probably the year that kind of really sparked it. Like, the first year was good, but the year that really started it all was in 2021."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What are some of your favorite examples of, you know, haunted hydrology?"},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Oh, yeah, man, I have, like, a top five favorite kind of examples that kind of embody Spooky Lake Month for what it is."},{"author":"","text":"Obviously, Lake Superior, which is here in North America, is a perfect example. There\u2019s, you know, over 300 shipwrecks. There\u2019s a huge\u2014I think 10,000 people have been estimated to have died in Lake Superior. And she doesn\u2019t, as Gordon Lightfoot liked to tell us, she doesn\u2019t give up her dead because the bottom of Lake Superior is incredibly deep and cold freshwater, so things don\u2019t decompose the way that they would in the ocean. Instead they kind of sit in stasis, and there\u2019s a chemical reaction called saponification. And it creates this substance called adipocere, which essentially coats the whole human body and kind of encases it in soap. And bodies can be hundreds of years old. There\u2019s, like, a body that they discovered in Switzerland with adipocere that was still intact, like, still\u2014all the flesh was kind of still attached to these, you know, bones.\u00a0"},{"author":"","text":"And so Lake Superior has some pretty famous shipwrecks and probably quite a few bodies that have experienced adipocere. But there\u2019s one in particular that\u2019s pretty famous; it\u2019s the Kamloops shipwreck. And there\u2019s a resident in the boiler room, a crew member who\u2019s still there today, and he floats around in the boiler room. It\u2019s been almost 100 years, I think, since that shipwreck occurred, and, you know, he still hangs out today."},{"author":"","text":"So that\u2019s kind of one of my favorite examples \u2019cause it kind of embodies that human element and the lake just doing weird things all by herself. But I like to talk about Lake Natron in Tanzania, which has this type of salt called the natron salts. And it\u2019s a result of Ol Doinyo Lengai, which is the volcano next to Lake Natron, having [a] very strange composition of lava. And that\u2019s kind of ended up in the lake. And as a result, the lake is, like, this very unique chemical composition that can \u201cmummify\u201d anything that falls into it. So any creatures that end up in this lake kind of get mummified. And the reason we say mummified is because the natron salts are the same type of salt, like, the Egyptians used to mummify themselves. So that\u2019s another great example, even though there are millions of flamingos that go to this lake every year, so it\u2019s kind of a lake of death that also spawns a unique life. And so it\u2019s [a] really interesting chemical makeup."},{"author":"","text":"And then I love to talk about Lake Baikal, which is in Siberia. It is the deepest lake in the world and the oldest lake in the world. And when I say deepest, I mean it is so deep: it is over a mile deep ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"It\u2019s so deep. And because of that, it\u2019s\u2014has its own ecosystem. So [about] 80 percent of the creatures in Lake Baikal are endemic to that lake, so they only exist there. We\u2019re talking about the Baikal nerpa seal, which scientists have no idea how this seal ended up in a freshwater lake\u2014literally landlocked, hundreds of miles from any ocean. We have no idea how it ended up there. And the golomyanka, which is this gooey little fish that lives deep in Lake Baikal. The rumor has it that when you pull it out of the water and lift it to the sky, it melts in the sunlight because it\u2019s, like, so translucent and, like, you know, fatty."},{"author":"","text":"So those are kind of some of the examples that I like to talk about when I talk about, like, strange lakes of the planet."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, very cool. And what has the reaction been from viewers, and has it surprised you at all?"},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"I\u2019m impressed that everybody is so invested in lakes. But to be fair, I don\u2019t think on the Internet we had really had a account or\u2014like, there wasn\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s tons of amazing YouTube videos, and there\u2019s amazing, you know, magazines and articles and all these things that kind of focus on the strange and the weird of the world, and those can include lakes, but I don\u2019t think that anybody had ever, like, specifically focused on lakes. So I think there was kind of an opening, a niche that was, like, just waiting to be mined. And I just happened to be the one that was like, \u201cHey, you know, lakes are weird.\u201d [Laughs]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"\u201cWater is weird.\u201d So\u2014and we haven\u2019t even really touched the ocean as much with these topics. I, obviously, \u2019cause haunted hydrology kind of\u2014I joke that it\u2019s, like, anything wet qualifies at this point ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"But the ocean is kind of an unexplored element of Spooky Lakes. I mostly stick to freshwater."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm. And I understand you have a new book out. Congrats on that ..."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Tell me a little bit about it."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a child of Spooky Lakes; it\u2019s called Spooky Lakes. And I actually got\u2014a literary agent reached out to me after the 2021 season of Spooky Lakes and said, \u201cHey, this sounds like it would be a fun book.\u201d And \u2019cause I\u2019m an artist, it was kind of this beautiful opportunity to combine all these things I love, right? I love water, I love freshwater, I love hydrology, I love painting, I love art, I love making, and I love spooky stuff. Like, I love horror movies, I love scary things, and I love the natural world just being spooky all by herself."},{"author":"","text":"So yeah, I got to write and illustrate this book. It\u2019s kind of\u2014it\u2019s technically a middle-school-age book, but I still include some pretty intense, like, hard topics: you know, what is base versus alkaline and, you know ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Things like that\u2014or acidic versus base, and what does alkaline mean, and things like that. So I include all these types of kind of complex topics that I think adults might not even really fully have thought about since their, you know, eighth-grade science class."},{"author":"","text":"So yeah, so it\u2019s a fun 96-page book with 25 strange and mysterious waters that dot our planet. And I did talk about three of them that are in the book\u2014so Lake Superior, Lake Baikal and Lake Natron are all in that book because they\u2019re kind of the quintessential, perfect example of a spooky lake."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What are you hoping that people take away from the book?"},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"I hope that they recognize that waters of our world are all containing secrets and that you never really know what resides beneath the surface. But at the same time, a lot of these lakes are suffering, and they\u2019re all kind of\u2014a lot of the ones that I talk about in the book, you know, \u201cToxic Lake\u201d in Romania, Lake Karachay in Russia, are lakes that are poisoned beyond recognition. And that\u2019s our doing. You know, the world didn\u2019t do that; the humans did. And so I think that\u2019s also kind of a clear through line in the book of, like, you know, what humans have done to these waters."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Geo, this was great. Thanks so much for coming on, and I hope some of our listeners will get their hands on your book."},{"author":"Rutherford","text":"Yeah, thank you so much for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode. Don\u2019t forget to check out Spooky Lakes: 25 Strange and Mysterious Lakes that Dot Our Planet, which you can find wherever books are sold."},{"author":"","text":"If you\u2019re looking for more spooky stuff to round out the Halloween season, you definitely won\u2019t want to miss next Wednesday\u2019s episode. We\u2019ll be talking to a researcher who focuses on morbid curiosity and fear. According to him, there are three distinct kinds of horror movie fans in the world. Tune in to find out which one you are. And in the meantime, we\u2019ll be back on Monday with our usual science news roundup."},{"author":"","text":"By the way, we\u2019re still looking for some listener submissions for our upcoming episode on the science of earworms. We\u2019re going to talk about why some songs seem perfectly designed to get stuck in our heads, and we\u2019d love to hear which earworms give you the most trouble. If you\u2019re up for the challenge, sing or hum a few bars into a voice memo and send it over to ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. Just make sure to tell us your name and where you\u2019re from.

There\u2019s, you know, over 300 shipwrecks. There\u2019s a huge\u2014I think 10,000 people have been estimated to have died in Lake Superior. And she doesn\u2019t, as Gordon Lightfoot liked to tell us, she doesn\u2019t give up her dead because the bottom of Lake Superior is incredibly deep and cold freshwater, so things don\u2019t decompose the way that they would in the ocean. Instead they kind of sit in stasis, and there\u2019s a chemical reaction called saponification. And it creates this substance called adipocere, which essentially coats the whole human body and kind of encases it in soap. And bodies can be hundreds of years old. There\u2019s, like, a body that they discovered in Switzerland with adipocere that was still intact, like, still\u2014all the flesh was kind of still attached to these, you know, bones."]},{"begin":"357.960","end":"381.360","lines":["And so Lake Superior has some pretty famous shipwrecks and probably quite a few bodies that have experienced adipocere. But there\u2019s one in particular that\u2019s pretty famous; it\u2019s the Kamloops shipwreck. And there\u2019s a resident in the boiler room, a crew member who\u2019s still there today, and he floats around in the boiler room. It\u2019s been almost 100 years, I think, since that shipwreck occurred, and, you know, he still hangs out today."]},{"begin":"381.360","end":"441.400","lines":["So that\u2019s kind of one of my favorite examples \u2019cause it kind of embodies that human element and the lake just doing weird things all by herself. But I like to talk about Lake Natron in Tanzania, which has this type of salt called the natron salts. And it\u2019s a result of Ol Doinyo Lengai, which is the volcano next to Lake Natron, having [a] very strange composition of lava. And that\u2019s kind of ended up in the lake. And as a result, the lake is, like, this very unique chemical composition that can \u201cmummify\u201d anything that falls into it. So any creatures that end up in this lake kind of get mummified. And the reason we say mummified is because the natron salts are the same type of salt, like, the Egyptians used to mummify themselves. So that\u2019s another great example, even though there are millions of flamingos that go to this lake every year, so it\u2019s kind of a lake of death that also spawns a unique life.

We have no idea how it ended up there. And the golomyanka, which is this gooey little fish that lives deep in Lake Baikal.
