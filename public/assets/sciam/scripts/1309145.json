These outbreaks are occurring even though measles was technically eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. Here to explain what that means\u2014and why that status could be at risk\u2014is Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American."},{"author":"","text":"Lauren, thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Lauren Young","text":"No, thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So to refresh our listeners\u2019 memories could you give us a brief overview of the current measles outbreaks of concern?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Sure, so the situation continues to worsen in the U.S.; measles cases are continuing to rise. The current case count as of May 1 of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s] report says 935 confirmed cases, which is growing at a pretty alarming rate. The initial outbreak began in West Texas, and now it\u2019s in 29 states, and we\u2019re also seeing cases and outbreak spread in Mexico and Canada."},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s important to note, too, that nearly 70 percent of the confirmed cases [in the U.S.] have been in younger people, ages 19 and below, and a large proportion of those cases are in unvaccinated people ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Young","text":"Which\u2014and this is a concern \u2019cause measles is very highly contagious. It\u2019s known for, you know, spreading via cough. It\u2019s also known for creating a rash, which is pretty uncomfortable, coughing and runny nose, but it could also cause severe complications: it could open up people to pneumonia, organ failure and death. There\u2019ve been three people who\u2019ve died so far from these outbreaks, one adult and two children, and all three have been unvaccinated ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Young","text":"So it\u2019s definitely concerning. I know a lot of public health experts are keeping an eye on this and trying to understand, too, the public health response that\u2019s going on."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, and just how abnormal is this compared to recent years?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Right, so every year we do see cases of measles, and this often happens primarily due to travel\u2014so when someone goes abroad to a place where measles is more common, they\u2019ll come back and reintroduce, you know, some cases. But they\u2019re usually relatively contained. What we\u2019re seeing now is the highest number of cases since 2019, when we had a pretty large outbreak that started in New York."},{"author":"","text":"But, you know, experts are pretty much in agreement that the case counts right now probably are also underestimations. When these cases started in West Texas, for instance, it was highly concentrated in Gaines County, which is known to have a pretty high population of homeschool children. And so it\u2019s hard to understand fully the vaccination rates in kids, since, again, these outbreaks and the, the cases are highly concentrated in children, so yeah, public health experts are definitely keeping an eye on this and are concerned about what\u2019s gonna happen in the next few months, yeah."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I think a lot of folks get confused about the statement that we hear a lot lately that measles has been \u201celiminated\u201d in the United States. Could you explain what that status means and how we got it?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Sure, so a disease gets \u201celimination\u201d status when its incidence is reduced to zero in a specific region for a set time frame. It\u2019s a little bit of a jargony, like, public health status thing, but the CDC and the World Health Organization define the status for measles as a period of 12 months with zero endemic cases, so that means there needs to be no continuous transmission of the disease over a 12-month period of time\u2014so you can\u2019t link one case from another case."},{"author":"","text":"The United States achieved its elimination status of measles in 2000, and we\u2019ve been able to keep that status primarily through prevention measures, particularly through vaccination. And, as we know, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, which is how you get vaccinated for measles, is pretty highly effective and very safe."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, do experts think that that elimination status is at risk right now?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Yeah, so there were a few prominent experts in the field of vaccine science who spoke out about this recently. Peter Marks, who was a former [Food and Drug Administration] official and he\u2019s a prominent vaccine expert,said he\u2019s worried that we\u2019re on the way to losing this status. Also Katherine Wells, who is the public health director in Texas, said in March during a news briefing that she\u2019s anticipating that this outbreak could go a year long ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Young","text":"So that would definitely be pushing into that 12-month window for achieving that elimination status."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"As you mentioned, this isn\u2019t our first big outbreak since 2000, so what factors are coming together to put our elimination status at risk after, you know, 25 years of success?"},{"author":"Young","text":"Yeah, so there\u2019s a few things that seem to be, you know, folding into play based off of what I\u2019m just hearing from the experts that I\u2019ve talked to. One, for sure, is: we\u2019ve been seeing kind of this steady decline in vaccination rates, specifically in kids but, you know, just nationally as well, ever since the pandemic. A big part of that was: during the pandemic itself a lot of children missed their well appointments, where they would get their routine vaccinations. We did see, you know, some increase from that, but there\u2019s other things at play."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s been a lot of anti-vaccine rhetoric that\u2019s been going on that\u2019s causing some of that increase to stagnate slightly, and, you know, experts are really highly concerned. We also have, you know, some public health officials in office right now who have a history of endorsing anti-vaccine rhetoric and are also endorsing studies to reevaluate things like autism and vaccines and that connection there."},{"author":"","text":"So there\u2019s just this heightened concern around vaccines. And when we see things like a decline in vaccination rates it\u2019s very important for a disease like measles because it is so highly contagious. And for something like measles we need to see, as some experts have explained to me, very highly uniform vaccine coverage\u2014in other words, high \u201cherd immunity,\u201d which is basically the level of either natural immunity or vaccination immunity you need to have in order to stop the spread of disease. So for measles you need about a 95 percent vaccination rate, and any sort of, you know, even slight decline in that can cause these severe outbreaks."},{"author":"","text":"So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here, where, you know, we have a small pocketed community that had a lower vaccination rate and is, you know, spurring this particular outbreak. But we\u2019re seeing that also, too, in other places in the country where there might be even just a small dip in vaccination and it causes a disease to spread. And measles is kind of, as some experts have said, canary in a coal mine for vaccine-preventable diseases because it is so highly contagious, but if we continue to see this overall decrease in vaccinations for things like, you know, other eliminated diseases\u2014like polio, for instance\u2014that\u2019s also a little bit of concern for several experts."},{"author":"","text":"We did a whole story about this\u2014Tara Haelle, one of our contributors, did a really deep dive on what that exactly would look like. So this is on the forefront of a lot of people\u2019s minds, just the general interplay between vaccine recommendations from public health officials and also how that\u2019s playing out from, you know, past historical trends. It\u2019s all kind of coalescing together."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, what do public health experts think we can do to keep measles from becoming endemic again?"},{"author":"Young","text":"It seems maybe like a little bit beating a dead horse, but getting vaccinated, you know, I think is still an important thing to do. Listening to trusted health practitioners about treatment. Being active about, you know, going to the hospital or going and getting treatment if you\u2019re seeing any signs or symptoms\u2014which, again, include the rash, coughing, and the runny nose and watery eyes."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Lauren, thank you so much for coming on. Unfortunately, I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be the last time we talked to you about measles, but we really appreciate it."},{"author":"Young","text":"No, thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

And, as we know, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, which is how you get vaccinated for measles, is pretty highly effective and very safe."]},{"begin":"316.320","end":"320.520","lines":["Yeah, do experts think that that elimination status is at risk right now?"]},{"begin":"320.520","end":"342.720","lines":["Yeah, so there were a few prominent experts in the field of vaccine science who spoke out about this recently. Peter Marks, who was a former [Food and Drug Administration] official and he\u2019s a prominent vaccine expert,said he\u2019s worried that we\u2019re on the way to losing this status. Also Katherine Wells, who is the public health director in Texas, said in March during a news briefing that she\u2019s anticipating that this outbreak could go a year long ..."]},{"begin":"342.720","end":"343.160","lines":["Mm."]},{"begin":"343.160","end":"348.520","lines":["So that would definitely be pushing into that 12-month window for achieving that elimination status."]},{"begin":"348.520","end":"359.480","lines":["As you mentioned, this isn\u2019t our first big outbreak since 2000, so what factors are coming together to put our elimination status at risk after, you know, 25 years of success?"]},{"begin":"359.480","end":"390.520","lines":["Yeah, so there\u2019s a few things that seem to be, you know, folding into play based off of what I\u2019m just hearing from the experts that I\u2019ve talked to. One, for sure, is: we\u2019ve been seeing kind of this steady decline in vaccination rates, specifically in kids but, you know, just nationally as well, ever since the pandemic. A big part of that was: during the pandemic itself a lot of children missed their well appointments, where they would get their routine vaccinations. We did see, you know, some increase from that, but there\u2019s other things at play."]},{"begin":"390.520","end":"415.080","lines":["There\u2019s been a lot of anti-vaccine rhetoric that\u2019s been going on that\u2019s causing some of that increase to stagnate slightly, and, you know, experts are really highly concerned. We also have, you know, some public health officials in office right now who have a history of endorsing anti-vaccine rhetoric and are also endorsing studies to reevaluate things like autism and vaccines and that connection there."]},{"begin":"415.080","end":"452.560","lines":["So there\u2019s just this heightened concern around vaccines. And when we see things like a decline in vaccination rates it\u2019s very important for a disease like measles because it is so highly contagious. And for something like measles we need to see, as some experts have explained to me, very highly uniform vaccine coverage\u2014in other words, high \u201cherd immunity,\u201d which is basically the level of either natural immunity or vaccination immunity you need to have in order to stop the spread of disease. So for measles you need about a 95 percent vaccination rate, and any sort of, you know, even slight decline in that can cause these severe outbreaks."]},{"begin":"452.560","end":"488.720","lines":["So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here, where, you know, we have a small pocketed community that had a lower vaccination rate and is, you know, spurring this particular outbreak. But we\u2019re seeing that also, too, in other places in the country where there might be even just a small dip in vaccination and it causes a disease to spread. And measles is kind of, as some experts have said, canary in a coal mine for vaccine-preventable diseases because it is so highly contagious, but if we continue to see this overall decrease in vaccinations for things like, you know, other eliminated diseases\u2014like polio, for instance\u2014that\u2019s also a little bit of concern for several experts."]},{"begin":"488.720","end":"509.200","lines":["We did a whole story about this\u2014Tara Haelle, one of our contributors, did a really deep dive on what that exactly would look like. So this is on the forefront of a lot of people\u2019s minds, just the general interplay between vaccine recommendations from public health officials and also how that\u2019s playing out from, you know, past historical trends. It\u2019s all kind of coalescing together."]},{"begin":"509.200","end":"514.840","lines":["Yeah, what do public health experts think we can do to keep measles from becoming endemic again?"]},{"begin":"514.840","end":"534.840","lines":["It seems maybe like a little bit beating a dead horse, but getting vaccinated, you know, I think is still an important thing to do. Listening to trusted health practitioners about treatment.
