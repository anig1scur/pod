And I did stick with it. In high school I made a song entirely with homemade instruments that involved water, including hitting half-full wine glasses with chopsticks and water drumming\u2014you know, when you get in the bathtub in a swimsuit and have your mom hold a microphone while you smack the surface of the water?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[CLIP: Sample of Allison\u2019s weird water composition from high school in the background] Water drumming.\u00a0 But no amount of amateur water drumming arranged in GarageBand could be even half as weird\u2014and fun\u2014as some of the music that AI can make these days. [CLIP: Theme music] Welcome back to Science, Quickly. I\u2019m Allison Parshall. This is part two of our three-part series on music-making artificial intelligence. In the first episode, we met the winner of the 2022 AI Song Contest, who used machine learning to bring Western instruments into the world of Thai tuning."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Today we\u2019re diving way deeper into that technology. And\u2014as it turns out\u2014scientists are on the cusp of something gigantic in music AI."},{"author":"Shelly Palmer: ","text":"The MusicLM product\u2014it's so impressive. What it is is so impressive\u2026. the amount of things that have to be true for this to be what it is are unbelievable\u2014like, unbelievable.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That was Shelly Palmer, a composer, and he\u2019s talking about MusicLM, a music-making AI model published in January by Google Research. The \u201cLM\u201d in its name stands for \u201clanguage model\u201d because it harnesses some of the advances in AI language processing to create music. And boy, does it create music. You might remember Dall-E 2, that AI tool that can turn your weird text prompts into surreal images totally unconstrained by reality. This is like that\u2014except it spits out music. [CLIP: Soundscape of digital music from MusicLM samples]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"To understand why this is so cool, we\u2019re going to have to step back in time a bit. The desire to outsource some of the creative process to algorithms is old, older than AI, even older than computers."},{"author":"Akito van Troyer","text":"People were definitely already thinking about algorithmic music before computers existed, right?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s Akito van Troyer, a professor at the Berklee College of Music who teaches a class on machine learning and music."},{"author":"Van Troyer: ","text":"For example, Mozart composed a piece of music he called \u201cDice Music.\u201d What he did was to compose a melodic motif, a bunch of them."},{"author":"Van Troyer: ","text":"And he will choose which motifs to stitch together based on throwing a dice\u2026 [CLIP: Sample from one possible playing of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel version #1] \u2026and that\u2019s algorithmic music because you\u2019re determining the result of the music based on the throwing of the dice kind of situation, right?\u00a0 [CLIP: Sample from one possible playing of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel version #2] And then computers just came to be the ideal platform to experiment on. As soon as computers were accessible to musicians they were already using it."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Brad Garton was one of those computer musicians back in the early days, when computers were the size of rooms and whatnot. He\u2019s a composer and former director of Columbia University\u2019s Computer Music Center."},{"author":"Garton","text":"I learned how to program on punch cards. People don\u2019t even remember what those are. We\u2019d type in these lines painstakingly by hand and then submit them to the mainframe computer\u2014an IBM 3081\u2014on campus. I think it had two [kilobytes] of RAM, or something. [laughs] And we would then have to wait for two hours. And then, uh, we would have to wait for two hours. We\u2019d get a special tape; we\u2019d take it over to the computer lab, where they had the special hardware to turn it into sound."},{"author":"Garton","text":"Then you\u2019d realize you\u2019d mistyped one parameter, and your masterpiece sounded like this [sound of a click]. And that was it[laughs].\u00a0 And it was really fun\u2014I mean, because a lot of times, I wouldn\u2019t quite know what I would get. But I\u2019d listen to it and go, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s pretty cool. It\u2019s got a better sense of rhythm than I do!\u201d\u00a0[laughs]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Eventually, making computer music became easier and quicker. AI musicians moved from punch cards to MIDI files, a digital file format that contains sequences of musical notes in text form. MIDI stands for \u201cmusical instrument digital interface,\u201d and it\u2019s a pretty limited way to represent music. It strips out the richness and expressivity of a performance since it includes just the names of notes and when they\u2019re played. It can turn a song that sounds like this ... [CLIP: A recording of a grand piano playing an expressive piece] \u2026 into this."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[CLIP: A MIDI piano version of the same piece, sounding robotic and unexpressive] So MIDI is restrictive, but it worked well enough with these early AI models. What you would do was: you\u2019d give a model the text versions of a whole bunch of music, and it would pick up patterns to generate text versions of new music, which could be converted into sound using programs like, say, GarageBand. Up until the past few years, this was still the most efficient way of making AI-generated music."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"One relatively recent model called MuseNet was made public in 2019 by OpenAI, the makers of the now famous chatbot ChatGPT. With Musenet, you could make unlikely mashups\u2014such as this example. [CLIP: MuseNet improvises from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s Rondo alla Turca in the style of Lady Gaga]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"You can kind of hear how robotic it sounds\u2014that\u2019s because it\u2019s using MIDI. But soon after MuseNet was published, the OpenAI team got to work changing that. The researchers\u2019 next project was an AI composer that could actually work with raw audio files, not just their text-based approximations."},{"author":"Christine McLeavey","text":"In theory, raw audio can sound like anything. It doesn\u2019t even have to be only music. You could literally do any sound effects you can imagine. [CLIP: Saw cranes at M\u00e5lsj\u00f6n in Kristdala, Sweden]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s Christine McLeavey, a pianist\u2014and one of the architects of OpenAI\u2019s music models."},{"author":"McLeavey","text":"If you think of a good quality recording, it\u2019s maybe, like, 44 kilohertz, which is, like, 44,000 samples per second. It\u2019s a lot\u2014a lot\u2014of information, and you have to get each one of those numbers correct. There\u2019s just so many ways you can get off by a little bit."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"In order to work with these massive files, engineers like McLeavey need to compress all that information down into a small space. Their approach isn\u2019t that different from how you compress a file on your computer. Basically, they break up the audio into small pieces they call \u201ctokens,\u201d like breaking a sentence into words. Each token contains important information about a portion of the audio waveform compressed in a smaller amount of space."},{"author":"McLeavey","text":"If you\u2019re a teacher who\u2019s going to give a lecture, usually you wouldn\u2019t write down literally every single word you're going to say....you have a sort of higher-level plan of what\u2019s going to happen. And in the same way, we\u2019re kind of doing that to the music. We\u2019re trying to generate this, like, higher-level representation first, and then, from that, then generate the, the sort of fleshed-out version, where we get the full sound that we can listen to."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Honestly, this part of the technology is like magic to me. But it works. The resulting program, called Jukebox, came together through a few months of trial and error. This is the algorithm in August 2019, trying its best to make a pop song. [CLIP: Jukebox sample entitled \u201cHints of Pop\u201d] Then, one month later, after being trained on a wider diversity of music, it could do an okay-ish Bob Marley impression."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[CLIP: Jukebox sample in the style of Bob Marley] A few months after that, the researchers improved the quality of the audio and prompted the model with the first 12 seconds of \u201cDespacito,\u201d letting it run wild with the rest. [CLIP: Jukebox sample: \u201cDespacito\u201d continuation]"},{"author":"McLeavey","text":"\u201cWorking with raw audio, the sky is the limit in terms of what you can create. Literally, you could say, \u201cWhat if I take this whale sound \u2026 [CLIP: whale call] \u2026 and blend it with, I don\u2019t know, the Beatles?\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Flash forward, now, this year: Google publishes MusicLM, that new music language model, where you can probably type, \u201cWhale song blended with the Beatles\u201d into a text box and get a really unique piece of music out of it. I\u2019d do just that and play it for you, but unfortunately, MusicLM is not available to the public yet. Still, the samples that I got from its publication were enough to set my head spinning."},{"author":"Palmer","text":"The MusicLM product is early days."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s Shelly Palmer again."},{"author":"Palmer","text":"When it\u2019s right, it\u2019s kinda right. When it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s really wrong."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I asked Shelly to walk me through some of the highlights and lowlights of the samples."},{"author":"Palmer","text":"Main soundtrack of an arcade game.... [CLIP: MusicLM sample: arcade game]"},{"author":"Palmer","text":"Fast-paced, upbeat, catchy guitar riff. That\u2019s pretty much spot on for what they say it\u2019s supposed to be. Rising synth playing an arpeggio with a lot of reverb is backed by pads ... Let\u2019s listen.\u00a0 [CLIP: MusicLM sample: reverb arpeggio]"},{"author":"Palmer","text":"It\u2019s not doing the first thing it was asked for. Rising synth playing an arpeggio, but there\u2019s no arpeggio. It\u2019s delightful. It\u2019s got the reverb they\u2019re talking about. The pads are backing it, so yeah \u2026. Let\u2019s see what this is \u2026 [a] slow-tempo, bass and drums, reggae song. [CLIP: MusicLM sample: reggae]"},{"author":"Palmer","text":"So, that\u2019s actually exactly backwards from a reggae rhythm. This one is ... [CLIP: MusicLM sample: swing]"},{"author":"Palmer","text":"So, they call that swing\u2014except that that\u2019s not swing. This is \u201cswung,\u201d but it\u2019s not swing."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[laughs]"},{"author":"Palmer","text":"Again, it\u2019s early days. I\u2019m not\u2026 It\u2019s so impressive. What it is is so impressive. There\u2019s no way that I\u2019m going to sit here and take a shot at these guys. Oh, my goodness. This is, like, amazing. And I know where it\u2019s going, and I\u2019m excited about it, I really am. I don\u2019t see anything to be scared of. The first time I was this excited musically\u2026 and it was the first time I heard a fully synthesized piece of music."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I have to agree\u2014it\u2019s hard not to get excited listening to these. My personal favorites are the painting examples where they fed the AI a written description of famous paintings. Here we\u2019ve got Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s The Persistence of Memory, aka his melting clocks painting."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: MusicLM sample: The Persistence of MemoryNarrator: \u201cHis melting-clock imagery mocks the rigidity of chronometric time. The watches themselves look like soft cheese\u2014indeed, by Dali\u2019s own account, they were inspired by hallucinations after eating Camembert cheese. In the center of the picture, under one of the watches, is a distorted human face in profile. The ants on the plate represent decay.\u201d]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Honestly, the Dali painting feels appropriate, given how surreal listening to these samples seems. And it\u2019s only possible because the Google team figured out how to compress raw audio even further than OpenAI\u2019s Jukebox could. Those little tokens, the ones that represent pieces of the music\u2014typically, each would capture about 50 milliseconds of audio, about this much time. [CLIP: Fifty-millisecond bleep]"},{"author":"Jesse Engel: ","text":"What MusicLM does, on top of that, is uses an even more coarse representation ...."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That\u2019s Jesse Engel, one of the engineers who designed MusicLM."},{"author":"Engel","text":"\u2026at the level of, like, three seconds or so. [CLIP: Three-second bleep] And that\u2019s one that we can control in all sorts of new kinds of ways. You can use it to look at a certain piece of music and say, okay, these are the very high-level features of this music on the level of seconds. Now, \u201cPlease generate some more music that has some of these types of features.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"You may notice that the audio quality is, admittedly, still pretty rough."},{"author":"Engel","text":"They are, in essence, the same thing that happens when you take a guitar and you stick it up to an amplifier, and it causes feedback. [CLIP: Feedback]"},{"author":"Engel","text":"We\u2019re taking the outputs of the model, and we\u2019re sticking it back into the inputs of the model.... It\u2019s just feedback that, instead of a single tone, is turning into music in these beautiful ways. But when it fails, it does sort of actually kind of sound a bit like feedback and has all these different tones sort of take on unnatural sorts of timbres to them."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But you can already hear how the quality has gotten better in just the past few years."},{"author":"McLeavey","text":"For Jukebox, the audio quality itself was okay but not amazing. And in some ways, that\u2019s actually why I always felt okay with it as a musician, because I was like, \u201cOkay, this is, like, good enough to be cool and interesting and maybe spark people\u2019s creativity but not quite good enough to be like to feel threatening as a musician.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But that reality seems to be changing\u2014and quick."},{"author":"Palmer","text":"It\u2019s early, they just\u2014this is the sample for goodness\u2019s sake. Like, wait till this thing gets real\u2014like, when this thing is production ready.... we're so close. So close.
