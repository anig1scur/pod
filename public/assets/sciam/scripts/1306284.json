It's really all about the amount of alcohol that you consume, and how quickly, and then other factors like how much water you've had, how much food you've had, that sort of effect how quickly your body processes it."

And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy to get funding and recruit people for a study where you make them drink to the point that they\u2019ll get a hangover."

      "author": "Bartels: ",
      "text": "I don't think I would sign up for that study. And the other thing is like when someone comes into an emergency room or something after drinking, you can measure their blood alcohol content. But when someone's hungover, you can ask them how much they drank, but you don't know if that's accurate. So it's trickier methodologically"

      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Eating before drinking is definitely the best. But even after drinking, I often find myself craving salty, greasy food. That may be because it replenishes electrolytes, since alcohol makes you pee them out. As for \u201chair of the dog,\u201d well\u2026"
    },
    {
      "author": "Bartels: ",
      "text": "I mean, I guess maybe in the short run, it'll help a little bit because the problem with a hangover is that it's basically withdrawal from alcohol. So if you're drinking, then you're sort of reversing that withdrawal, but you're just postponing the inevitable\u2014you're still gonna feel bad, it'll just be later."
