But that conditioning can make it incredibly difficult to speak up when we know something is wrong, whether that means correcting a mishandled coffee order or standing up against injustice. How can we learn to overcome these instincts when it really counts?"},{"author":"","text":"My guest today is Sunita Sah, a professor of management and organizations at Cornell University and the author of Defy: The Power of No in a World that Demands Yes. She thinks we could all stand to be a little more defiant, and she\u2019s here to tell us why."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today."},{"author":"Sunita Sah","text":"It\u2019s wonderful to be here."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So tell us a bit about your background. You know, what led you to studying defiance?"},{"author":"Sah","text":"Ah, so this probably started way back in my childhood because as a child I was really known for being an obedient daughter and student. And I remember asking my dad when I was quite young, \u201cWhat does my name mean?\u201d And he told me that Sunita means \u201cgood\u201d in Sanskrit, and I mainly lived up to that: I was obedient at home. I was agreeable at school. I did all of my homework. I went to school on time. I even got my hair cut the way my parents wanted me to."},{"author":"","text":"And these were the messages that I received not just from parents but from teachers and the community: to be good. And what does that really mean? It means to do as you\u2019re told, to obey, to be obedient, to be compliant. And I really internalized a lot of those messages, and I think they\u2019re often messages that we give to children. You know, we like it when they\u2019re obedient, and then we call that as being really good."},{"author":"","text":"And I ended up studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which was really due to expectations. And while I was there I did an intercalated degree in psychology, and I became fascinated by Stanley Milgram\u2019s experiments on obedience to authority and why we go to the extent of that amount of compliance and obedience even when we\u2019re causing harm, maybe even killing another person, with sort of dangerous electric shocks."},{"author":"","text":"So that fascinated me, but I went back, and I finished my medical degree, and I worked as a junior doctor, and then I did some consulting work for the pharmaceutical industry. And during that time I became fascinated in how industry and the medical profession interact with each other, how they influence each other, how that affects physicians and then how that trickles down to sort of decisions patients are making."},{"author":"","text":"And I wanted to study all of this in more depth, and so I was doing an executive M.B.A. at London Business School, and I talked to a few professors there. They said if you wanna look at ethical dilemmas, I have to go to the U.S. So I traveled to the U.S., and I did a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, and that got me down the track of really being able to spend my time researching and studying this and teaching about why people take bad advice."},{"author":"","text":"So at first I looked in medicine, then the finance industry got interested, then the criminal justice industry, and then basically, in all interpersonal interactions we have, I found this pattern of compliance everywhere."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And for listeners who might need a little refresher could you remind us what the Milgram experiments found?"},{"author":"Sah","text":"So Stanley Milgram, he conducted his experiments in the early 1960s because he wanted to really investigate whether the Nazi refrain, \u201cI was just following orders,\u201d was a psychological reality or not. So he set up an experiment that basically was positioned as a learning or memory experiment and whether people would learn better if they were\u2014received some kind of punishment, which were electric shocks."},{"author":"","text":"So we had people come in, and they met someone who was actually an actor, and they were told that this person would be the learner, and they would be strapped into something like\u2014that looked like an electric chair that was gonna give them some electric shocks."},{"author":"","text":"Then the participant was led to another room, and they were told that they were the teacher, and they were sat in front of a machine that had different levers on it, which were labeled with different voltages. And the lower voltages, it started at 15 volts, and it went up in 15-volt increments, all the way up to 450 volts, which was labeled \u201cXXX.\u201d And in advance people, psychiatrists, predicted less than 1 percent would go up to 450 volts."},{"author":"","text":"And what the teacher had to do was read out word pairs, and if the learner got something wrong, they had to pull the lever for the shocks and go up in these 15-bolt increments. No electric shocks were actually given, but the teacher believed that they would\u2019ve been given. And what was found is that every single one pushed the lever for 150 volts, when the learner started saying to stop. Every single one pushed the lever at 300 volts, after which the learner was completely silent and said they would not continue. And [almost] 66 percent went up to 450 volts ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Sah","text":"And gave, yes, the most lethal shock."},{"author":"","text":"So this was really shocking [laughs] to many people. And what fascinated me when I looked at the Milgram studies is that Milgram also described the participants as having some nervous laughter, asking questions, stuttering, sweating, and I recognized all of those signs as that these people actually were not \u201cmoral imbeciles,\u201d as what Milgram described them, but they were trying to defy, they were trying to say no\u2014they just didn\u2019t know how. They\u2019d never been taught how to do it. And so they continued with what they were told to do by someone that looked like they were an authority figure, even though inside they felt torn."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I think that does a really great job of illustrating what you are referring to in your work when you say, you know, compliance or defiance. But what makes it difficult for humans to be defiant when they know that it\u2019s important to be?"},{"author":"Sah","text":"Yeah, well, we actively resist defiance, and even though the Milgram experiments were a long time ago we\u2019re still seeing things like this. When I started delving into this in my own research I saw such high levels of compliance with obviously bad advice."},{"author":"","text":"So even in the simplest of experiments\u2014like, you would give people a choice between two different lotteries, A or B, and it\u2019s obvious that lottery A is clearly superior; it\u2019s more than two times the expected value. More than 95 percent of people will choose it when given both options, but under certain circumstances\u2014a stranger comes up to them and recommends that you take B\u2014people start complying. And that compliance can be as high as 85 percent, even though they don\u2019t want to and they\u2019re less satisfied with their choice."},{"author":"","text":"So why does this happen? Why do we find that, in another survey, nine out of 10 health care workers, most of them nurses, feel too uncomfortable to speak up when they see a colleague or a physician making an error. Why do we find these things?"},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s three main reasons. First of all we feel enormous pressure to go along with other people, this social pressure. And one psychological process, which I can explain in a little bit, I call \u201cinsinuation anxiety\u201d goes along with that."},{"author":"","text":"The second reason is that we don\u2019t actually understand what compliance and defiance and consent actually are. Like, we conflate compliance and consent; we think they\u2019re the same thing. And they\u2019re not. And we don\u2019t really understand what defiance is; we think of it as something negative and compliance as something positive."},{"author":"","text":"And then the third one is once we decide that we defy, or we think we should defy, we don\u2019t actually know how because we\u2019ve been trained so much from a young age to be compliant, we don\u2019t have the skill set to be defiant. We don\u2019t know how to say no. We feel that is too confrontational."},{"author":"","text":"So they\u2019re the three main reasons. So let me loop back to the first one again. Like, there\u2019s a lot of reasons why we\u2019ll feel pressure to go along with other people. We might think that we\u2019re gonna damage a relationship or lose our job. But one of the reasons I found is due to this very powerful psychological force that I call insinuation anxiety. And this is a distinct type of anxiety that we have when we become concerned that rejecting another person\u2019s order or suggestion gives them a signal that we don\u2019t trust them."},{"author":"","text":"So like telling the experimenter in the Milgram experiment, who\u2019s wearing a lab coat, \u201cWe think you\u2019re doing the wrong thing; we think you might be killing this person,\u201d is very difficult to do. Telling your boss that you don\u2019t think this is the right way to go is often very difficult for people to do. Even telling someone you\u2019re in a relationship with or a family member or a good friend that they\u2019re wrong or that they\u2019re incompetent or that they\u2019re untrustworthy is really hard. So we often experience this in many different situations, from at the doctor\u2019s to co-workers to close friends and even strangers, I\u2019ve found in my experiments."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So how can we overcome those instincts? What can we do about it?"},{"author":"Sah","text":"One of the first things is to have a mindset shift about what defiance really means. So the Oxford English Dictionary defines defiance as challenging the power of another person openly and boldly, but I do think that definition is too narrow, and it doesn\u2019t really honor our agency."},{"author":"","text":"My definition of defiance is simply acting in accordance with your true values, especially when there is pressure to do otherwise. So it doesn\u2019t need to be dramatic or loud or confrontational; it\u2019s just acting in a way that\u2019s aligned to who you want to be. And so it becomes this proactive positive force."},{"author":"","text":"If we redefine defiance in this way, we move it from something negative, rare and risky to something positive and more accessible and meaningful and even prosocial. So defiance isn\u2019t just for the brave or the extraordinary. It\u2019s not about being loud or bold or violent or aggressive. It\u2019s none of those things. It\u2019s acting in alignment with your true values, and it is available and necessary for all of us."},{"author":"","text":"The second step is to start practicing small, so start with small acts of defiance: correcting the wrong coffee order, you know? [Laughs.] A lot of us might not do that. Or telling your hairdresser to stop when they tell you to trust them with a new cut, right? So we can start in these small-stakes situations to build up this skill set."},{"author":"","text":"But we really need to make this defiance a practice and see it not as a personality trait. And that practice starts long before a moment of crisis, when you really wish you had done the right thing or said the right thing. And so to do that we need to anticipate those situations, visualize it, even roll script so our ears get used to hearing defiant words, our mouth gets used to saying it, especially if you\u2019ve been socialized to be compliant."},{"author":"","text":"There\u2019s a wonderful quote that\u2019s often attributed to Bruce Lee\u2014it actually comes from a Greek poet\u2014that\u2019s really helpful here, that \u201cunder duress we don\u2019t rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Sah","text":"So we need to parent for defiance, too. Like, we need to parent our children not just for compliance but for defiance. And if we were socialized to be compliant, we need to start practicing."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, what advice do you have for parents specifically? I think that\u2019s such an interesting way of looking at fostering defiance."},{"author":"Sah","text":"So the first thing that parents can do is definitely role-model defiance. Even though my parents were pretty compliant, and I saw them as, as very compliant\u2014I really thought my mum, who did all the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, that this is what goodness is, until one day I saw her defy, when we were walking home from the grocery store and we were stopped by a group of teenage boys who blocked our path and yelled out, \u201cGo back home!\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And that was the first time I saw her defy, when she just asked them simply, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d And they didn\u2019t answer. And she asked them again, you know, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d And there was just silence. And so she went, \u201cOh, yes, you think you\u2019re so clever\u2014big, strong, tough boys, right?\u201d And the boys didn\u2019t know what to do. They just looked at each other, and then they dispersed. And so it really worked in that sense: \u201cI\u2019ve got to know when and where to speak up.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And then if we can ask our children, we can do values exercises with them: \u201cWhat are our family values?\u201d Because if we can do that and talk to our children about how to defy, then what I hope is that we will build a society where one day in that same alleyway one of the teenage boys is gonna speak up and turn to his friends and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not okay. Let them pass.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And that\u2019s what I think we can build if we can get this skill set of being defiant. Because every single act of consent, of compliance, of dissent, that actually creates the society we live in. It affects our lives, our workplaces, our communities. And what I hope with my book and the work and the research that I\u2019ve done is that I make defiance accessible to people that don\u2019t know how to use it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to talk with us today.
