      "text": ": For Science, Quickly, I\u2019m Meg Duff. As the world heats up, many of the consequences of burning fossil fuels are now painfully obvious. But there\u2019s also this less intuitive consequence: under our feet, the economy responsible for the growth of trees and forests is experiencing inflation. In case you aren\u2019t familiar, atmospheric carbon is a currency that plants use to \u201cbuy\u201d nutrients from fungi in the soil. But now there\u2019s too much carbon, and that \u201ccurrency\u201d is being devalued. In our last episode, we talked about why this is humans\u2019 fault. Now we want to take you down into the tree roots, where this trading happens.\u00a0 And then, all the way up to outer space, where scientists are figuring out how to map forests from satellites. First, to find out where this economy will go next, the devil is in the details. And the details are in the dirt."

      "text": ": This micro-economy beneath our feet is astounding. Here\u2019s how it works. Some fungi help dead things decompose, releasing nutrients. Then the fungi associated with tree roots scavenge for nutrients and trade them to trees in return for sugar, which comes from carbon. The root fungi are called mycorrhizae: \u201cmyco\u201d means fungi, and \u201crhizae,\u201d means root. And you can think of mycorrhizae as falling into two basic categories. First: the ectomycorrhizae."

      "text": "There\u2019s a reason why this matters. Ectomycorrhizae and arbuscular mycorrhizae specialize in getting different nutrients, and they trade those nutrients to trees at different price points. Those prices impact how much carbon trees have to spend and how much they get to save. To visualize how this works, it\u2019s important to know that different trees tend to partner with different fungi."

Say you both do your nutrient shopping\u2014you buy some nitrogen, some phosphorus. At the end of the day, you each have some carbon left over to invest in growth. But you may have a little bit more left than the oak tree. You grow a little bigger. These details are actually very relevant for humans. Any big company planting trees or protecting forests to offset its carbon emissions is assuming that those trees are investing their carbon in extra leaves, in fatter trunks, whatever. But to know how much carbon forests can actually store, we also need to know how much they spend. Crucially, those prices can change over time. [CLIP: Forest sounds] Say these trees are feeling flush. They all want to put out more leaves and fatten up their trunks. But to do that, they all need extra phosphorus. And in one forest, the soil starts running out."

He says that both fungi probably raise their phosphorus prices but maybe at different rates. If the prices go high enough, the economy will crash: trees will grow more slowly and reproduce less. Right now most forests take in more carbon than they release. But wildfires and deforestation make that harder. Add an economic slowdown, and forests overall could become a carbon source instead of a carbon sink. Here\u2019s what\u2019s next. To figure out what will happen to forests and, consequently, to the climate\u2014we need to map which fungi are where and watch how they are changing their prices. Doing so may help us understand whether forests are headed for an economic crash and, if so, what that will mean for our own carbon budget.\u00a0 Renato tells me that it\u2019s still painstakingly hard to map different species of trees. But his colleagues have figured out how to map the fungi in their roots.\u00a0\u00a0"

Those economic trends will impact how much forests grow this century, whether they can successfully migrate as temperatures change and whether they will continue to store all the extra carbon we are burning.
