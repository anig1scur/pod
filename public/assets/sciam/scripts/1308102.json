That increase was sharper in people under the age of 50. With so-called early onset cancers on the rise, scientists are working to sort out the complex tangle of factors that can contribute to someone\u2019s risk."},{"author":"","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. I\u2019m joined today by Dr. Jasmine McDonald. She is an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for coming in to chat with us today."},{"author":"Jasmine McDonald","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So I know that you study breast cancer, but can you tell me more about your particular area of expertise?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"I got my training in basic science, and I was very interested in signaling pathways and how those pathways are associated with disease. And now I\u2019m a molecular epidemiologist."},{"author":"","text":"And so I\u2019m very much interested in the progression of developing breast cancer, but how that happens across a woman\u2019s life course, so from in utero to pubertal to postpartum: those periods of time where we know the breast tissue is more sensitive to outside assaults or exposures and how that plays a role in developing breast cancer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, and what has changed about breast cancer risk or, or diagnosis in recent years?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"There\u2019s been an increase in early onset breast cancer, so this means that there\u2019s an increase in young women developing breast cancer before the age of 50; some even defined it as developing breast cancer before the age of 45."},{"author":"","text":"This is very concerning, as cancer is usually considered a disease of old age. You have to live long enough to develop cancer. But now we\u2019re seeing that this rise in early onset\u2014and it\u2019s not just breast cancer; they\u2019re seeing it in colorectal cancer and some other cancers as well."},{"author":"","text":"But what\u2019s very concerning is that many of the subtypes of breast cancer for young women there\u2019s a high frequency of diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer or estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer."},{"author":"","text":"And what this means is that the tumor itself is going to be more aggressive. There\u2019s going to be challenges in treating that particular tumor. Outcomes are going to be somewhat worse when you have this particular subtype of breast cancer."},{"author":"","text":"And not only that\u2014if you think about it, these women are quite young. Therefore, even surviving the diagnosis, they have the rest of their life to continue to live with this higher risk of developing a new cancer diagnosis or a recurrent breast cancer diagnosis."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And when we look at those rising rates, what are we seeing at the demographic level?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So the rising rates are seen pretty much all over. I mean, even\u2014you can see it in Ghana. You can see it in India. Like, it\u2019s really a, a global experience. But we know that Black women, women of African ancestry, are diagnosed at earlier, younger ages. They\u2019re more likely to be diagnosed with the aggressive breast cancer subtypes, like estrogen receptor negative, and they\u2019re more likely to have worse outcomes. And we know that Black women have a greater mortality compared to white women when it comes to being diagnosed with breast cancer\u2014that means dying from the disease."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right. And I definitely wanna talk some more about what might be contributing to that disparity. But before we get into that, what makes it difficult to study cancer risk?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Cancer is hard to study because it is a disease of age. You have to live long enough to develop cancer. It\u2019s not something where you are exposed, and then boom, you have the disease, like an infection. This is something where there\u2019s a mutation, that mutation can be harmful or non-harmful, that mutation can cause another mutation, etcetera, etcetera. But it\u2019s a long, latent process. Therefore, when you\u2019re thinking about epidemiology and you\u2019re looking at what causes cancer, oftentimes, what caused the initial mutation or progression may be very distal, or far from the diagnosis."},{"author":"","text":"And so that makes it very challenging, especially\u2014people consider cancer, like, \u201cOh, like, cancer\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Yes, it is. However, in order to study it, you need a very large population. And that means that when you\u2019re thinking about an exposure\u2014smoking and lung cancer: well, there was a time where there was a very high percentage of people who were smoking, so that was something you could study."},{"author":"","text":"But with breast cancer, there\u2019s so many different causative agents that we consider that you need a very large population to really understand exposures, and that makes it very challenging cost-wise, as well as you need to follow from the time that event happened [to] 20, 30, 40, 50 years in the future."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah, so what are you doing in, in your research to try to answer those questions?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So we look at intermediate outcomes. One of the things I really am interested in is periods in life where we know the breast tissue is dividing very rapidly. This is in utero, so I\u2019ve looked at women who were exposed to pesticides in the womb and their mammographic density, meaning the density of their breast."},{"author":"","text":"This is when you get a mammogram. And now when you get a mammogram, it tells you if you have dense breasts. We know that breast density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. So it\u2019s, like, an intermediate biological marker."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"I study puberty. We know that an earlier age that a girl starts breast development and the earlier age that she starts her period, the greater the risk for breast cancer. So as an intermediate, you can look at exposures that are associated with an earlier age of developing puberty."},{"author":"","text":"So you start looking at intermediate markers and risk factors that are associated with breast cancer if you can\u2019t follow them for 20, 30, 40, 50 years."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. So what kind of associations are, are you finding?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"There\u2019s different things I\u2019ve looked at. One is looking at environmental exposure as it relates to pesticides. This is when young kids were running behind the fog trucks ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And it was a pesticide for mosquitoes, but it was used on crops, it was used at the pool, it was used everywhere\u2014where those, I guess, fetus[es] that were exposed in the womb, they have denser breasts. It\u2019s also been shown that they have a higher risk of developing breast cancer if their mother also developed breast cancer."},{"author":"","text":"We also look at personal care product exposure. So we\u2019ve shown that the use of certain hair products, especially, like, hair oils, is associated with an earlier age of starting one\u2019s period, and this was especially in Black girls. And we do see that Black girls develop pubertal markers much earlier than their counterparts. So you can see as young as age five, African American girls developing breast[s], and that is a, a biomarker for developing a high risk factor for breast cancer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"You mentioned groups in particular where you, you find the rates of cancer diagnosis really, really concerning. So what do you think is leading to those disparities?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So disparities often result from\u2014when there\u2019s something you can do about it, that\u2019s when disparities arise."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So if we think about the incidence rate of breast cancer, typically it\u2019s always been that white women have a higher incidence rate, as in, like, being diagnosed with the disease ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And Black women have a higher mortality rate. Now the rate of being diagnosed with the disease is pretty much equivalent for Black women and white women. And when we think about mortality, the reason that it spread is because of the invention of, like, the mammogram, which allows you to detect it early."},{"author":"","text":"Detecting a tumor early is the best prognostic way to survive from that diagnosis because there\u2019s more that you can do, and you are catching it, hopefully, at an earlier stage, a lower grade, and your outcomes are much better."},{"author":"","text":"But once you put in that technological advancement of mammograms, that has to be equitably available to all populations, regardless of demographic. When that doesn\u2019t occur, disparities exist because there\u2019s one population getting the benefit over the other, so you\u2019ll start seeing those benefits in the statistics of our nation. So when there\u2019s something you can do, disparities will arise."},{"author":"","text":"I think when it also comes to exposures, socially disadvantaged groups have a higher burden of certain structural environmental exposures. And so one thing that we study is the inequity as it comes to beauty standards."},{"author":"","text":"And so when we think about our normal routine as a woman and waking up and doing our hair, putting on lotion\u2014all of those things\u2014spritzing ourselves, it\u2019s not that different. However, we know that Black women, given the nation\u2019s beauty standards\u2014or the societal; it\u2019s not even our nation. I mean, it\u2019s global ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Societal beauty standards. Even in India there\u2019s a high rate of using skin lighteners that contain metals, which are carcinogenic, to achieve lighter skin because lighter skin is more beautiful, it\u2019s more acceptable, it\u2019s more societally advancing."},{"author":"","text":"So in the United States straight hair is more acceptable. I\u2019ve known people who got fired for having cornrows\u2014who worked in the back of a shop ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Didn\u2019t even see customers and still got fired for wearing cornrows ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So that means that there\u2019s been products that are overburdened in a certain population that are not experienced in other populations ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Like perms and relaxers. And perms and relaxers is something that are unique to the Black experience. It\u2019s also something that starts very early in age. It\u2019s also something that\u2019s chronic usage. It\u2019s not a one-hit problem. Once you start using it, you usually have to continue using it\u2014unless you cut off all your hair ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And do the big chop."},{"author":"","text":"So we\u2019re talking about young age of exposure, repetitive exposure cumulatively. And this all plays a role in having an overburden of adverse chemicals like endocrine-disruptor chemicals, carcinogenic chemicals that increases your risk of having cellular mutation. And that cellular mutation being advantageous for tumor progression\u2014or tumor initiation to progression."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. I think a lot of people, when they think about cancer risk and read about cancer risk, they see a lot of, a lot of stuff about lifestyle that can be, you know, really very frustrating and, and unhelpful. What needs to change at the systemic level to address this stuff?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Systemically, people can\u2019t be blamed for the environment that they live in."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"I mean, it\u2019s just not fair. I mean, there\u2019s only so much an individual can do, and sometimes what the individual is doing is overridden by the environment."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Like, we know that endocrine-disruptor chemicals have their hormonal agents that can disrupt our natural hormonal system. Our hormones are linked to so many things: It\u2019s bidirectional communication with our immune system. It\u2019s linked to periods, obesity, everything from birth outcomes. Like, it\u2019s so pervasive. But yet we don\u2019t really acknowledge that endocrine-disruptor chemicals are in our food packaging, in our personal care products, if you go into buildings that smell really amazing [laughs]. You know, like ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Like, really, they\u2019re just environmentally pervasive. But yet we as an individual are supposed to individually change our lifestyle and behaviors to decrease our breast cancer risk. I think societally there needs to be federal regulations that reduce our exposure to these toxicants because there\u2019s only so much an individual can do, and why do we blame the individual for developing cancer?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Cancer is not something\u2014I mean, yes, radiation, okay, but even people, even pilots, who fly all the time, I mean [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"You know, there\u2019s just\u2014there\u2019s something about it where cancer\u2019s one of the\u2014those things where they say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s your fault. Like, you did something. You could have done something to prevent this,\u201d and that\u2019s not truly the case."},{"author":"","text":"I have a friend who, I mean, ridiculously healthy\u2014like, just, like, makes-her-own-granola healthy."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah ..."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And developed breast cancer ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"At a young age. There was no lifestyle factor that would have contributed to that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I think, I think, speaking from personal experience for a few family members who had cancer at a young age, I think a lot of that stuff comes from people\u2019s fear: They wanna feel like they\u2019re in control of their future health. They wanna feel like there\u2019s something that they\u2019re doing that\u2019s gonna prevent that from happening to them. As you said, like, a lot of, a lot of systemic stuff [laughs] is way bigger of an issue."},{"author":"","text":"The personal blame\u2014totally inappropriate, unhelpful\u2014but I think a lot of people listening to this or watching this who maybe aren\u2019t thinking about personal care products, for example, might want to know what they can do to, to avoid these exposures. So what advice do you have for them?"},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So my advice is that, you know, when you\u2019re picking out a product, especially when we\u2019re talking about a personal care product, that\u2019s gonna be absorbed into the largest organ of your body, the skin, or going to be directly absorbed by your scalp or things that are gonna just sit on you, you wanna make sure you\u2019re selecting products that are less toxic."},{"author":"","text":"So for example, when you see a product that says \u201cfragrance,\u201d that is a synonym for phthalates, which are endocrine-disruptor chemicals that have been associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth. If you see parabens, those are endocrine-disruptor chemicals. I also don\u2019t believe that individuals need to get a chemistry degree ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"To pick a product. So there are different apps out there where you can scan the product if you\u2019re in person with your phone. If you\u2019re buying a product from, like, Amazon or Walmart, there\u2019s Clearya, where when you select it, it\u2019s a little app that tells you if it\u2019s, like, very harmful or what harmful chemicals are in it."},{"author":"","text":"So there are ways to choose a healthier, less toxic product that\u2019s affordable as well because a lot of people have\u2014the concern is, like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no way I can change my behavior because I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d But there are affordable less-toxic products."},{"author":"","text":"And we also have to really consider our children. They don\u2019t have the autonomy on what gets placed on their body or their hair. They\u2019re often using either baby products or toddler products, which also may be quite harmful. Even no-lye relaxer that was made for young Black girls contains chemicals that are banned by the European Union Cosmetic Directive."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So we also have to be considerate, like, are we using products in our household that are household-friendly for everyone?"},{"author":"","text":"I also suggest just changing things over time because it can be very overwhelming to say, like, \u201cOh, my gosh, like, I have to change my perfume, my lotion, my mascara, my\u2014\u201d It is a lifestyle. It is a habit. It is a routine. And as long as it took you to find that perfect shade of eyeshadow, well, now you have to re\u2026discover a perfect shade of eyeshadow that is less toxic. And have fun with it ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"You know? Like, don\u2019t make it such that you\u2019re adding stress \u2019cause stress is also carcinogenic, so [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] That\u2019s a great point."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"So, you know, have fun with it, but choose that item that you cannot go without."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And then change that ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"And then choose the next item, and then keep going."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"I also say that, you know, when it comes to plastics, don\u2019t microwave food in plastics. Don\u2019t eat hot food out of plastics. Avoid using plastic spoons and forks when you\u2019re eating hot foods. This may mean that you have to replace one Tupperware for another. This means that you may have to invest in a really nice water bottle over another. But these are long-term investments that have long-term health benefits because you are reducing your exposures."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right. And I love the point you made about going slowly because, you know, I think it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that every little change you make is a good change."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And it\u2019s often way more sustainable to do it that way than try to clean your house out all at once [laughs] ..."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Exactly. And the thing is, like, people don\u2019t realize but some of these chemicals have a very short half-life. That means, like, you use \u2019em; you pee \u2019em out. You use \u2019em; you pee \u2019em out. The only reason they are so harmful is because we use them routinely ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"It\u2019s part of our routine. So even though they get metabolized and they\u2019re out of your system very quickly, you do something every day and every day\u2014consistently, chronically, you\u2019re exposing yourself."},{"author":"","text":"And that\u2019s why changing your routine\u2014you know, just saying, like, \u201cOkay, you know what? I have to wear this particular eyeshadow, so let me go to XYZ store to find something that is less toxic, and see how I like it.\u201d And then keep going like that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I\u2019m sure a lot of viewers and listeners will want to check out some of the apps and other resources you mentioned, so we\u2019ll definitely include those in, in our show notes so folks can find them."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Yes, and I just want to also say there\u2019s, for your listeners who are of African ancestry, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners has a Non-Toxic Black Beauty Project that highlights different Black-owned companies that are producing clean, nontoxic products. For example, Sienna Naturals is Issa Rae and Hannah Diop\u2019s new line, and I\u2019m only saying that \u2019cause I use it [laughs] and I do enjoy it."},{"author":"","text":"But there are many, many products. A lot of people feel like, \u201cOkay, especially as a Black woman, like, is it even gonna work? Like, I already have, like, pretty much a store in my house of products that I no longer use \u2026\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"\u201c\u2019Cause they don\u2019t work.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Don\u2019t let that deter you from changing your lifestyle. Don\u2019t give up. You didn\u2019t give up when you found the perfect shampoo in the first place, so don\u2019t give up for finding, like, that perfect alternative."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s great advice. Thank you so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"McDonald","text":"Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
