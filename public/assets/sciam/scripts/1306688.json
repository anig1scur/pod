There\u2019s sexual cannibalism, aka praying mantises preying on their lovers or black widow females making babies and then making widows out of their mates. And then there\u2019s the ol\u2019 run-of-the-mill cannibalism. One of our closest genetic relatives, chimpanzees, have been documented engaging in cannibalism\u2014hey, it\u2019s hard out there for a chimp. [CLIP: Chimp pant-hoot]"

      "text": "So when was the first recorded instance of cannibalism in our human history? Like most things in science, it\u2019s a little complicated. Paleoanthropologists, the scientists that study human origins, will look at bones for cut marks to determine if there is evidence of cannibalism or perhaps ritual defleshing. \u201cPaleoanthros\u201d also need to determine who the bone belonged to and who may have done the devouring\u2014especially during the mid-late Pleistocene, when there were multiple species in the genus Homo roaming parts of Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Paleoanthropologists also have various specialties from studying bipedalism to pathology, increases in brain size and changes in our ancestors\u2019 diet. So if a fossil is only studied by a paleoanthropologist with one specific focus, other clues may be missed. Thus, there are benefits when multiple researchers from different paleoanthro subfields look over the same fossil. We get a clearer look at the big picture! And it turns out there\u2019s some new research\u2014by Smithsonian Institution paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner and Colorado State University paleoanthropologist Michael Pante\u2014that reveals that our hominin ancestors might have actually eaten one another 1.45 million years ago!\u00a0 It all comes down to this mystery around an ancient tibia, or shin bone. But this fossil wasn\u2019t a new find."

For instance, researchers can now go back over museum specimens from a different specialty and use updated technology to glean new data from old finds. Because Briana is familiar with looking at bite marks versus cut marks, she can pick up these forgotten bones and discover new clues about the fate of that individual. Basically, she knows what a bite mark looks like."

      "author": "Pante: ",
      "text": "In the past you would just look at the bone for certain features. A cut mark would have more of a V-shape profile if you, like, put a slice through it and looked at the shape of the interior of the mark. There should be, potentially, linear striations within that mark, and on modern bones, you would have a buildup of bone on the edge, on the shoulder of the mark. But that tends to go away after, you know, things become fossilized and exposed to different processes. With a tooth mark, you would have more of a U-shaped profile. It\u2019s broader, generally, and also the interior surface would be crushed."

      "author": "Pante: ",
      "text": "The exception is crocodile tooth marks, which morphologically do have some similarities with cut marks. But usually those marks are much deeper, and instead of building up of bone on the side, you actually see peeling of the bone due to the force that was applied when the bite was inflicted."
    },
    {
      "author": "Reagan: ",
      "text": "That is because crocodiles have the highest bite force of any living animal at 3,700 psi, or pounds per square inch\u2014further proof crocodiles are stone-cold death machines. Oh, and for perspective, a human\u2019s average bite force is a measly 162 pounds per square inch. Great for snapping celery stalks\u2014not to digress. Because this tibia had bite marks and potential cut marks on it, Briana and Michael figured that the individual in question could have been mostly consumed by a predator and then scavenged by another hominin, or vice versa. But what about the stone inflicting these marks?Spoiler alert: these are not your mama\u2019s ginsu knives. Around 2.6 million years ago, the Oldowan tool industry was born. Think very basic hammerstones, cores and flakes\u2014nothing too fancy. Then things progressed. [CLIP: Sounds of creating stone tools]"

    {
      "author": "Pobiner",
      "text": "At about one and a half-ish million years ago, the main stone tool technology that was around was the Acheulean. So this was kind of the first change in stone tool technology.... The Acheulean was a bifacial technology, so you\u2019re taking flakes off around both sides of the face of your stone. The kind of characteristic tool of the Acheulean is a hand ax. [It] was usually a teardrop-shape tool but still very simple\u2014basically, kind of stones with sharp edges that were used probably to cut things, maybe for digging, maybe for sharpening sticks, maybe for breaking open bones to getting at the marrow inside."
    },
    {
      "author": "Reagan",
      "text": "And if you\u2019re hip to the latest diet craze, you may be aware that bone broth, which is made from bone marrow, is very nutritious. So our ancestors would have benefited greatly from breaking open bones. But with a baby bite force of 162 psi, humans and our ancestors needed the help from stone tools to access that marrow. So who was this extinct executioner/hungry hominin/pleistocene poker? Well, 1.45 million years ago at the archaeological site Koobi Fora in Kenya, there were three hominin species living in the same area: Homo erectus, Homo habilis and Paranthropus boisei. The first contender is Homo habilis, which means \u201chandy man.\u201dThis specieswas found in 1960 and given this name in 1964 by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey (husband of Mary Leakey) and his colleagues because it was thought to be the first hominin to manufacture stone tools. Funnily enough, in 1960 Louis Leakey also sent a young student to Tanzania to study one of our closest genetic relatives, chimpanzees. This particular student also documented chimpanzees using tools to eat termites and ants! Her name? Jane Goodall. But I digress\u2014or should I say digest. Next up is Homo erectus. These bigger-brained, taller drinks of water came after Homo habilis, so they\u2019re definitely associated with stone tools, including Acheulean tools. And last but not least, Parathropus boisei was a smaller-brained species that was not thought to have used tools\u2014until recently. Fun side note: Mary Leakey, the one who discovered this tibia, was also the scientist to discover Paranthropus boisei, whom she first named Zinjanthropus, or Zinj. So we have a few suspicious slayer suspects. But what about the potential victim? Because there is only a tibia with no cranium associated with it, it is hard to pinpoint which species it belonged to on top of who might have eaten this individual. So what if one of the three species had eaten another species rather than its own? Does that still count as cannibalism?"

We really can\u2019t actually call this cannibalism."

      "author": "Reagan",
      "text": "I guess we\u2019ll have to settle for cannibal-adjacent. Still kind of brutal if you ask me! Now, this tibia is not the only evidence of potential cannibalism in our ancestors. There are several Neandertal sites that have fairly substantial evidence of cannibalism.\u00a0 One such site is Krapina Cave in modern-day Croatia."
    },
    {
      "author": "Pante: ",
      "text": "Certainly the most famous of, of those sites would be Krapina in Croatia, and that has been interpreted in various ways, from symbolic behavior involving a process called secondary burial\u2014where people were, were first buried, and they were allowed to decay and then exhumed and then defleshed subsequently\u2014to just cannibalism for a situation like warfare potentially or survival."

Why are people consuming each other? Could it be for something other than a ritual? So, you know, it\u2019s hard to resolve in your mind what the possibilities could be. And how do we actually distinguish between them?"

Are the bones broken for marrow consumption as well\u2014? Because that\u2019s a good indicator that they were processing these for food to the highest level. Are the bones burned? Are they in association and processed in a similar way to animal bones?"

      "text": "There\u2019s some literature that argues that when bones are made into tools or used as tools from humans..., they\u2019re called bone hammers or retouchers\u2014those could be an indicator that this was some type of ritual process. But I\u2019m not sure that really makes sense to me logically. The idea of ritual, at least in early assemblages, is established based on very minimal evidence that can be interpreted in different ways. So it is a challenge, but we are prone to leaning toward an interpretation of ritual rather than consumption alone."

We\u2019ll be sure to stay in touch to see what\u2019s cookin\u2019 next.

We\u2019re really interested in patterns as opposed to one-offs. The one-offs are still interesting. Maybe it implies that we should be looking at hominin fossils for these marks, and people haven\u2019t been as much in this time period before, but I think, you know, at least in this one particular case, it does show that early humans were using stone knives to cut meat or flesh off another early human."
