Every episode, we dive into one topic. We discuss diseases, treatments, and some controversies."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And we demystify the medical research in ways you can use to stay healthy. I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"We\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors. On the show today, we\u2019ve got some surprising news about cholesterol. The so-called \u201cgood\u201d kind is supposed to protect your heart and arteries. But it actually makes things worse under certain circumstances. And doctors are just figuring this out.\u00a0 [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"You go to the doctor for an annual checkup, right, Tanya?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Sure. As any good health editor would!"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Me too. You get asked a bunch of personal questions, a cold stethoscope on your skin, and the doctor draws some blood for standard lab tests. Among those tests, when you get them back, are two cholesterol numbers."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right. One is your level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL. It\u2019s supposed to stay under 130 milligrams per deciliter\u2014the lower the better. The other one is high-density lipoprotein, or HDL. And that\u2019s supposed to stay above 40 milligrams per deciliter. The higher it is, the better, we\u2019re told."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s because LDL is the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, the one that leads to artery-clogging plaques, heart disease, strokes, and other nasty stuff. We want less of it. HDL, on the other hand, is \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. We want more of it."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"HDL has this good reputation because it binds to LDL, carrying that bad stuff to the liver. From there it gets flushed out of your body, where it can\u2019t hurt you."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But \u2026 you know that old saying about having too much of a good thing? It seems to be true of good cholesterol."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So, is it possible to have too much HDL?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"It is totally possible. Turns out that too much HDL actually raises the chances of artery and heart disease, the very things we\u2019re trying to avoid. Once you get above 80 for men and 100 for women\u2014and I\u2019m going to stop saying milligrams per deciliter because it\u2019s a mouthful\u2014you\u2019re in the danger zone. A bunch of recent studies have found this effect. But generally, that\u2019s not what doctors have told patients."},{"author":"Quyyumi","text":"The teaching has been up until recently, that the higher the HDL, the lower the risk. So traditionally, physicians have been using very high HDL levels as a marker of a really healthy cholesterol profile."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s the researcher behind some of the newer studies."},{"author":"Quyyumi","text":"My name is Arshed Quyyumi. I'm professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"He did a study of more than 400,000 people in the U.K., people without other predisposing risk factors for heart disease. For men, cardiac and other disease risks went up if their HDL levels were under 40\u2014or over 80. For women, the risk climbed once HDL levels topped 100."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"When you say \u201cclimbed,\u201d how much of a risk are we talking about? A few small percentage points, or a much bigger increase?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Excellent question, and I asked Quyyumi\u00a0about the amount of extra risk that people faced."},{"author":"Quyummi","text":"If you just took them without any other evaluation of other risk factors like LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, etc, it's almost two fold higher compared to the lowest risk group, which would have levels between 40 to 60."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Even when he and his team took into account those other factors, those with very high HDL had a risk that was 80 percent higher than normal. Other studies back this up. One of them looked at more than 11,000 people with high blood pressure. It found a much higher rate of cardiovascular problems in people with HDL levels both under 40 and over 80."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"OK, let me run through the numbers. HDL is bad if it\u2019s under 40. It\u2019s good if its 40 to 60. Possibly a risk in the 60 to 80 range. And a pretty big risk if its above 80 for men and 100 for women."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yep. \u201cGood cholesterol\u201d is really bad cholesterol over 80 or over 100, depending on your sex, and under 40. The middle zone is the safe zone. Now it\u2019s a bit of a mystery why HDL should turn bad when it goes really high. Why should a molecule help you at level 45, for instance, but hurt you at level 85? It\u2019s possible that the shape of the molecules change. So they don\u2019t latch on tightly to circulating cholesterol and help ferry it out of the body."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Interesting. I want to go back to something intriguing you mentioned: There\u2019s a difference between where men and women enter the HDL danger zone. You said it was over 80 for men, but over 100 for women. Why is that?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"You\u2019re right. There was a 20 point difference between men and women. And honestly, neither Quyyumi\u2019s team nor anyone else really knows why."},{"author":"Quyyumi","text":"Part of it is thought to be just sex hormone differences, you know, estrogen, testosterone differences\u2026. between men and women. There are some genetic reasons for that as well. It\u2019s not really well worked out."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019ve read that estrogen can increase HDL in women, and that it can be protective. But once women reach menopause, their estrogen levels drop, and HDL becomes less protective. In any event, it sounds like women shouldn\u2019t freak out if their HDL is slightly over 80, according to these studies. Though men in that range should be aware they are at risk."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah. And there shouldn\u2019t be a huge number of people freaking out, period. Overall, the research shows that about 7 percent of the general population reaches these scary high HDL levels. But still, that\u2019s nothing to ignore. If a doctor sees 100 patients in a week, 7 of them will be in this HDL danger zone."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"If people are in the danger zone, what should they do?"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I asked Quyyumi about that one, too. Drinking a lot of alcohol drives HDL up, so he\u2019d tell patients guzzling one or two glasses of wine or booze daily to cut it out. There aren\u2019t drugs that bring down high HDL. So the big thing he\u2019d do is focus on treating LDL.\u00a0 Statins, for instance, are very effective at lowering LDL levels, and he\u2019d use those.\u00a0 And baby aspirin, used carefully, can reduce blood clots that lead to heart attacks. Check with your doctor on that one\u2014aspirin can have side effects.\u00a0 And there\u2019s one more thing\u2026"},{"author":"Quyyumi","text":"If they're sedentary, they should be encouraged to exercise. Exercise is helpful for everything."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I guess I\u2019m going to keep going for my morning runs. And I\u2019ll try to keep my \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol low and \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol in that happy middle zone."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Our colleague Lydia Denworth calls it the Goldilocks zone: not too low or too high, but just right. You can read her new Science of Health column on HDL in the middle of May, on sciam.com. And now I\u2019m going to call my doctor to schedule my yearly checkup. ---"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Your Health Quickly is produced and edited by Tulika Bose, Jeff DelViscio, Kelso Harper,\u00a0 and Alexa Lim.
