But Cohen says it also requires a certain amount of rest."},{"author":"Cohen","text":"We know from previous research that interspersing rest with practice during training is advantageous for learning a new skill. In fact, we recently showed that virtually all early skill learning is evidenced during rest rather than during the actual practice."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"It\u2019s during those intermittent breaks that the brain starts to sew together the individual movements that make up a seamless piece.

To find out, Cohen and his colleagues turned to an imaging technique called magnetoencephalography, or MEG."},{"author":"Ethan Buch","text":"The unique advantage of MEG is that it allows us to observe neural activity across the entire brain with millisecond time resolution, which is crucial for investigating very fast widespread brain dynamics."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":"Ethan Buch, Cohen\u2019s colleague at NINDS. They and their team had 30 volunteers sit inside an MEG scanner. And they asked them to type the sequence 41324 on a keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible.

This is Jeff DelViscio, executive producer of the show.\u00a0 The whole podcast team is out in the field, so while we\u2019re away, we\u2019re bringing back a few amazing oldies from the archive. Today we dive into your brain during bouts of intense learning\u2014maybe that happens to you when you listen to this podcast? Producer Karen Hopkin brings us a study that looked at brain training\u2014and how rest might be the key to training your brain even faster.\u00a0 The episode was first aired on July 21, 2021, when we were still called 60-Second Science."]},{"begin":"67.840","end":"69.520","lines":["Ah, memories.\u00a0 Enjoy! --"]},{"begin":"69.520","end":"95.000","lines":["This is Scientific American's 60-Second Science.
