An\u00a0Indian linguist helped preserve one language family."],"authors":["Tulika Bose"],"category":["Anthropology"],"transcript":[{"author":"Tulika Bose","text":"You\u2019re listening to a celebration in the Levenofi village in the remote highlands of the island nation of Papua New Guinea. I was here with our Scientific American video crew last year to make a documentary. I and my co-producer Kelso Harper didn\u2019t know what any of these words meant. But as the entire village\u2014men, women, kids, grannies\u2014swung their hips, waved branches and sang in this beautiful, heartfelt chorus, we knew intuitively that we were being welcomed."},{"author":"Tulika Bose","text":"The energy was infectious\u2014we were encouraged to dance along.\u00a0 [Sound clip] After all of the singing, we were invited to partake in a mumu. It\u2019s this delicious feast that\u2019s made from wrapping meats and vegetables and spices in banana leaves and then cooking them in this massive earth oven with steam and hot stones.\u00a0 Finding myself here\u2014in an island nation that\u2019s home to more than 300 tribes and about 850 different languages\u2014was one of the most remarkable experiences of my entire life. Papua New Guinea also happens to be the most linguistically diverse place on earth."},{"author":"Tulika Bose","text":"But that incredible diversity is declining. Half of the roughly 7,000 languages spoken today could be gone by the end of the century. And Papua New Guinea, which hosts more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s languages, is now finding its own linguistic diversity under threat. After this experience, I had to learn more. Where have we lost languages in other parts of the world, and how have they been forgotten? Are we trying to bring them back? More importantly, how do we trace the roots of our collective memory back to the very sounds that first made us human?"},{"author":"Tulika Bose","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly, this is Tulika Bose. [CLIP: Intro music]"},{"author":"Anvita Abbi","text":"Everybody said, \u201cWhy have you come? We have forgotten our language. We do not know what you\u2019re talking about. We cannot help you at all.\u201d"},{"author":"Bose","text":"That\u2019s Anvita Abbi. She\u2019s this incredible Indian linguist who specializes in Indigenous languages and has this unbelievable passion for decoding grammatical structure."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"Lately, I had\u2014for [the] last two decades, I had been working on the languages of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These are the 550 islands in the Bay of Bengal, south of India. She\u2019s talking to me about the year 2001, when she first arrived in Port Blair, the capital of the Andiman and Nicobar Islands, a territory of India in the Bay of Bengal. Anvita also wrote an article that appeared in our June 2023 issue that goes into this more in depth. (I highly, highly recommend reading it and subscribing.)"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Anvita had previously researched more than 80 Indian languages from five different families. But she was there to conduct a preliminary survey of Indigenous languages. At first, some of the Indigenous residents\u2014known as the Great Andamanese\u2014balked at her request."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"So I knew that they have some memory of the language, of course, but they were denying it."},{"author":"Bose","text":"But Anvita was really persistent. And then she met someone who would change the scope of her research. She called him Nao Junior."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"I tried to ask him several words. He said, \u201cListen, madam, I have not spoken my language for quite some years, but I know my language. So I\u2019ll have to remember.\u201d And that gave me a big clue\u2014that I can see some ray of hope."},{"author":"Bose","text":"When I first heard Anvita\u2019s story, I was stunned. I\u2019m half Bengali myself, but I had never heard of the Great Andamanese, the original Indigenous peoples who lived in the Great Andaman archipelago, or about how the British\u2014who established a penal colony in Port Blair in 1858\u2014wiped almost all of them out through a combination of gunfire and disease. In the 1960s, by which time the islands were governed by India, only 19 members of the Great Andamanese people were left. India settled them on this tiny island called Strait island. And then Anvita visited."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"There were only nine speakers in 2001, when I reached the island."},{"author":"Bose","text":"She knew she had to try to preserve this language family before it all faded away. And so she set out on foot to follow it."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"It was a very, very tough ... I still remember those crocodile-laden creeks that we had to cross and lot\u00a0of snakes who were visiting us day and night\u2014especially at night, in the evening."},{"author":"Bose","text":"While on this trip, Anvita realized something crucial."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"When I presented my results, I claimed that it appears that Great Andamanese is a separate language family. and Onge and Jarawa constitute another\u00a0language family.\u00a0\u00a0Before me, some linguists had traveled to the Andaman Islands, and they had always considered Andamanese as one language family, which had three\u00a0branches \u2014 Great Andamanese, Onge, and Jawara. Which I denied. That there are no such branches \u2014 there\u00a0are two independent language families."},{"author":"Bose","text":"I\u2019m going to pause here. For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with historical linguistics, it\u2019s a little like archaeology. But instead of excavating through dirt, a linguist separates layers of a language to uncover the different stages of evolution. And that\u2019s what Anvita decided she was going to do."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"Subseqently,\u00a0I reached the Andaman Islands with\u2014fully equipped with my gear for deciding, deciphering the, you know, the unknown language in 2005."},{"author":"Bose","text":"She stayed with people she had met, including Nao Jr., and collected more than 150 Great Andamanese names for different fish species and 109 for birds. But Anvita still couldn\u2019t understand the grammar and the linguistic structure of this language family. It was unlike anything she had ever encountered before. So British officials, while figuring out that the Andamanese languages were a little bit like chain links, in that neighboring tribes could understand each other, had also failed to understand it. This\u00a0fancy comparative lexicon published by a British military administrator in 1887 didn\u2019t help, either."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Then Abbi had what she thought was an innocuous conversation with Nao Jr."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"I asked him to tell me the word for blood. He looked at me as if I were an utter fool..., abut I resisted. He said, \u201cTell me where it is coming from.\u201d I replied, \u201cFrom nowhere,\u201d because I just wanted the word, meaning just one word: blood. He got irritated. And he repeated his sentence."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"He says, \u201cWhere did it come from, tell me?\u201d So I just made up, and I said, \u201cOn the finger....\u201d The moment I said that, he immediately said, \u201cOh, that will be called ongtei.\u201d And then he ratted off several words for blood on different parts of [the] body. If the blood emerged from the feet or legs, it was otei. If it\u2019s internal, it was etai\u2014it was a clot on the skin, it was ertei. Something as basic as a noun changed forms because of its location."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Basically, Anvita realized that the entire grammatical structure of this ancient language family changed depending on the zones of the body."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"I realized that it was changing its form several times because every word every open-class word, as we know in grammar, was prefixed by some of the body division markers."},{"author":"Bose","text":"To explain, while in English we might say, \u201cShe heads the company\u201d or \u201cWe face the window,\u201d But great Andamanese use body parts even more and to describe everything. Anvita divided the lexicon into two classes: free and bound. Words that were free occurred alone\u2014such as the word ra for pig. But words that were bound, nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, all existed with relation to other objects\u2014specifically, parts of the body."},{"author":"Abbi:'","text":"And body division markers were seven of them."},{"author":"Bose","text":"You might wonder why this is so significant.\u00a0Because no other known language family has a grammar based on the human body, Great Andamanese actually constitutes its own family.\u00a0According to genetic evidence, the Great Andamanese lived in isolation for tens of thousands of years. Anvita realized that the grammar she decoded meant that this original language family came from a time when people conceptualized the whole world through the body."},{"author":"Abbi","text":"The most beautiful aspect of the language, that it is, the whole grammar is anthropocentrism. It is\u2014depends upon how people perceive the world through their body: every activity, every modification, and every object is seen through the body. Only those which are natural forces, are natural elements like words and fauna and flora, they don\u2019t have these prefixes."},{"author":"Bose","text":"That gives us insight into early humans\u2014and a worldview where everything that happens is connected to everything else.\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0take you back to Papua New Guinea, to the famous cultural show in the highlands. We asked some people at the festival if they could speak to us in their language."},{"author":"Harper","text":"What about nice to meet you?"},{"author":"Villagers","text":"Kande!"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Like the Great Andamanese, some tribes in Papua New Guinea have lived in isolation for years. But its linguistic diversity is still under threat. In fact, most of the thousands of languages that may go extinct in the next century are Indigenous.\u00a0Nao Jr. left this world in February 2009. In his untimely death, he took with him a treasure trove of knowledge that can never be resurrected. I\u2019ll leave you with these words from Anvita\u2019s article: \u201cWhen the older generation can no longer teach the tongue to the younger ones, a language is doomed."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And with every language lost, we lose a wealth of knowledge about human existence, perception, nature and survival.\u201c For Science, Quickly, I\u2019m Tulika Bose.
