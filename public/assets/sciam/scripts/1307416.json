You\u2019re listening to part two of our Friday Fascination miniseries all about Antarctica. [CLIP: Theme music] Last week we met award-winning Brazilian journalist Sofia Moutinho onboard a U.S. icebreaker called the Nathaniel B. Palmer. Today we\u2019ll follow her as she and her fellow passengers hit the ice\u2014literally disembarking onto one of the many ice floes that drift through the Southern Ocean. They\u2019ll have to navigate tricky terrain and frigid temperatures to collect samples of pristine ice, which is crucial for helping scientists figure out how the world\u2019s waterways will change as our warming climate melts this region\u2019s glaciers and ice shelves. But before we get into all that science\u2014and the hard work that makes it possible\u2014Sofia has some new friends to introduce us to."},{"author":"Tara Williams","text":"It\u2019s bowing [laughs]!"},{"author":"Kouba","text":"It\u2019s just so much gratitude. It\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s once in a lifetime, these things. I just\u2014oh, my God [cries louder]!"},{"author":"Sofia Moutinho (tape)","text":"Are you crying?"},{"author":"Kouba","text":"I just\u2014I\u2019m absolutely crying!"},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"You cried, too, right?"},{"author":"Williams","text":"Yes, a few times [cries and laughs at the same time]. It\u2019s just beautiful and amazing, and who gets to see this?"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"It\u2019s the night before Christmas Eve in 2023. The austral summer sun shines behind gray clouds. An endless, thick layer of ice surrounds the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a U.S. icebreaker. It has only been a few hours since our ship rammed into the fast ice so we could disembark. Fast ice is the technical term for this frozen seawater connected to the shoreline. Our gangway is down, and a group of researchers is out on the ice. They will spend hours outside sampling sea ice to understand how its melting is affecting the chemistry and physics of the ocean as well as Earth\u2019s climate. But with hard work comes feathered rewards. You just heard the researchers crying with joy after an unexpected encounter with local wildlife."},{"author":"Williams","text":"I don\u2019t even have words."},{"author":"Teagan Bellitto","text":"I\u2019m so happy they came over."},{"author":"Williams","text":"My face hurts from smiling so much."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"\u201cThey\u201d were Ad\u00e9lie penguins, the smallest penguin species in the Antarctic. The researchers had been sampling for a little more than an hour, collecting snow from the surface and drilling ice cores with noisy machines, when we saw a line of black dots a few miles away, behind the ship. The shapes were moving quickly toward us."},{"author":"Ken Block","text":"There are a lot of penguins over there! Moutinho (tape): Yes, there\u2019s, like, 100 penguins coming this way!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Soon enough we realized it was a group of Ad\u00e9lies. They moved across the ice in a huge line\u2014some walking clumsily, others sliding on their belly."},{"author":"Laura Whitmore","text":"Oh, my gosh!"},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"Did you see that? There\u2019s like 100 of them!"},{"author":"Whitmore: ","text":"The penguins are coming! Oh, my gosh!"},{"author":"Other researchers","text":"Oh, my gosh!"},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"It\u2019s the March of the Penguins!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"They went around the ship and straight to the spot where the researchers were sampling. They were so close to us that we could touch them if we were allowed to. The scientists had no choice but to stop their work and admire the visitors, who boldly walked all around their equipment. [CLIP: Penguins make noise while researchers look on and take photographs]"},{"author":"Moutinho: ","text":"The gang of penguins squawked, honked, waved their wings and inspected every hole on the ice. The animals had a special admiration for the scientists\u2019 shovels. Some looked like they wanted to mate with the tools. One of them jumped into a plastic slide that the scientists use to carry equipment and just wouldn\u2019t leave it. [CLIP: Penguin noises]"},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"We\u2019re not supposed to interfere with the penguins, right? So if they come, we kind of have to just let them be there."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"That\u2019s Laura Whitmore, a chemical oceanographer at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and leader of ice operations on the Palmer. Because of that her colleagues nicknamed her \u201cthe Ice Queen.\u201d"},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"While we\u2019re doing the work, I would rather them not be right in our sampling area. We\u2019re trying to get clean samples, and penguins are pretty dirty [laughs]."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"While we had never seen so many penguins on the ice before, this was not our only encounter with them. These birds greeted us practically every time we stopped to collect samples during our journey in West Antarctica. This was Laura\u2019s first trip to Antarctica. She usually studies ice in the Arctic, where there are no penguins, and she was surprised by how curious these birds are."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"The first floe we were on, they came right up to us, and I just think their behavior\u2014coming close to people\u2014was the first surprising thing. And then they did it again. It\u2019s like, \u201cThis is just their behavior. They\u2019re going to come up to us.\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Just before our penguin encounter, I asked Laura about her expectations for our time on the ice that night. She couldn\u2019t have known what was about to happen, but what she said proved prophetic."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"I have a friend who always says, \u201cAnother day on the ice is another day in paradise,\u201d which is pretty true."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"But even in this icy paradise, it\u2019s easy to break a sweat. Sampling on ice is physically demanding, in part because it\u2019s super hard to walk across the surface, especially wearing three layers of thick clothes. I kept sinking into the snow and falling down. So did the scientists."},{"author":"Bellitto","text":"I fell in a nice little snow patch there\u2014like, a deep hole\u2014on my way here. And I was like, \u201cYou know, I thought I was going to be so graceful.\u201d"},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"You thought that?"},{"author":"Bellitto","text":"Yeah, I like to be optimistic."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The whole process of finding ice to sample is also hard. [CLIP: \u201cHandwriting,\u201d by Frank Jonsson] While it was easy for the penguins to find us on the ice every time we left the ship, finding the right sea ice was much more difficult for the humans. Thick ice floes often surrounded the ship. Thousands of them were spread across the ocean surface like gigantic pieces of an incoherent puzzle. As the ship moved, their huge masses hit the hull, making thunderlike sounds. [CLIP: Ice floes knock against the hull of the ship]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The researchers needed to find an ice floe that was sturdy enough for us to step on but not so thick that the top was out of reach from the small inflatable boat we used to navigate around the floating ice. The floe also had to be positioned in a spot where the wind would not blow it against the hull or throw the ship\u2019s smoke into the ice, contaminating the samples. The brightness was another challenge. Light reflecting off ice floes makes them look flat, even if they aren\u2019t. It was difficult to see if there were ridges, cracks or areas of uneven ground. Every time we went on an ice hunt, Laura and the marine technicians onboard spent up to six hours on the bridge looking through the big windows for a good piece of sea ice. They were armed with binoculars and patience. [CLIP: Background music]"},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"We\u2019re just going to kind of keep on going to the next bits of ice and keep looking."},{"author":"Heather Jackson","text":"To find a better favorite."},{"author":"Moutinho (tape)","text":"Window-shopping for ice."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"Yeah [laughs], literally, through the windows. [CLIP: Jackson hums the music playing on the bridge]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Heather Jackson is the person humming with Laura. She is a marine technician with the U.S. Antarctic Program. Her job is to help the researchers onboard the Palmer find a good piece of ice and keep them safe once they land on it."},{"author":"Jackson","text":"Sea-ice work is a slow process, and it moves at a glacial pace sometimes."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Heather, Laura and another marine technician, Stuart Siddons, often had long discussions before choosing which ice floe to inspect more closely."},{"author":"Stuart Siddons","text":"That one\u2019s a good option."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"When the researchers found a good candidate, they put on orange flotation suits that covered their whole body. The suits are thick enough to protect against the cold and will float if someone falls in the water. Then we went down from the Palmer using a Jacob\u2019s ladder\u2014a rustic ladder made out of ropes and planks\u2014hanging on the side of the hull."},{"author":"Siddons","text":"Okay, come on down!"},{"author":"Henry Thoreen","text":"You\u2019re the next contestant. Two more steps. One\u2014okay. [CLIP: Something hits the floor of a boat]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"We jumped into a Zodiac, a small inflatable motorboat."},{"author":"Siddons (on the radio)","text":"Bridge, bridge, Zodiac Two away at nine."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"To good science!"},{"author":"Technician (on the radio)","text":"Roger that, Zodiac Two away at nine.

We drove around the floe while the researchers checked if the ice was stable. When the team found a promising spot, the pilot inched the Zodiac up onto the ice.

[CLIP: Thoreen continues to poke the ground]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The snow can be misleading. Sometimes it is too fluffy to walk on. Other times it hides a layer of unstable, slushy ice."},{"author":"Thoreen: ","text":"Oh, this is nice and stable."},{"author":"Moutinho and researchers (tape)","text":"Woo-hoo!"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The researchers carried their heavy equipment onto the ice."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"The tubes, the shovels, the buckets. [CLIP: People walk through the snow]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Everyone also brought a personal dry bag with food, water, extra pairs of winter clothes and a bottle to pee in if necessary. We would be on the ice for up to six hours, so nature just might call. But tinkling on an ice floe in Antarctica isn\u2019t exactly straightforward. Diane Hutt, a U.S. Antarctic Program field supervisor, explained why during a safety training onboard."},{"author":"Diane Hutt","text":"You can pee into the water, but here\u2019s the problem with that, right? Like, you can\u2019t really hang off the side of the floe. You don\u2019t want to get too close to the edge, right?"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Walking\u2014or peeing\u2014on floating ice in a rough environment such as the Antarctic has risks. We were totally exposed to the harsh weather, wild animals such as leopard seals that could easily beat a human in a fight and the chance that the ice floe would break. For emergencies the researchers always carried survival kits."},{"author":"Jackson","text":"Inside the survival kits are things like\u2014there\u2019s some tents in there. There are food and provisions. There\u2019s a stove. There\u2019s water. There\u2019s warm sleeping bags. There\u2019s, like, a first aid kit. So that\u2014each bag is good for two people to be on land for three days. We send them out any time we\u2019re going to be in remote areas with the possibility that we might get stuck because of weather and that we might inadvertently have to spend a night somewhere away from the ship."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Ready for anything the researchers started their work. They used shovels to dig holes big enough to fit a person. [CLIP: The researchers dig in the snow]"},{"author":"Chris Marsay","text":"It\u2019s pretty compacted snow."},{"author":"Allison Laubach","text":"It is a little hard for a plastic shovel."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"Then they put a big drill inside one of the holes to retrieve a three-foot-long piece of ice. [CLIP: The researchers drill into the ice]"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The work is repetitive: drilling cores, taking their temperatures, packing them and moving them to the Zodiac using plastic slides. These ice cores capture the seasonal ice that is formed in a year. Laura will melt them onboard and analyze the water later in the lab back home. [CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson] By looking at what chemical elements are present and in what concentrations, she can learn what the ice is dumping into the ocean as it melts. She can also estimate how much sea ice is melting and how this could impact the Southern Ocean that encircles Antarctica\u2014and potentially other oceans around the world, too. West Antarctica has been melting more and more rapidly in recent decades because of climate change. Changes in wind patterns are allowing more warm water to reach the region\u2019s ice, and it\u2019s melting the ice shelves from below. Not long after we got back from the cruise earlier this year, satellites registered an alarming low in Antarctic sea ice during the Southern Hemisphere summer for the third year in a row. According to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, the extent of ice floating around the continent diminished to an area the size of Mexico. This was the second-lowest Antarctic sea ice extent ever recorded by satellites. The Antarctic has seen five of its lowest extents on record since 2017."},{"author":"Whitmore: ","text":"One of the things we\u2019re trying to find out is \u201cHow does that melt influence the ocean near Antarctica?\u201d and then \u201cDoes it have the potential to influence the oceans beyond Antarctica?\u201d"},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"When seawater freezes, the salt molecules do not fit in the ice\u2019s crystal structure. The ice expels those salts as brine, which is heavier than the surrounding seawater and sinks. That means the ice is largely made of freshwater. So when the ice melts it creates a sort of \u201ccap\u201d of relatively fresh and buoyant water on the surface. The cap can block water circulation into the depths."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"When you have that stratified layer, if it gets strong enough, it can influence how easily water from the surface mixes downward."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The process of dense water moving from the ocean surface to the bottom is called deepwater formation. It naturally occurs in only a few places on Earth, including a couple of the seas around Antarctica. It is extremely important because when the water moves down to the deep ocean, it carries dissolved materials, including carbon dioxide\u2014the main gas driving global warming. This process stores carbon in the ocean\u2019s deep waters for long periods of time."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"If you have waters that are sinking relatively quickly, you move a lot of carbon from that surface into the deepwater. But if you slow down the rate that the waters are sinking, or the amount of water that is sinking, you then can affect the amount of gaseous carbon that is going down with it."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"The Ross Sea, a deep bay of the Southern Ocean that neighbors the Amundsen Sea, is an area where deepwater forms and stores carbon. But as ice melting accelerates in the west, this process could be at risk."},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"So if there\u2019s a lot of glacial melt in the Amundsen, where this warm deepwater comes up and is melting glaciers and sea ice, and then that water moves into this other region of deepwater formation, it can potentially inhibit that formation."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"One recent study indicates the influx of meltwater could end the formation of deepwater in the Ross Sea by the 2050s. Sea ice is also important for the local ecosystem, as the penguins have shown us. [CLIP: Penguin noises] Remember Rob Sherrell, one of the Palmer scientists we met in Episode One? He explains that sea ice is both a habitat and a food source for local animals."},{"author":"Sherrell","text":"The whole ecosystem has gotten used to the timing of seasonal sea ice, to the point where seals absolutely depend on it being there. That\u2019s where they give birth and do reproduction. Some of the species of penguins absolutely rely on sea ice, either because they need a platform to hunt from or because their young feed on baby krill that are themselves feeding on the phytoplankton embedded in the bottom of the sea ice."},{"author":"Moutinho: ","text":"Sea-ice melting also affects the tiny phytoplankton that we talked about in the first episode. These organisms are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding all sorts of animals and absorbing a fair share of atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. They live near the ocean\u2019s surface, where sunlight reaches. Rob explains that floating meltwater can prevent the phytoplankton from getting important nutrients that are present down below, including iron."},{"author":"Sherrell","text":"And you get a layer that\u2019s very hard to disturb. And so you have phytoplankton growing in this layer. And the supply of iron, which is almost entirely, we think, mixed up from below, can be shut off\u2014or largely shut off\u2014because it\u2019s hard to mix the water up through this very buoyant layer."},{"author":"Moutinho","text":"A lot of attention has been given to sea ice melting in the Arctic, which could become summer-sea-ice-free within a decade. But scientists remained uncertain about the impact of a warming climate on Antarctica for much longer. It will take more work from researchers as brave and inspired as the ones aboard the Palmer to get a better idea of what the future might hold. [CLIP: Theme music]"},{"author":"Whitmore","text":"I don\u2019t know exactly what would happen were there to be a loss of sea ice in the Antarctic, but, you know, we can be sure that it will impact the ecosystem from the bottom all the way to the top."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Join us again next Friday for a behind-the-scenes look at life onboard an icebreaker in Antarctica: What is it like working in such a harsh environment?
