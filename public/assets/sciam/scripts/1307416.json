[CLIP: Theme music] Last week we met award-winning Brazilian journalist Sofia Moutinho onboard a U.S. icebreaker called the Nathaniel B. Palmer. Today we\u2019ll follow her as she and her fellow passengers hit the ice\u2014literally disembarking onto one of the many ice floes that drift through the Southern Ocean. They\u2019ll have to navigate tricky terrain and frigid temperatures to collect samples of pristine ice, which is crucial for helping scientists figure out how the world\u2019s waterways will change as our warming climate melts this region\u2019s glaciers and ice shelves. But before we get into all that science\u2014and the hard work that makes it possible\u2014Sofia has some new friends to introduce us to."

It has only been a few hours since our ship rammed into the fast ice so we could disembark. Fast ice is the technical term for this frozen seawater connected to the shoreline. Our gangway is down, and a group of researchers is out on the ice. They will spend hours outside sampling sea ice to understand how its melting is affecting the chemistry and physics of the ocean as well as Earth\u2019s climate. But with hard work comes feathered rewards. You just heard the researchers crying with joy after an unexpected encounter with local wildlife."

[CLIP: \u201cHandwriting,\u201d by Frank Jonsson] While it was easy for the penguins to find us on the ice every time we left the ship, finding the right sea ice was much more difficult for the humans. Thick ice floes often surrounded the ship. Thousands of them were spread across the ocean surface like gigantic pieces of an incoherent puzzle. As the ship moved, their huge masses hit the hull, making thunderlike sounds. [CLIP: Ice floes knock against the hull of the ship]"

The floe also had to be positioned in a spot where the wind would not blow it against the hull or throw the ship\u2019s smoke into the ice, contaminating the samples. The brightness was another challenge. Light reflecting off ice floes makes them look flat, even if they aren\u2019t. It was difficult to see if there were ridges, cracks or areas of uneven ground. Every time we went on an ice hunt, Laura and the marine technicians onboard spent up to six hours on the bridge looking through the big windows for a good piece of sea ice.

[CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson] By looking at what chemical elements are present and in what concentrations, she can learn what the ice is dumping into the ocean as it melts. She can also estimate how much sea ice is melting and how this could impact the Southern Ocean that encircles Antarctica\u2014and potentially other oceans around the world, too. West Antarctica has been melting more and more rapidly in recent decades because of climate change. Changes in wind patterns are allowing more warm water to reach the region\u2019s ice, and it\u2019s melting the ice shelves from below. Not long after we got back from the cruise earlier this year, satellites registered an alarming low in Antarctic sea ice during the Southern Hemisphere summer for the third year in a row. According to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, the extent of ice floating around the continent diminished to an area the size of Mexico. This was the second-lowest Antarctic sea ice extent ever recorded by satellites. The Antarctic has seen five of its lowest extents on record since 2017."
