Now you can help name one of Earth\u2019s quasi-moons."],"authors":["Rachel Feltman","Fonda Mwangi"],"category":["Space Exploration"],"transcript":[{"author":"Rachel Feltman","text":"Most people know Latif Nasser as one of the hosts of Radiolab."},{"author":"Latif Nasser","text":"Hey! I\u2019m Latif Nasser. This is Radiolab."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But about a year and a half ago his nose for a good science story took him on a wild side quest\u2014and, yeah, it did end up turning into a really cool episode of Radiolab\u2014but Latif also found himself playing an active part in the scientific process. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. And today we\u2019re talking about the time Latif accidentally helped name a \u201cquasi-moon\u201d and how you\u2014yes, you\u2014can name a quasi-moon of your very own. We\u2019re lucky enough to have the man himself here today to tell us more. I would love to hear a little bit about how you got interested in quasi-moons\u2014or qway-zee moons, depending on who you ask."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Yeah, well, it started totally by accident. I was putting my kid to bed one night in his crib, and we had bought for him online this, like, solar system poster. And I was looking at the solar system poster sort of out of the corner of my eye as I was putting him in his crib, and I saw, like, that Venus had a moon, and I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cI never learned that in school: that Venus had a moon.\u201d I was like, \u201cAm I crazy?\u201d And then I looked it up. I just Googled on my phone, \u201cDoes Venus have a moon?\u201d And then the first result was from NASA, and it was like, \u201cVenus does not have a moon.\u201d And I was like, \u201cAm I crazy? Like, what is going on here?\u201d And then also, then I went back in, and I looked at it again the next morning, and it had a name, and the name was Z-O-O-Z-V-E, Zoozve, and then I Googled that, and there was nothing in English\u2014which, like, how many times do you Google something and there\u2019s nothing in English?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, pretty much never [laughs]."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Right? And I was like, \u201cThis is so weird. Like, it\u2019s too weird to be an accident. What happened here?\u201d And then, kind of long story short, I found that there actually is an object near Venus. It, it\u2019s not called Zoozve; it\u2019s called 2002 VE68. So the \u201c2002 VE,\u201d the illustrator, he misread his own writing, and he mistook the twos for z\u2019s, the zeros for o\u2019s, and so he called it Zoozve, but it was really 2002 VE. And this thing, it wasn\u2019t a moon of Venus; it was something called\u2014which I had never heard of before\u2014it was this thing that was called a quasi-moon\u2014or a qway-zee moon, exactly as you said\u2014and I was like, \u201cWhat even is that?\u201d This whole process was just me being like, \u201cWhat? I, I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d you know, one after another. And then finally I got it explained to me, which is that this is this sort of extraordinary, weird object where, unlike a moon and unlike a planet, it sort of does the things that both of those things do: [for example, a quasi-moon of Earth] orbits the sun, and while it\u2019s orbiting the sun, it also simultaneously orbits us. So it\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s too small and far out to technically be a moon of Earth, but it\u2019s orbiting the sun at almost exactly the same rate, and while it does so, sometimes it goes a little faster than us, sometimes it goes a little slower than us. [Then say we\u2019re now on Venus,] relative from where we are standing, if we look at it, it looks like it\u2019s going around us like a moon, but it\u2019s kind of doing this weird three-way dance between Venus, in that case, and the sun."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s really cool. It kind of makes me dizzy trying to think about it."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"It\u2019s totally\u2014it is a thing that you kind of have to imagine in three dimensions. And I\u2019ve needed many people to explain this to me many times."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what do we, or don\u2019t we, know about quasi-moons, and why are they important for us to learn about?"},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Well, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know. These things are so small\u2014relatively small\u2014like this one is the size of, like, the Eiffel Tower sort of thing, and it\u2019s, like, a gray, potato-shaped rock, but we don\u2019t know exactly what it looks like. But the thing that\u2019s kind of more interesting about it is its trajectory, and that\u2019s sort of the thing that people are sort of, like, trying to trace and figure out. The reason why it\u2019s interesting\u2014I think there\u2019s two reasons. One is for Zoozve\u2014it is our neighbor. Zoozve probably belonged to us as a sort of a quasi-moon. We were the ones who sort of flung it to Venus. It\u2019s in our neighborhood\u2014yeah, just like a weirdo wandering our neighborhood. Like, it\u2019s good to know, like, \u201cWho is this thing?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Nasser","text":"And then the second thing is, like, kind of the physics of it are really interesting\u2014so if people have heard of the three-body problem, like, this is kind of a three-body problem: Like, \u201cHow do you calculate where this thing has been, where it\u2019s gonna go?\u201d Because it\u2019s sort of\u2014mostly the sun is sort of the thing that\u2019s gravitationally pulling it, but also it has this tiny, teeny, tiny\u2014whatever planet it\u2019s nearest has this tiny, teeny toehold on it, and trying to compute those, like, three bodies and their trajectory on the future, it, like, gets very mysterious pretty quickly in a totally fascinating way."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"In particular, I encourage listeners to go check out the Radiolab episode about your saga investigating this quasi-moon, if they haven\u2019t already, but without spoiling kind of the highs and lows of the process, I would love to hear a little bit about your triumph in getting it named\u2014or, at least, getting its true name confirmed, since it clearly was meant to be Zoozve."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"[Laughs] I kind of went on this long rabbit hole about quasi-moons and about Zoozve. And I just kept, the whole time, I just kept calling it Zoozve. It felt weird not to call it Zoozve. And then we kind of got an idea towards the end of producing the episode of, like, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a name.\u201d Like, the name that it had, 2002 VE, is \u2019cause it was discovered in 2002 and a certain time, and it, it\u2019s almost like a license plate it was assigned or something, you know? And we were like, \u201cThis thing is eligible to be named.\u201d The guy who discovered it, who I found as part of the reporting, he didn\u2019t even know he discovered it. He was like, \u201cOh, I discovered that?\u201d Like, I, I surprised him. So he didn\u2019t really care about what it was named. So I was like, \u201cWait, what if we, like, officially submit this naming candidate of \u2018Zoozve\u2019? Like, it\u2019s funny and weird, and there\u2019s nothing else called Zoozve. Like, why not?\u201d Yeah, there was a lot of suspense \u2019cause there\u2019s a lot of rules around what you can name stuff in space, and especially if it\u2019s within a certain kind of radius of Earth, it typically has a mythological name\u2014you know, like Greek mythology or, like, like, that kind of thing\u2014and this obviously did not, but then there were very helpful people online who came and, and, like, wrote, like, faux mythology, like, retconned a mythology for Zoozve, which was very funny and cute. We submitted this name, and they, they chose it\u2014they approved the name, which we were completely, completely shocked that they did that. But, yeah, they named it, and it was so fun, and so now there will be forever a thing called Zoozve. And even when I told the illustrator, whose typo, basically, it was, he was, like, totally shocked, and he was like, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Zoozve tattoo.\u201d [Laughs]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] That\u2019s incredible."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s been pretty great."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I would probably have mixed feelings about my typo being immortalized in that way, but I think he should feel really good about it [laughs]."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"[Laughs] He took it in the right spirit, I think. He took it in the right spirit."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Good, good. And, yes, speaking of naming quasi-moons, I understand that you\u2019ve convinced the powers that be, when it comes to naming these objects, that they should let some other folks in on the action, so why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about that?"},{"author":"Nasser","text":"We, at Radiolab, we had so much fun helping to name this quasi-moon of Venus, and we were like, \u201cWhy not do it again, and let everyone in on the action?\u201d So we, basically, once we learned all these, like, you know, esoteric rules about naming objects in the solar system ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"No Moon McMoonface ..."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"No Moony McMoonface, apparently. I mean, I like that name, but that\u2019s not on the table. But so we asked them, we approached the [International Astronomical Union]\u2014or in my head, I call them the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d; they\u2019re the people who, like, are in charge of naming everything\u2014and I was like, \u201cHey, could we do, like, a big public contest? \u2019Cause there are a bunch of Earth quasi-moons that haven\u2019t been named. Let\u2019s all name one together\u2014but of Earth this time.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Miraculously they agreed, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing: we\u2019re doing this kind of, like, giant global contest where, basically until the end of September, for the next few months, people can submit names. It\u2019s a very simple form. You just kind of, like, submit your name, and you talk about, you know, what it\u2014the name means and maybe what, what mythology it comes from and why you think it\u2019s a good name. And then we\u2019ll, like, narrow it down to about 10 candidate names over the month of October, and then for November and December it\u2019ll be, like, a fan vote, so people will be able to vote for whatever name they like. And then, basically, in January we\u2019re going to announce the new official name of this quasi-moon of Earth, determined by the people of Earth!"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] That\u2019s awesome. And, yeah, what do we know about the quasi-moon in question?"},{"author":"Nasser","text":"The thing that makes this one really special and the reason I, you know, we chose this one was its orbit. So, like, these quasi-moons, because they\u2019re being acted on by the sun, mostly, but then also a tiny bit by the Earth, like, they do these really beautiful, strange orbits that I, for one, like, I never thought was possible. I never thought anything could move in space like that, like, in this weird 3D\u2014it\u2019s not just an ellipse, you know, like you always picture. It\u2019s doing all kinds of wobbly\u2014like, you look at it from this angle, it looks like a butterfly; you look at it from this angle, it looks like a saddle or like a spirograph or like a\u2014it just looks like\u2014you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat the heck is\u2014I don\u2019t even know what words to use to describe the shape.\u201d So it\u2019s kind of a weirdo, and I was like, \u201cOh, I want the weirdest one. Let\u2019s pick the weirdest one.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Yeah, so that\u2019s what we did."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Awesome."},{"author":"Nasser","text":"Its tentative name, its current name is 2004 GU9, or its other kind of asteroid official number is asteroid 164207. But it\u2019s not in the asteroid belt; it\u2019s near us."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Very cool. What are you hoping that folks take away from getting involved in this process?"},{"author":"Nasser","text":"To me, I think, like, I don\u2019t know, the news is so bleak at the moment, with, you know, like, war and politics and lies and this thing and that thing, and there\u2019s just so much that\u2019s really bleak going on, and I just want some, like, sweet, nerdy fun for the whole world, something we can do together no matter what we disagree about everything else\u2014like, this is just, like, a mission we can all go on together, a kind of silly mission but, like, kind of one that will help us zoom out and pick a name that\u2019ll outlive us all, you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. I love that. That\u2019s great. Okay, listeners. Now\u2019s your big chance to make your mark on the cosmos. From now through September you can submit your quasi-moon name ideas at Radiolab.org/moon. If you\u2019re not feeling inspired, you can still pitch in\u2014just check back in November to vote for your favorites. That\u2019s all for today, but we\u2019ll be back on Friday with a deep dive into a particularly murky topic: the Seine. Specifically we\u2019re talking about the billion-dollar initiative to make it safe to swim in for competitors in the 2024 Olympics. Are these efforts pure hubris, or is urban-river swimming actually set to make a comeback in cities worldwide? Tune in on Friday to find out.

And I was like, \u201cThis is so weird. Like, it\u2019s too weird to be an accident. What happened here?\u201d And then, kind of long story short, I found that there actually is an object near Venus. It, it\u2019s not called Zoozve; it\u2019s called 2002 VE68. So the \u201c2002 VE,\u201d the illustrator, he misread his own writing, and he mistook the twos for z\u2019s, the zeros for o\u2019s, and so he called it Zoozve, but it was really 2002 VE.

I, I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d you know, one after another. And then finally I got it explained to me, which is that this is this sort of extraordinary, weird object where, unlike a moon and unlike a planet, it sort of does the things that both of those things do: [for example, a quasi-moon of Earth] orbits the sun, and while it\u2019s orbiting the sun, it also simultaneously orbits us. So it\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s too small and far out to technically be a moon of Earth, but it\u2019s orbiting the sun at almost exactly the same rate, and while it does so, sometimes it goes a little faster than us, sometimes it goes a little slower than us. [Then say we\u2019re now on Venus,] relative from where we are standing, if we look at it, it looks like it\u2019s going around us like a moon, but it\u2019s kind of doing this weird three-way dance between Venus, in that case, and the sun."]},{"begin":"237.560","end":"240.320","lines":["That\u2019s really cool.
