I\u2019m Tanya Lewis."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m Josh Fischman."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"We\u2019re Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Today, we are delving into the disease originally known as \u201cchronic fatigue syndrome.\u201d Now it\u2019s called ME/CFS. Recently, a big study looked at people who got the illness after an infection, and it turned up a few clues about what might be causing their debilitating, often lifelong symptoms. [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The disease once called chronic fatigue syndrome has historically been dismissed by doctors and other health care professionals as a psychosomatic illness, without any real physiological causes. But in recent years, researchers have begun to take the disease\u2014whose official full name is now myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short \u2014more seriously."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That really is a mouthful, and I\u2019m not even going to try it. But Tanya, what does it mean?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Well, it comes from myalgia, which means muscle pain, and encephalomyelitis, which is inflammation of the brain and spinal cord due to an infection. And while it\u2019s sometimes referred to as just chronic fatigue syndrome, people with ME/CFS prefer to call it ME, because it\u2019s really more than just fatigue."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And during the COVID pandemic, millions of people developed something that was very, very similar to ME/CFS, and that\u2019s long COVID. So, scientists started taking that a lot more seriously. Even before the pandemic, I know the National Institutes of Health was starting to study ME/CFS."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s right. So Francis Collins, who was the director of NIH at the time, approached a scientist named Avindra Nath and asked him to launch a comprehensive study of people with ME/CFS to really try to find some clues as to what was causing their exhausting symptoms."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Yeah, like you said in addition to fatigue, there\u2019s a whole bunch of other very serious problems."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"People with ME/CFS often experience brain fog, hypersensitivity to light and short-term memory problems. And another really common issue is something called post-exertional malaise\u2014it\u2019s basically a worsening of your symptoms after any kind of physical activity. And there aren\u2019t really good treatments for it."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019ve known some people with ME/CFS, and it can be really devastating."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, it really can. So starting in 2016, Avi and his colleagues set out to study this, but since ME/CFS is sort of an umbrella term for a wide array of disease forms, they wanted to find a group of people who fit a very specific patient profile. They specifically recruited people who had developed the disease after an infection, and they also had to be well enough to travel to NIH for the experiments. They ended up with a total of 17 participants with ME/CFS, and 21 healthy volunteers. Next, they set about putting the participants through a whole series of tests of pretty much every organ system."},{"author":"Avindra Nath: ","text":"I'm Avi Nath. I'm the clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and also the chief of the section of infections of the nervous system. We did a very thorough investigation, looking at MRI scans, cognitive function. We did spinal taps, lots of blood draws at various time points. We looked at the immune function, metabolomics. We looked at the gut microbiome, we looked at their heart rates and blood pressures and autonomic function."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I know that it was a really complete workup. What did they find?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"A lot of this is described in an online news story by writer Kamal Nahas, which we\u2019ll link to in the transcript. Here\u2019s Avi:"},{"author":"Nath","text":"We found that there were multiple systems that were involved. There wasn't a single abnormal observation. We found that there were a number of abnormalities. One, we found that there was activation of the immune system in the ME/CFS patients."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It was almost like the immune system was \u201cexhausted\u201d from being chronically activated."},{"author":"Nath","text":"And, interestingly, we found that there were differences between men and women, such that women had predominantly B cell pathways that were activated, and in men, it was predominantly T cells. And so that in itself is a very important observation because it tells us that what may work for women may not work for men."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"ME/CFS occurs predominantly in women, but men can obviously get it too, so treatment could look for different for men vs. women. The researchers also found differences in the brains and nervous systems of people with ME/CFS."},{"author":"Nath","text":"We found a lot abnormalities in the metabolites and the neurotransmitters. We tested the brain in many different ways by stimulating the brains with transcranial magnetic stimulation and a functional MRI scan, whereby you can look at the metabolism of the brain in a resting state and when you exercise the brain. In order to exercise the brain, we did a simple motor task. We found that the motor cortex itself was fine, but there\u2019s an area of the brain that integrates all the information together, and it\u2019s at the junction of the temporal and parietal lobe. And we found that that was inactive. And it\u2019s not a structural abnormality, it\u2019s a functional abnormality."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Avi says this functional brain abnormality might explain the post-exertional malaise many people with ME/CFS experience. But it\u2019s a pretty preliminary finding."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Right, that doesn\u2019t really seem like it would explain the whole story."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right, probably not. I actually talked to one of the study participants, a journalist named Brian Vastag."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Oh, Brian is actually a friend of mine. He\u2019s the reason NIH started doing this study because he wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post complaining that scientists weren\u2019t studying ME/CFS enough."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s really interesting. I know he\u2019s been a big t activist for people with ME/CFS."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I've known Brian for a long time. I've known him before he got sick and after he got sick. And, I can tell you it's made a huge difference in his life. He was a great journalist. And then he couldn't do that anymore. He's a really bright, very curious, and very intelligent person. And all of a sudden he just didn't have this body that would let him follow through with the things that he wanted to find out about. Because, you know, he just didn't have the physical ability. It was kind of like having this really bright mind locked in this body that wouldn't work anymore. And, he doesn't really know what caused it."},{"author":"Brian Vastag","text":"I had a sudden fever, you know, basically went from being well to being sick in, like, five minutes. It was very stark."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"He had a false positive test for West Nile virus, but they never actually found the true pathogen. And I asked him what he thought about the study."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Brian wasn\u2019t too thrilled about the study results Nath was talking about before."},{"author":"Vastag","text":"The findings were pretty meager, I'm just so conflicted about how the study turned out."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, I mean, he\u2019s glad they did the study, but he didn\u2019t really think it found a whole lot that was new. He also took issue with the fMRI findings, which he thought was not an appropriate test and was only based on a handful of participants. Overall, though, the study may have been too small to draw strong conclusions. That said, he did think the study helps validate that ME/CFS is a real illness, with real biological causes. And that\u2019s important, given that many doctors still dismiss people with the disease, and we don\u2019t really have that many treatments."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Ok, that\u2019s Brian. What about Avi? Does Avi think the study will help lead to potential treatments?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Avi, really hopes this will lead to treatments. Even though the study didn\u2019t find so-called \u201cautoantibodies,\u201d a sign that the body is attacking itself, like some studies have found. It did find signs of B and T cell wonkiness, if you will. And the treatments could depend on your sex. So, in women, you could try checkpoint inhibitors, which are used as a type of immunotherapy for cancer. And for men, perhaps you could try various T cell therapies,"},{"author":"Vastag","text":"They need to do treatment trials, like, that needs to be the next step. Patients are desperate and patients need treatment. And we can't just wait to figure out the entire pathophysiology, like we need to start."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"So researchers are already testing some of these therapies."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Well, I\u2019m glad to hear they\u2019re starting. But what about long Covid\u2014could this research benefit people with that?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, it might. There\u2019s certainly a lot more interest in these conditions now, given how many people have long Covid."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"That\u2019s really important because ME/CFS and long COVID both take a real toll. They ruin lives."},{"author":"Vastag","text":"I want people to know that this is a matter of life or death. You know, you try 100 different medicines, and nothing ever helps you. It's really hard to keep going. [CLIP: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Your Health, Quickly is produced by Timmy Broderick, Tulika Bose, Jeff DelViscio, and by us.
