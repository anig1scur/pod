No? Well, mathematicians sure have. In fact, it\u2019s a question they\u2019re still debating today."},{"author":"Kyne Santos","text":"You\u2019d think that\u2019s something they\u2019d have a handle on, but they really don\u2019t: Is math an aspect of nature that we\u2019re discovering, or is it an invention of the human mind?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman."},{"author":"Santos","text":"And I\u2019m Kyne Santos, your favorite math-teaching drag queen."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Last week Kyne came on the show to teach us just how beautiful math can be. This week we\u2019re getting to know who math is on the inside."},{"author":"Santos","text":"We\u2019ve talked about equations and numbers and theorems, but what really are those things? Are mathematicians like scientists, going out into the world to take measurements and form hypotheses? Or are they more like philosophers, who sit in an armchair and think?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Apparently no one knows?"},{"author":"Santos","text":"Well, there are definitely a couple different camps in this debate."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson]"},{"author":"Santos","text":"One school of thought is called intuitionism, which is the idea that math is all in our heads, and any mathematical truth is only true insofar as we believe that it\u2019s true."},{"author":"Mark Jago","text":"My take is that it just looks way too convenient if it was invented by us. I mean, if it was just invented by us, we\u2019d have to be pretty smart."},{"author":"Santos","text":"That\u2019s Mark Jago, the philosopher and logician from the University of Nottingham in England that we met in Episode One."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"This all feels very, like, The Matrix to me, which is probably why I didn\u2019t take any philosophy courses in undergrad."},{"author":"Santos","text":"It\u2019s not a bad comparison, actually. Intuitionism is very \u201cthere is no spoon.\u201d It treats math as subjective, and mathematical concepts only come to exist when people put their heads together to create a shared experience of math."},{"author":"","text":"Mark also explained some ways that math might exist without us creating it."},{"author":"Jago","text":"On the other hand, if you think of maths as something out there, kind of like the physical world but separate from it, we don\u2019t have to kind of think of ourselves as having superhuman abilities\u2014just good enough abilities to work stuff out. And I think that kind of explains how we can keep on discovering new bits of maths. Like, you\u2019re never going to find out all of it."},{"author":"Santos","text":"Mark is talking about another major school of thought: a form of realism called Platonism, which is the idea that math exists as something that\u2019s just\u2014out there. We humans may invent the symbols for addition and multiplication, the digits we use to represent numbers, and so on. But once we agree on which symbols to use, the rules and consequences sort of fall into place because we\u2019re representing something that already exists. Like, we can change the numerals that represent the numbers 2 and 4, but there\u2019s no changing the fact that 2 + 2 = 4. Platonism holds that there\u2019s something innately true about that."},{"author":"","text":"We could come up with rules for math that seem true to us but are fundamentally false because they contradict whatever the abstract concept of math is doing\u2014somewhere out there. It\u2019s sort of like how we treat time as this fundamental thing, even though it\u2019s invisible, and we use a bunch of human-made constructs to try and understand it."},{"author":"Jago","text":"An opposing view says there\u2019s no reality to it at all, whether out there or up to us. It\u2019s just kind of in the language. So there are the number words, and we kind of shuffle these around on paper when we\u2019re doing maths, but there\u2019s really nothing more to it than that."},{"author":"Santos","text":"That view is called formalism. To formalists, math is like a logic game, and the goal is to avoid contradictions. For example, we know that an integer that\u2019s both even and odd at the same time doesn\u2019t exist because that would be a contradiction. To formalists, a mathematical object \u201cexists\u201d if its existence doesn\u2019t cause any logical contradictions."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So\u2014formalists believe that you can just manipulate things into being true by using clever math proofs?"},{"author":"Santos","text":"Exactly. Mark isn\u2019t a fan of that view, but he admits that it avoids a whole can of worms."},{"author":"Jago","text":"If you think that maths is real out there in the world, you\u2019ve got to kind of explain: Where is it, and how did it get there? And how do we find out about it if it\u2019s not, like, a physical thing? They\u2019re really difficult questions to answer."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cHandwriting, by Frank Jonsson]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Okay, I think I need to call a time-out so we can do a quick recap on all of these possible realities of math."},{"author":"Santos","text":"So Platonists believe that math is a fixture of objective reality and that its existence has nothing to do with us\u2014we can only try to discover the abstract objects involved. Intuitionists believe math is only in our heads, and mathematical objects only exist if we can imagine them. Formalists are somewhere in the middle, believing that we make up the basic rules but that the theorems and discoveries fall into place as a result, even if we can\u2019t imagine or understand them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, that\u2019s a lot to keep track of, let alone debate."},{"author":"Santos","text":"You\u2019re not wrong. And mathematicians have been debating this stuff for a long time. Most mathematicians nowadays fall under the formalist camp, which says that all of math can be built out of a correct system of axioms."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Axioms sound vaguely familiar, but it\u2019s been a while since my last math class. So, can I get a refresher?"},{"author":"Santos","text":"Absolutely. Axioms are statements that don\u2019t need to be proven because they\u2019re assumed to be true or self-evident. An example might be: \u201cA statement cannot be both true and not true at the same time in the same respect.\u201d Or another axiom might be: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to draw a straight line between one point and any other point.\u201d"},{"author":"Eugenia Cheng","text":"An axiom is a starting point in mathematics. And so math is trying to build everything up using just logic, but you have to have something to start with because logic is based on the concept of implication, which means: \u201cIf this is true, then this other thing has to be true.\u201d"},{"author":"Santos","text":"That\u2019s Eugenia Cheng, a mathematician, author and scientist in residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago."},{"author":"Cheng","text":"It\u2019s a bit like the idea of cooking from scratch in the kitchen, right? You have to start with some ingredients; otherwise you won\u2019t get anywhere. And so the axioms are like the ingredients that you start with, the things that you\u2019re going to assume that you have already, and then see what you can deduce."},{"author":"","text":"And it doesn\u2019t mean that those axioms are true; it means you\u2019re going to explore a world in which those axioms are true and see what else must also be true. So it\u2019s like saying, \u201cIf you have butter and flour and water in your kitchen, you can definitely make pastry,\u201d which doesn\u2019t mean everyone can make pastry, but it does mean that if you have butter and flour and water, you can make pastry\u2014even if it\u2019s not very good pastry the first time you do it."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cThe Farmhouse,\u201d by Silver Maple]"},{"author":"Santos","text":"More than 2,000 years ago, an ancient Greek mathematician known as Euclid wrote the most famous math textbook of all time, called Elements, and he started with five axioms, also known as postulates."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Let\u2019s hear \u2019em."},{"author":"Santos","text":"Number one: it is possible to draw a straight line between any two points. Two: it\u2019s possible to extend a straight line indefinitely in both directions. Three: it\u2019s possible to draw a circle with any center point and any radius. Four: all right angles are equal to each other. And the fifth, which is a little difficult to visualize, so nowadays we often describe it using this equivalent postulate, which says, on a plane, if you have a line and a point not on the line, then you can draw, at most, one line that goes through the point and is parallel to the original line."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, that fifth one really does come out of nowhere."},{"author":"Santos","text":"Yep, well, don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need to go too deep into it. What\u2019s important is that, starting with those five axioms as his ingredients, Euclid goes on to prove the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the angles in a triangle, the volume of a pyramid, the properties of circles\u2014pretty much all of what we consider to be basic geometry. And we can trace it all back to Euclid\u2019s five axioms."},{"author":"","text":"Fast-forward to the 1920s, and a leading formalist mathematician named David Hilbert thought that with the right set of axioms and rules, the right ingredients, he could describe all of math. So he put it out there as an open problem, and this is referred to as Hilbert\u2019s program."},{"author":"","text":"Two mathematicians, Kurt G\u00f6del and Alan Turing, put a bit of a damper on Hilbert\u2019s dream. They proved that any formal system of axioms would have limits on what it could prove. Some mathematical questions will have to go on being unsolved and unproven."},{"author":"Jago","text":"These are both results that tell us something about the limits of maths\u2014or rather the limits of what automatic reasoning, the kind of thing that a computer can do or that, that you can do if you follow a test\u2014like if you have a set of instructions that tell you how to calculate something, and they\u2019re always a fixed set of instructions."},{"author":"Santos","text":"Finding limits to what we can do in math, whether with the help of computers or through our own ingenuity, sounds like it should have been a huge problem. But it wasn\u2019t. The formalist school ended up winning over most mathematicians, and Hilbert\u2019s program gave birth to new branches of math. We\u2019ve come up with an axiomatic system that can be used to carry out almost all of math, which is called Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice. G\u00f6del and Turing may have shown that every axiom system has its limits, but in practice it makes no difference for the work of most mathematicians."},{"author":"Jago","text":"For me, you know, this doesn\u2019t say to me that there are problems with maths. It\u2019s like this country that stretches out beyond what we could ever hope to cover, what we could ever hope to discover. There\u2019s something exciting about that."},{"author":"Santos","text":"Eugenia recently wrote a book that looked at the question: \u201cIs math real?\u201d But she isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s the right question to ask."},{"author":"Cheng","text":"I think the right question is: \u201cIn what sense can we consider math to be real, and in what sense can we consider math not to be real?\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cRainshower,\u201d by Johannes Bornl\u00f6f]"},{"author":"Cheng","text":"I think sometimes people accuse math of not being real because mathematicians have just kind of made it up. And they say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. But I want to say that\u2019s a great thing. Isn\u2019t that amazing?"},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s like language: Is language real? Well, it\u2019s just something humans made up to communicate about the world around us. We just invented it, but it works. It enables us to communicate amazing things. The fact that it\u2019s made-up makes it particularly powerful because we can keep making up more of it, and we\u2019ll never run out of it as long as our brains don\u2019t run out of imagination."},{"author":"","text":"You know, with other stuff we invent, we run out of resources. We run out of money. We have to spend money buying equipment. We have to bug somebody else to give us money for things. Not with abstract math\u2014it\u2019s only limited by our imagination."},{"author":"Santos","text":"So we may not have a total consensus on the exact nature of math. But whatever it is, we can all agree that math works. We can use it to predict where trash will end up in the ocean. We can pinpoint a person\u2019s spot on the globe using satellites. And it\u2019s also fun, and maybe that\u2019s enough."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Join us next Friday for the final episode in our Fascination miniseries \u201cThe Hidden Nature of Math.\u201d Kyne, what mysteries will we dive into next time?"},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: Theme music]"},{"author":"Santos","text":"We\u2019re headed out to the bleeding edge of the field to look at all the math being discovered today\u2014and all the math we\u2019ve yet to find."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I can\u2019t wait.
