I\u2019m Emily Schwing. How do you fight an uphill battle\u00a0when the problem is moving downhill? That\u2019s exactly what Denali National Park\u2019s resident geologist\u00a0Denny Capps\u00a0is trying to figure out."},{"author":"Capps","text":": In recent years, the Pretty Rocks landslide transformed from a minor maintenance concern to really our foremost challenge."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": On a crisp\u00a0fall day in September, just inside the park entrance, not much is happening inside the offices. Staff here are a week out from buttoning up the park for winter. But more than 40 miles down the park\u2019s only road, at a place known as Pretty Rocks, things are really moving downhill, at up to a half an inch an hour."},{"author":"Paul Ollig","text":":\u00a0The Pretty Rocks landslide acts much more like a glacier than it does what most people consider to be a landslide."},{"author":"Schwing","text":":Paul Ollig is the director of interpretation and education at Denali."},{"author":"Ollig","text":":\u00a0In that it is this very ice-rich material that responds to fluctuations in temperature and will speed up and slow down based on a lot of different factors, regarding the level of the ice, the temperature of the ice. And so\u00a0we tend to consider the Pretty Rocks landslide to be more like a rock glacier than what we would typically consider to be a landslide."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": Ollig says the landslide is a harbinger of what else may come for the entire U.S. National Park System."},{"author":"Ollig","text":":\u00a0This is,\u00a0in my perspective, kind of a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d type of situation, where we\u2019re on the front lines of these climate change impacts. But as we see more and more of these, more parks are going to be faced with other challenges that may be just as, or even more, difficult to figure out."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": Here in the heart of Alaska, much of the ground is supposed to be semi-permanently frozen for most of the year. But Denny Capps says the signs of a changing climate here have been evident for years."},{"author":"Capps","text":": Denali is a really great place to understand what that future looks like. And also, with the temperatures that we\u2019ve had over the last few years, we\u2019re already hitting the predictions for 2040 for here and places in the park. So we\u2019re well ahead of\u00a0the existing forecast for climate change here in the park.\u00a0So that\u2019s really got our attention."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": At Pretty Rocks, the road conditions were changing so much by the end of this summer season\u00a0that park officials finally had to close it, cutting off access to a visitor\u2019s center that offers direct views of North America\u2019s tallest mountain and a wilderness lodge. And Pretty Rocks isn\u2019t the only spot that\u2019s keeping Denny Capps busy."},{"author":"Capps","text":": Yeah, certainly not. It\u2019s all up and down the park road we\u2019re having challenges with with permafrost. We do have a system that we refer to as the Unstable Slope Management Program, where we\u2019re tracking over 140 unstable slopes all up and down the park road. Now, not all those are necessarily being conditioned by permafrost, but many of them are."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": When you say 140, it seems like quite a high number of places for the park to have eyes on."},{"author":"Capps","text":": It is a relatively high number, but we want to make sure and not always be in a reactive position. And some of those sites are very minor maintenance concerns\u2014you know, things that we\u2019ve maybe had to do a little bit of dirt work on in the past. And we\u2019re just watching all the way up to Pretty Rocks. We\u2019ve got like major mass turnover that is causing road closures\u2014so\u00a0a whole range of severity and kind of magnitude and frequency of impacts across the board there."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": So what\u2019s causing all this movement? Warmer year-round temperatures combined with increased summer rainfall\u2014it all adds up to melting what was once frozen ground."},{"author":"Capps","text":": I know that I\u2019ve seen more intense rainfalls and flooding. We\u2019ve had a number of rainfall records that have been set in those 10 years that I\u2019ve been here, including some very intense rainfalls. We had what long-term Alaskan meteorologists described as the highest daily rainfall amount for a noncoastal site and in recorded history here last year. Here on the north side of the mountains, where it\u2019s relatively dry, and we have a lot of topographic relief, we have thawing permafrost. Having rain at that level could be catastrophic for us."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": It\u2019s kind of like pouring hot water on an ice cube."},{"author":"Capps","text":": It really is. And that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve come to recognize is\u2014it\u2019s really important\u2014is this rain and, specifically, the temperature of that rain, because I think we all know that, you know, if you have warm air, that can certainly warm things up. But if you have warm water, it actually carries more heat with it, and it brings that heat down into the ground. So we\u2019re really coming to recognize the importance of the amount and the temperature of rainfall coming down on these sensitive areas."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": Because much of Denali National Park is designated wilderness, long-term solutions are limited."},{"author":"Capps","text":": Unfortunately, we don\u2019t want to experiment too much here. You know, this is a sensitive place. So, for example, in other locations, instead of filling it in with gravel to build up the road, you might put in Styrofoam underneath because that insulates the ground, and it\u2019s much lighter. However, we don\u2019t want Styrofoam coming out into our environment here and raining plastic down our rivers forever. So, you know, we are in the process of determining exactly what it is that we\u2019re going to do at these locations. But in general, we\u00a0at Pretty Rocks are probably going to end up bridging the landslide there. It\u2019s one of the classic ways that you deal with any type of geologic hazard like this. If you have a bull charging at you, you step aside and let it go by. You don\u2019t square your shoulders and try to stop it. And so that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re going to do\u2014to try to do\u2014at Pretty Rocks.\u00a0"},{"author":"Schwing","text":": Denali is America\u2019s third largest National Park. The two that surpass it in size\u00a0are also located in Alaska: Gates of the Arctic and Wrangell\u2013St. Elias. And there, too, large swaths of permafrost are at risk of melting. From Paul Ollig\u2019s perspective, with a focus on educating and informing the public, he says there might be a silver lining."},{"author":"Ollig","text":":\u00a0Having specific infrastructure, like a potential bridge over a landslide\u00a0like Pretty Rocks, is a great tool for us to use.\u00a0As challenging as it is,\u00a0it does give us a very tangible item in which to frame the conversation about climate change impacts and to talk about solutions, to talk about what is going to be required of parks in order to adapt to changing conditions."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": Park officials are working on plans for a $55-million bridge over the slumping section of road at Pretty Rocks. Construction could begin as early as next summer.\u00a0Now that fall has set in, and the park has received its first snowfall, there\u2019s not much left to be done\u00a0other than watch and wait."},{"author":"Capps","text":": We\u2019re really curious to see how it\u2019s going to respond through the wintertime. So last spring, when we got out with spring road opening in late March, we had about an 18-vertical-foot scarp that dropped down. So we already have an 18-foot vertical scarp at that location. So we\u2019re certainly expecting major challenges next spring."},{"author":"Schwing","text":": As is normally the case in Alaska, it\u2019s never quite clear what melting snow might reveal when warmer weather returns the next year.
