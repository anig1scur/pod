The tool is called life2vec, and was described in a study published late last year.Bose: And it\u2019s really an AI widget that says when you\u2019re gonna\u00a0die? Leffer: \u00a0Sort of. Yes and no. Life2vec isn\u2019t just a death predictor. It\u2019s way more general than just mortality forecasts. It can offer more than that.\u00a0 One BIG CAVEAT right up top: it\u2019s hard to know exactly how accurate any of its predictions are at the moment\u2013 no one is claiming the tool can definitively predict an individual person\u2019s death. It\u2019s also trained on a very specific data set, namely one that contains information on residents of Denmark?\u00a0\u00a0So it can\u2019t offer meaningful predictions about anyone who isn\u2019t Danish.\u00a0"

The researchers built this model and trained it on tons of government-collected information on millions of people living in Denmark. They had employment history, basic demographic data, and also information on just about every interaction between people and the Danish medical system, because Denmark has universal healthcare."

It\u2019s a type of mode usually used for chatbots\u00a0 and language processing. It basically runs\u00a0 like souped-up autocomplete."

Data and statistics are wonky, particularly around death which is a rare event, if you think about it.\u00a0It only happens once in a person\u2019s life and young people don\u2019t tend to die very often. In fact, if you were to just assume that everyone between like 25-50 in a population was going to live in a given year, you\u2019d already be a really accurate death oracle.
