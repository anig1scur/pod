    "If you\u2019re a silphid beetle, a dead body is all your children really want, and it\u2019s your job\u2014no matter how difficult\u2014to get one for them."

      "text": ": Parenting can seem a thankless gig. First, you and your partner track down a dead body. Next, the two of you work together to bury it, and it\u2019s often many times the size of your own body. If it starts to rot, or you start to snack on this body, you\u2019ll have to cover the stench of decomposition with your own anal secretions so that other hungry, desperate, overworked parents don\u2019t come looking for your lunch. And this all before your kids are even born\u2014that is, if you\u2019re a silphid beetle. For\u00a0Scientific American\u2019s Science, Quickly,\u00a0I\u2019m Emily Schwing. [CLIP: Show music]"

And they try to find it when it\u2019s really fresh\u2014sometimes within hours of death, before there\u2019s any noticeable smell to humans."

      "text": ": This is a world collection. So I\u2019ve traveled all around the world and collected these in various parts of Asia. They\u2019re primarily found in the Northern Hemisphere. And when they do occur in the Southern Hemisphere, it\u2019s usually on mountaintops, which gives us a concern for them for climate change, because they\u2019re very cold-adapted. Mountaintops in the tropics are becoming warmer and warmer.\u00a0They\u2019re going to have to move up slope, and they may eventually lose habitat entirely."

      "text": ": This big one is about the size of my thumb, all black with plates of armor\u2014its exoskeleton\u2014laid out across its back. Other burying beetles have orange jagged stripes on their backs. Some are about the size of a sunflower seed\u00a0or even smaller. Silphid beetles belong to the subfamily Nicrophorinae, and parenting beetles don\u2019t just simply bury small\u00a0dead creatures and leave. Lurking in the shadows of the forest floor, where these bugs roam, there\u2019s a lot of competition: other hungry beetles and lots of vertebrate scavengers, all looking to feast on the same things silphids love to eat."

      "author": "Sikes",
      "text": ": But if more than one male or female find it, they\u2019ll fight. And so there\u2019ll be these beetle battles, right? And it\u2019s the largest beetles, invariably, that win these fights and drive off their competitors until you have the largest male and the largest female, who work together to dig underneath the carcass and get it down into a crypt. And they try to do this as fast as possible because the clock is ticking. There\u2019s blowflies. There\u2019s vertebrate scavengers. There's all kinds of things that want to eat a small, dead carcass. So they try to monopolize it and try to get it entirely for themselves."

      "author": "Schwing",
      "text": ": The silphid so fiercely protects its food source\u00a0because the eggs it lays will also feed on whatever\u2019s buried in this seeming crypt. Sikes says the reproductive output of this particular kind of beetle is low, compared to other insects, which is all the more reason they try to keep their food hidden."

      "text": ": That smell? To be honest, it\u2019s coming from microbe farts\u2014what the researchers call \u201cvolatiles\u201d\u2014that result from the decomposition process.\u00a0But Silphids don\u2019t want any other competition to know their food is rotting."

    {
      "author": "Sikes",
      "text": ": We\u2019ve discovered that the excretions and secretions of these beetles help conceal the scent from their competitors. And close relatives that aren\u2019t in this group, when they manipulate a carcass, when we put those out in the field, they are more easily found by burying beetles than control carcasses that haven\u2019t been manipulated."

      "author": "Schwing",
      "text": ": There are only about 70 species of burying beetles in the world. Sikes says that\u2019s a low number within the insect kingdom, and he believes that might be directly related to the parental care they offer their young."

    {
      "author": "Sikes",
      "text": ": So in most insects, there\u2019s very little parental care.\u00a0In a female, like a mosquito, it\u2019s usually limited to just choice of where they\u2019re going to put the eggs. You\u2019re going to put the eggs in a place that should give them a good chance of survival, their preferred habitat, you know. But with these beetles and some other insects that show parental care, they\u2019re\u2014the adults are spending a lot of time with their offspring as they're developing and doing interesting things like sharing their microbiome."
