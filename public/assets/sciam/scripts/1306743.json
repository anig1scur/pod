[News clip]\u00a0 And nearly two thirds of households were eating just one meal a day."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Of course, hunger isn\u2019t limited to Gaza. Millions of people are affected by hunger, especially in Somalia, Afghanistan and Sudan."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"While famine causes severe effects immediately, it can also affect people\u2019s health years down the road\u2014and possibly even the health of their children and grandchildren. Science journalist Amanda Ruggeri wrote about this in an online news story for Scientific American, and today we\u2019re going to break down what that means. I\u2019m Tanya Lewis, senior editor for health and medicine at Scientific American."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And I\u2019m Tulika Bose, senior multimedia editor."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And you\u2019re listening to Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly podcast. [INTRO MUSIC]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Gaza has a population of more than two million people. And right now, many of them are facing hunger, and some are dying\u2014including children."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Yeah\u2014there\u2019s a viral photo and story going around about Yazan Al-Kafarna\u2014a 10-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who died of acute malnutrition. The photos\u2014some taken by his father\u2014are shocking."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, those images are\u2014really hard to look at."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Some children with cerebral palsy have dysphagia\u2014a condition where it\u2019s difficult to swallow food. The food he normally ate\u2014blended fruit and milk\u2014were no longer available, which exacerbated his condition. Ultimately, he passed away."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That just shows how hard this situation is for children\u00a0 with special needs. But I want to be clear that it\u2019s not just sick children who are facing malnutrition. Reuters and other outlets have reported that hospitals in Gaza are grappling with an influx of malnourished children, including toddlers. One report found that one in six babies and toddlers in northern Gaza are acutely malnourished."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Of course, chronic hunger is a problem not just in Gaza, but for millions of people in multiple countries worldwide.\u00a0 So, one of our contributors\u2014Amanda Ruggeri\u2014has done some really powerful reporting on how starvation affects people\u2019s health, even years later\u2014and possibly, even their descendants."},{"author":"Bose","text":"I\u2019ve heard of this."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"In the short-term, starvation and malnutrition can obviously be life-threatening."},{"author":"Bose","text":"What\u2019s the difference between starvation and malnutrition? I\u2019ve seen this used interchangeably online."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Starvation is literally not getting enough food. Malnutrition is not getting an adequate amount of specific nutrients. So malnutrition can include starvation, but it can also include having an imbalance of different food groups. Malnourished children can also experience a number of different health problems, such as wasting and stunted growth."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Are these effects permanent? What\u2019s the difference between stunting and wasting?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Wasting is basically an acute form malnutrition when your muscle and fat waste away. Stunting is a more permanent, chronic form of malnutrition. Bose: So it\u2019s not reversible?\u00a0 LewisIt depends on the severity of the case, but generally stunting is not reversible.\u00a0 Malnutrition can also have life-threatening complications such as severe anemia, diarrhea or sepsis."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Wow, that\u2019s sobering. What about down the road\u2014can it cause problems later in life?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah, even after children return to normal nutrition, they continue to show health issues months or years later\u2014such as heart disease, high blood pressure and metabolic disease."},{"author":"Bose","text":"And even people who are exposed to famine before birth can be affected, right? There\u2019s something that I was reading about called the Dutch Hunger Winter."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right, so\u00a0 the Dutch Hunger Winter was a famine in the Netherlands from 1944 to 1945, during German occupation in World War II. There was a major study in 1976 of 300,000 men who were born during that time. The study found that individuals who were exposed to hunger while in utero during the first half of pregnancy were more likely to be obese as adults than those who weren\u2019t exposed to hunger or those who were exposed later in pregnancy. [Sound here]"},{"author":"Bose","text":"Huh, so being exposed to hunger as a developing fetus actually made people more likely to be overweight later in life?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Yeah. Other studies have found that men who were in the womb during that famine were also more likely to develop heart disease and not live as long as those born soon afterward."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So, what do scientists think could be responsible for these long-lasting effects?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Epigenetics. It\u2019s basically the set of processes that turn parts of the genome on or off. The way this normally happens is through something called DNA methylation. Studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter show that people who were exposed to famine during gestation had differences in DNA methylation 60 years later, compared with siblings who were born later on. And some research suggests being exposed to famine might affect people\u2019s children, too."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Studies of the Great Chinese Famine, which occurred from 1959 to 1961 under Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist regime and killed tens of millions of people, found that children of people exposed to the famine were more likely to have high blood sugar, obesity and cognitive difficulties."},{"author":"Bose","text":"Yeah, so funny story\u2014I have to get tested for diabetes because I\u2019m Bengali\u2014and some academics have argued that the famines due to policies imposed by the British Raj led to something called the \u201cstarvation gene.\u201d Basically, the idea that your body is more likely to hold onto fat. In fact, South Asians\u2014particularly Bengalis\u2014have a higher risk of diabetes, cardiac disease and other metabolic conditions."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Oh wow, that\u2019s really fascinating\u2014and really awful. Some research has actually hinted that the effects of being exposed to hunger could actually affect the third generation\u2014a so-called \u201cgrandchild effect.\u201d But this is where it gets a little hairy. Because epigenetic marks get wiped out every generation, it\u2019s not totally clear how the changes would be passed down."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So does that mean we don\u2019t know how exactly famine affects future generations?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right\u2014it\u2019s possible that any epigenetic changes in subsequent generations are simply due to the fact that if a female baby was exposed to famine in the womb her ovaries and eggs would also be exposed, so her own babies might eventually have similar impacts."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So it would be passed through the maternal line."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s correct, according to these researchers\u2014but other researchers disagree. So there\u2019s still some contention about whether epigenetic markers are being fully wiped out\u2014not to get all in the weeds."},{"author":"Bose","text":"So\u2014as of right now, researchers are saying it\u2019s going to be difficult to track the full intergenerational effects of famine\u2014especially in Gaza."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Absolutely. As Aryeh Stein, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University, put it: Aryeh Stein: \u201cWith famine, you get social breakdowns. So it gets incredibly difficult to maintain the records to identify who was exposed.\u201d [OUTRO MUSIC]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Timmy Broderick.
