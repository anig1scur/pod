The essays of World of Wonders are, for the most part, titled with the name of a species, whether that\u2019s a species of fruit or animal or plant. The essay becomes an exploration of that species\u2019 life entwined with stories from Nezhukumatathil\u2019s own life. An essay on the axolotl, for example, includes descriptions of the salamander\u2019s charming smile and regenerative capabilities running parallel to tales of microaggressions a brown woman might experience through childhood and adulthood."},{"author":"Prologue","text":"And another essay on the corpse flower becomes an ode to both the flower\u2019s many curiosities, and its unusual role in helping Nezhukumatathil decide between possible suitors. The second collection is Vesper Flights, by Helen Macdonald. Macdonald draws on personal stories, scientific history, and literature to examine nature as it\u2019s observed and experienced in many different forms. In the title essay, \u201cVesper Flights,\u201d we learn of the strange flying habits of the swift and what their ascension as a community means to Macdonald as she reflects on how she navigates challenges."},{"author":"Prologue","text":"And another essay called \u201cSwan Upping\u201d describes the old English tradition of catching all the swans on the River Thames to track their lineage and ownership, and then dives further into that particular custom to explore nationalism in the UK, in the era of Brexit."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"Before we give World of Wonders and Vesper Flights the full science book talk treatment, I want take a step back and acknowledge that these two books are a little bit different from the previous books we\u2019ve talked about in this series. Our previous books and episodes have been much more focused on one particular topic, whether that topic was fish, moss, or abandoned spaces."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"They have a specificity to them that I\u2019m generally really excited by because it lets you go deep into a topic.\u00a0 And written as they are by authors who take their subjects on with enthusiasm and curiosity, those books and their specificity are able to build to some bigger picture that goes beyond the narrow scope of the author\u2019s original intentions. That\u2019s what allows a book about eels to also be about family, or a book about mushrooms to also be about our minds.\u00a0 In contrast, World of Wonders and Vesper Flights are broad by design."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"They are assembled from essays that each explore different aspects of nature and personal experience. And so as you work your way through these books, you travel from topic to topic, from land to air to plant to animal."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"And these two different types of writing feel in some ways like two very different ways that many of us experience science and nature.\u00a0 I\u2019ve worked in a lab and have been writing about science, so a lot of my experience with science has been that feeling of getting immersed in a very narrow area of knowledge and wanting to tell everyone how cool this one thing is. And that all feels a bit the way those topic-focused books feel."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"But I\u2019m also definitely a bit of an indoor kid, so when it comes to everything outside my window, it all feels like a lot. Like you can go on a walk, and all around you are so many different bits of chemistry and biology and geology coming together, and it\u2019s both wonderful and hard to pin down. And that\u2019s what these essay collections feel like. They\u2019re a trek through different narrator\u2019s worlds."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"The specificity in them is the author and the different sights that have made up their lives, and how they\u2019ve processed what they\u2019ve lived.\u00a0 For Nezhukumatathil, this is a world shaped by her experiences growing up in America, but also influenced by forms of nature from her parents\u2019 homelands. For Macdonald, this is a world characterized by British landscapes, but with sights from other travels as well.\u00a0 And with such different settings within them, these are essay collections that go in their own directions."},{"author":"Chapter 1: Scope and Scale","text":"So you might not necessarily expect these two books to have a sense of commonality weaving through them. But despite their scope and scale, there is a core to them that feels universal, a core that starts in childhood."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"One of the main sources of inspiration that connects these two books is childhood. After all, what is more poignant to us than the nature we grew up with, the trees and creeks and lawns we played in and wove in to our earliest stories of the world?"},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"Nezhukumatathil\u2019s first essay in World of Wonders is called \u201cCatalpa Tree.\u201d The first sentence is as follows: \u201cA catalpa can give two brown girls in western Kansas a green umbrella from the sun.\u201d Our first image of the catalpa is as a shelter, not just for Nezhukumatathil, but later we learn for the sphinx moth as well as it lays eggs in the catalpa\u2019s leaves.\u00a0 Over the course of the essay, we come to understand the ways that Nezhukumatathil\u2019s relationship with that shelter has changed as she\u2019s grown up."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"In childhood, where her brownness was distinct and a source of self-consciousness, the shelter is necessary. But when the tree reappears in adulthood, she\u2019s surprised to find it less necessary. The tree becomes\u2014as so many sources of nostalgia do\u2014a marker of change both internal and external. Macdonald documents her own similar encounters with nostalgia in the essay \u201cTekels Park,\u201d which starts: \u201c \u201cI shouldn\u2019t do the thing I do, because motorway driving requires you to keep your eyes on the road."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"I shouldn\u2019t do it also because pulling at your heart on purpose is a compulsion as particular and disconcerting as pressing on a healing bruise.\u201d\u00a0 But as she explains, Macdonald always looks, because she knows what the land looked like decades before from when she grew up in the area. She describes the way the meadow parkland turned her into a young naturalist, with its many insects and birds to identify and catalogue.\u00a0 But we know from those first few sentences that the scenery has changed."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"Some of those changes are routine, like the yearly mowing to trim the meadow down. Over the decades, however, the changes become more drastic, altering the area to something more like a soccer field than a home for wildlife.\u00a0 Macdonald writes, \u201cWhen you are small, the things you see around you promise you they\u2019ll continue as they are forever\u2026\u201d And what feels more eternal than the trees and animals around you?"},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"The reality, of course, is that they are not immortal, and the loss of this nature can hit particularly hard, as it does for Macdonald.\u00a0 And yet, not all losses are tragic."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"That line Macdonald wrote, about how the things you see around you as a kid promise they\u2019ll continue as they are forever, it hit a sore spot in the context of her essay, reminding me of every conversation I\u2019ve had with a friend or a family member of a place we\u2019ve grown up in that looks different now.\u00a0 But it hit me differently when I thought of it in the context of Nezhukumatathil\u2019s catalpa essay, where the nature stays constant, but the world around it has still shifted."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"She writes, \u201cThe foot-long leaves of catalpa trees like this one, for me, always meant shade from persistent sun and shelter from unblinking eyes. When I moved to the South, I thought I\u2019d need to make use of those wide leaves constantly, but for the first time in my life, I haven\u2019t had to.\u201d\u00a0 In the same way that the things we love as children seem eternal, so to do our hurts seem enduring."},{"author":"Chapter 2: What we lose","text":"The looks or comments we might get from strangers, the things that drive us to seek shelter to begin with\u2014those are things that come with a sharp pain that might seem like it\u2019ll never go away. And yet those hurts can fade too, or the nature of them can shift so that even if the pain is still there as a reminder of the past, there is still something present and different that may also be worthwhile, something that resembles hope."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":""},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":""},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":""},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":""},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"In an essay titled \u201cAshes,\u201d Macdonald asks the following: \u201cChildren who are growing up watching glaciers retreat and sea ice vanishing, villages sinking, tundra wildfires raging and once-common trees disappearing\u2014will they learn to regard constant disappearances as the ordinary way of the world?\u201d\u00a0 This quote stuck with me through both World of Wonders and Vesper Flights\u2014two books that are as much about nature as they are about how we use nature to understand ourselves\u2014because it kept me wondering what it will look like for future generations to turn to nature for their proxies.\u00a0 Of course, nature is going to exist, but differently, so that the metaphors that are already historical to us will seem like hidden relics or riddles in only a few decades.\u00a0 And not all of this lost knowledge is a function of lost habitats."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of what knowledge is passed on. Nezhukumatathil includes a pair of essays centered around fireflies. In the first firefly essay, she describes their synchronous glow and says, \u201cThey blink on and off, a lime glow to the summer night air, as if to say: I am still here, you are still here, I am still here, you are still here, I am, you are, over and over again.\u201d\u00a0 It feels, again, like the promise of our childhood haunts to stick around."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"But in \u201cFirefly (redux),\u201d the essay which also closes the collection, Nezhukumatathil finds that most of her students have never seen or heard of a firefly, even though the town is full of them. She asks, \u201cWhat is lost when you grow up not knowing the names for different varieties of fireflies?\u201d\u00a0 And it\u2019s not simply a matter of lost knowledge. Sometimes what we pass on is our own failures."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"Nezhukumatathil has another essay in the collection titled \u201cQuestions while searching for birds with my half-white sons, aged six and nine, National Audubon Bird Count Day, Oxford, MS.\u201d The essay is loose, structured only in the form of those questions. Some are the normal questions borne of curiosity or necessity, like \u201cIs there a bathroom nearby?\u201d And \u201cWhy do lady cardinals look so sad and boy cardinals look like they are going to a party?\u201d But then others build to something bleaker. At one point we hear, \u201cAt school we have to hide under desks in case of bad people."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"We did that last week. It\u2019s called \u201cLockdown!\u201d We have to be quiet like what we\u2019re doing now while we wait for birds.\u201d\u00a0 The metaphor might be based on the familiarity of birds, but it\u2019s also based on aspects of childhood that are newer, unfamiliar to many of us even if they\u2019re built on a world we\u2019ve passed on to them through tragedy and failure."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"In \u201cAshes,\u201d Macdonald writes, \u201cIncreasingly, knowing your surroundings, recognizing the species of animals and plants around you, means opening yourself to constant grief.\u201d\u00a0 Nezhukumatathil suggests one approach to this problem in \u201cFireflies (redux)\u201d: \u201cMaybe what we can do when we feel overwhelmed is to start small. Start with what we have loved as kids and see where that leads us.\u201d Of course, as we\u2019ve seen with both World of Wonders and Vesper Flights, starting with what we have loved as kids does not mean you can avoid grief or a sense of loss."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"But loss has always been a part of this world, a universal experience that long predates climate change. It makes itself known in every aspect of our experience, from birth until death.\u00a0 And with every loss comes the knowledge that the world still goes, a fact that can feel like a cheap comfort and reverent promise all wrapped into one. There\u2019s a future on the other side, one that holds whatever hope we put into it."},{"author":"Chapter 3: What we pass on","text":"As Macdonald writes to close \u201cTekels Park\u201d and its exploration of her childhood scenery: \u201cI know that what I am looking for, beyond the fence, is a place that draws me because it exists neither wholly in the past, nor in the present, but is caught in a space in between, and that space is a place which gestures towards the future and whose little hurts are hope.\u201d"},{"author":"Epilogue","text":"I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t feel like ending this summer reading series on a note about loss, even if it\u2019s tinged with hope. World of Wonders and Vesper Flights were first and foremost books about, well, wonder. They were about seeing bits of nature both big and small all around you, and then delighting in them."},{"author":"Epilogue","text":"The language was beautiful, and in the case of World of Wonders, the illustrations were also beautiful.\u00a0 Over the course of this series and the eight books we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve seen authors with different backgrounds and subjects all come up against what feels like an inevitable question, of a need to understand how we place ourselves relative to nature. Some have explored this in questions of anthropomorphism, others in discussions about the anthropocene.\u00a0 Macdonald writes of this too in Vesper Flights.
