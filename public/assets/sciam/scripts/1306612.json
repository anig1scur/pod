We\u2019re talking about sex\u2014specifically, sex in space. It\u2019s a topic NASA and other space agencies have treated as taboo for decades\u2014because let\u2019s be real \u2014 nobody wants to explain to Congress why taxpayer dollars would be spent on something so titillating. This prudish, head-in-the-sand approach worked well enough for managing the straitlaced, Boy Scout\u2013like and overwhelmingly male astronaut crews of half a century ago."},{"author":"Lee Billings","text":"But today, with human spaceflight booming as never before and more and more everyday people signing up to someday slip Earth\u2019s surly bonds, figuring out how folks will stay healthy and happy in orbital habitats is actually kind of important\u2014and sex is a fundamental part of that complex equation. I\u2019m Lee Billings, senior editor for space and physics at Scientific American, and this is Science, Quickly.\u00a0 [CLIP: Intro music]"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Our guests today are two experts on \u201cspace sexology\u201d (yes, that is a real thing): Simon Dub\u00e9, a research psychologist at the Kinsey Institute, and Shawna Pandya, director of the Space Medicine Group at the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences. And they\u2019re here to tell you everything you\u2019ve always wanted to know about sex in space but were perhaps too afraid to ask."},{"author":"Simon Dub\u00e9","text":"Thank you for having us."},{"author":"Billings","text":"We are here to talk today about sex\u2014in space. Is sex seen as somehow verboten, or somehow forbidden, not to ever be discussed within NASA and other space agencies? And it\u2019s not like that with commercial space or what?"},{"author":"Pandya","text":"I think there must have been this rumor floating around NASA for the longest time that if they discussed sex in space, they would go blind or something like that\u2014because, historically speaking, NASA very much took a Disney approach. I think that part of it was being cognizant of, we have to tread very, very carefully. Otherwise our funding might be pulled. There's stories of proposed research that was quashed, careers that were ruined, because it wasn't deemed a priority, and it was deemed to be actually quite salacious."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"We're talking about programs that were built for science and from the military\u2014two very conservative areas of research\u2014and, as Dr. Pandya says, funded by the taxpayers. Now, there was research between the 1960s and 1990s looking at reproduction in nonhuman animals, but a lot of [this] research might not have been deemed, like, a priority, especially on the side of humans, obviously for ethical reason and political reasons as well."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"Eventually, if we wanna settle another world or establish ourselves and travel long distances and become spacefaring civilization, we need to deal with reproduction, obviously, but we also need to deal with sex, with falling in love, with the challenges and complexity of human eroticism beyond Earth."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"And because we do it so well on Earth as well, clearly it\u2019s going to go so well in space."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9","text":"Right now our main focus has been coming from biology. And when I say biology, I mean at large, like microbiology, molecular biology, whatnot\u2014studying the effects of gravity and radiation, or lack of gravity and extreme radiation, on reproductive function, reproductive cells and tissues and organs. And we\u2019re really figuring out that, okay, we have a massive problem on our end on that front. And once we figure out the shield from radiation, help people maintain better health and also maybe some form of artificial gravity...."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"I'm going to let you in on a little secret that not many people know. So you may want to lean in for this, but there have been lovers in space. They\u2019ve been caught on tape."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Wait, what?"},{"author":"Pandya","text":"So we have caught the Japanese medaka fish on space shuttle Columbia, 1994. They mated it in space, and we have it on tape!"},{"author":"Billings","text":"You had me going there for a second. I thought you were going to talk about the infamous space shuttle astronauts who got secretly married before their joint mission and then NASA got all hush hush about what happened and, you know, red in the face."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"Mark Lee and Jan Davis, yes; shuttle era. I think I would be hearing from lawyers if I put forth that rumor that it was humans. No, to be clear, it was Japanese medaka fish. However, there is video footage of that."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"The bottom line when we look at all of the history of studies from zebra fish to salamanders to quail eggs to mice to rats to wasps, uh, the one-line summary is that the data is conflicting at best, and further studies are needed\u2014because in some cases, gravitational exposure causes, interferes with neurodevelopment, and we observe challenges with development even in mammals, in mice and rats. However, in other cases, that is transient. In certain cases, there is a higher rate of offspring death, so we saw that in one of the Biosatellite experiments when wasps were flown to space."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"How robust is this data? And then how does that apply to higher-order mammals? So that's the big question mark. And, um, to quote Dr. [Jim] Logan, who really was a proponent and, you know, um, an early explorer in this field, like, we need to know the gravity prescription, what amount of gravity for what duration and at what exposure in development is enough, to successfully be able to, um, develop, to gestate, to give birth and to have a normal, viable development as a human being."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"We don't know that, and we need to find that out\u2014if we are serious about becoming this permanent, off-world, multiplanetary species."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"Yes, we have to deal with the fact that developmental anomalies and all kinds of problems could affect higher-order mammals and, like, us as we move into space. But we also need to think, okay, gynecology, reproductive health, population diversity, having children, raising children, evolution, sexual rights, sexual rights, including pleasure and intersectionality, social justice issue, our sexual responses and behavior. We have limited to zero data about sexual behavior and responses. People focus on the question \u201cOh, can, can people have sex in space?\u201d Probably."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"\u201cCan they have sex in space safely and ethically and keep their environment viable?\u201d That's the actual question when we think about the practical component. And when we think about the complexity of human eroticism, it\u2019s not whether people are going to be able to masturbate or have sex with a partner in space. It\u2019s what happens the next morning. What happened the next morning to the individual, to the couples, to the crew, to the mission?"},{"author":"Pandya","text":"How awkward is it for the rest of the crew who was kept up all night?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"I want to go ahead and betray my biases. Like, I feel like we've managed here on Earth to perform sex acts just fine since time immemorial. I\u2019m very confident\u2014and, as I guess, you are, too\u2014that, that we will rise to the challenge of having sex in space, the physical act, even though there are all kinds of limitations and quirks. I think we're going to figure that out really well."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"Let\u2019s imagine a graphic of two people intimately entwined, one person straddling the other; the other one\u2019s velcroed down. So we need to think about Newton's third law of physics. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, including thrust, right? You need to figure out the mechanics of how you're going to stay entwined in order to, to be able to actually, successfully, copulate. There\u2019s people who thought about that. [The late] Vanna Bonta, an actress and an inventor, she has famously proposed the 2suit, and it\u2019s like a snuggie for two people, but they get to bind together."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"She\u2019s tested in zero g. So that\u2019s one option. One of my favorite suggestions is from a German astronaut, Ulrich [Walter], who, during the 1980s..., he\u2019d kind of looked at this, this whole topic and said, Well, why don't we just borrow ideas from the animal kingdom? Dolphins, they\u2019re kind of in a neutral buoyancy environment. So when two dolphins are trying to mate, a third dolphin comes in, takes one for the team and holds a partner in place so that the two dolphins can successfully mate."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"So then his suggestion is: Why doesn\u2019t an astronaut take one for the team so they can all do it dolphin-style in the name of the greater good, so we can copulate in space. So there you go. A very brief history of what has been studied for intercourse in space."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Some of this stuff almost has a giggle factor associated with it, right? Imagining these things, even though physics dictates you need to have some sort of creative solution, whether that\u2019s going to be strapping yourself in with a new creative use of the CPR machine on the ISS or or whether it\u2019s going to be a two-person spacesuit, a big, sweaty snuggie. The so-called giggle factor here where people will just kind of close their minds up because it\u2019s so alien and seemingly absurd and therefore not to be taken seriously."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"I don\u2019t actually try to stop it at all. When it\u2019s a little giggle, usually it means there's actually, in my experience, openness to the discussion. Then I try to move rapidly to explaining, look, I know it's funny, but we have to think about it for the future of humanity and for the well-being of those who are going into space very rapidly. So usually that little giggle is some residue of our, sex is messy, sex is quirky, we\u2019re kind of immature about it. But at the same time, it\u2019s fun."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"Let\u2019s not shy away from that little giggle."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Where are we going to go from here? How are we going to enact changes and make progress? It seems like we run into some very tough ethical quandaries in some situations."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"There\u2019s so much to unpack here. Should we have a policy against fraternization for government-space-agency-funded missions? Can we mandate that? If two people sneak off and pair off, and then all of a sudden, one, the female astronaut ends up pregnant\u2014can we, should we, can we mandate a termination of mission? Can we mandate a termination of that pregnancy if they\u2019re on Mars due to the health risks involved? There are so many ethical threads to pull on here. Say, there is a Martian mission. There\u2019s six people. It\u2019s multiple. It\u2019s multilateral. It\u2019s funded by taxpayers."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"And then suddenly there\u2019s a pregnancy that has come up on the Martian crew, and it turns out that both of them were actually married with spouses at home. So this is salacious. It\u2019s a scandal. And is there a duty to inform the taxpayers? So there\u2019s also a logical reason to start thinking about this, about worst-case scenarios because we can\u2019t just cross our fingers and hope for the best when it comes to space. It\u2019s high-risk. It's high-reward, but it\u2019s high-risk."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"And then speaking to the more immediate term since 2021, we\u2019ve entered this golden age of commercial human spaceflight. We\u2019ve seen Blue Origin, Axiom Space, Virgin Galactic, SpaceX literally take off. We\u2019ve seen the rise of the civilian astronaut movement. And so we\u2019re democratizing access to space. And so more and more people are going to want to go to space for fun, for leisure and for pleasure. And like Simon says, we can\u2019t dictate what people do or do not do in space. Someone is going to want to be the first."},{"author":"Pandya","text":"So we need to think about how we approach sexuality, sexual health, reproduction space in a way that is very considered, mindful, inclusive and ethical."},{"author":"Billings","text":"The message is very consistent. This is a looming problem. It\u2019s not going away. It\u2019s in fact getting bigger and more proximate. But the question is: What and how? Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic? Do you think the action is going to come from a space agency, or is it going to come from someone kind of outside of that structure?"},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"Most of the research done on human factors in space is done here on Earth. We just need to deploy the arsenal of methods that we have in sex research and sexology and apply it to the study of sexuality and intimacy in space. So am I optimistic about this? I know and work with plenty of stellar scientists who are moving the ball forward. What I\u2019m more pessimistic about and what\u2014I cannot stress this enough if anyone's listening here\u2014is the timeline. Right now we need a tremendous amount of data in a short period of time."},{"author":"Dub\u00e9: ","text":"It takes time to get quality data and then transform that into policies, systems, mechanics, procedures to make it safe and ethical for everyone. Right now I'm not pessimistic about our ability to do that. I\u2019m pessimistic about the time in which we have to accomplish so much work."},{"author":"Billings","text":"For Science, Quickly, this is Lee Billings.
