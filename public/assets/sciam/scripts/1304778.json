The fairy shrimp then grow as fast as they can, they reproduce, they put out their own eggs, and then those eggs just sit there for a while. Enduring drought or fire until the next time it rains. It could be decades ..."

And then just like the fairy shrimp, when the rains come, the seeds germinate and transform into tiny, bright green seedlings that can grow slowly for months under water. Then, as the water in the pools evaporates, the plants go through a growth spurt\u2014and they shoot up to eight to 10 inches tall in just a few weeks and push out flowers."
