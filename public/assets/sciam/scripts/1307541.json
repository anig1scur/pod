But the conservation story behind the last truly wild horse is worth your time."],"authors":["Rachel Feltman","Allison Parshall","Fonda Mwangi"],"category":["Animals"],"transcript":[{"author":"Rachel Feltman","text":"Wild horses are pretty rare outside of classic rock songs. Some of the most famous ones, like those on Assateague Island, aren\u2019t actually wild at all. They\u2019re the feral descendants of domesticated horses. But the animal shown in a few recent viral TikToks may be another matter entirely: a horse of a different color, if you will\u2014or more accurately, a horse of a different species. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Associate news editor and friend of the pod Allison Parshall is here today to tell us more about these majestic beasts. Before we get into it, I have one very important question to start us off, which is: How do you say the name of this horse?"},{"author":"Allison Parshall","text":"I would love to tell you\u2014a lot of my sources when I asked gave me different answers, so, you know, we\u2019re going to take this with a grain of salt. It is spelled P-R-Z-E-W-A-L-S-K-I, but it is pronounced shuh-val-ski, or pshuh-val-ski\u2014a lot of people will put a P in the front, and I\u2019m not quite sure my tongue knows how to do that. But\u2014so we\u2019re going to go with shuh-val-ski for now. This is the name that Western science has given them after a Russian explorer quote, unquote \u201cdiscovered\u201d them in the Central Asian steppes, but they\u2019ve long been called other names in that part of the world, too. In Mongolia they\u2019ve long been called takhi, and in Kazakhstan they\u2019re called the kertagy or the kerkulan."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"All extremely reasonable names."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yes, I won\u2019t claim that I\u2019m pronouncing either of those names correctly either. These are a totally different species from the domesticated horse that you may or may not have ridden in your childhood and/or your adulthood. They even have a different number of chromosomes\u2014they\u2019re not an ancestor of the domesticated horse; they\u2019re just a different part of the horse family tree entirely. The horses that roam free around the world, like the wild mustangs, they are actually feral, so they\u2019re descendants of domesticated horses. But these are wild as far as we know\u2014and there\u2019s some controversy about this\u2014but as far as we know, the [Przewalski\u2019s horse] was never domesticated by humans. So it\u2019s kind of like the difference between a feral, stray cat that you find in an alley\u2014as the wild horses\u2014and, like, a wild cat. So these are fairly different."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s very cool. I had a, a cat once that was a stray that I\u2019m pretty sure had a little bit of a not-domesticated cat in him, and he was weird [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Behavior totally changes with domestication, and we can totally see this with the Przewalski\u2019s horses. I would like to do a little experiment, perhaps. I want you to just look up a picture of a Przewalski\u2019s horse and tell me what it looks like to you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"All right, so I\u2019m looking at a bunch of pictures of Przewalski horses. They definitely are very horselike. I don\u2019t think that if you showed me this in isolation, with no context, I would think there was something wrong with this horse, but they definitely have some distinct features: really thick-necked\u2014definitely look like the bodybuilders of the horse world; also kind of look like a bad sort of buzz cut\u2014really thick, nice head of hair but terrible haircut."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"The mane that sticks straight up looks more like a zebra than a horse."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm, yeah, it\u2019s like, once you\u2019re really looking at them\u2014again, in the context of knowing that it\u2019s a different species\u2014you\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, like, the\u2014parts of it kind of look more like a donkey, parts of it look more like a zebra.\u201d And it\u2019s interesting, you know, in some of these pictures, there are calves\u2014you know, baby Przewalski horses\u2014and they look actually much less standard horse to me. Like them, if I saw them in isolation, I would be like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d [Laughs] \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that baby horse?\u201d \u2019Cause they\u2019re just kind of more gangly."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"These animals have totally different behavior. Despite the fact that a lot of them have been raised in captivity, they\u2019re not comfortable around humans. Like, the zookeepers that take care of them\u2014I talked to a couple\u2014they have to sedate them in order to do anything like draw blood or trim their hooves. They don\u2019t shoe them. They\u2019re not trying to tame them in any way. These are still wild animals, even the ones that are living in captivity. They also have a particular social structure: So they\u2019re group animals, and they have a hierarchy. So there\u2019s one stallion that\u2019s, like, the head of the group, and then he\u2019s got a harem of mares. And so herds can have multiple of these groups, but that\u2019s kind of the general idea. And even within those groups, there\u2019ll be a hierarchy of stallion and harems within them. So, yeah, they\u2019re very particular, they are wild animals, and I now love them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Why is the Internet suddenly obsessed with them?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I asked myself that when I got the videos served to me by the TikTok algorithm. I have made no indication that I like horses\u2014I\u2019m not exactly sure why it\u2019s given me this, but I\u2019m glad it did because basically, on TikTok, we had two separate accounts that started posting videos in June, claiming that they may have acquired a Przewalski\u2019s horse, which would be very strange because this species is endangered and it\u2019s kept tabs on very closely by scientists. So here\u2019s kind of the timeline: On June 9 a rescue and sanctuary for horses in Utah called Lazy B Equine Rescue and Sanctuary posted a video of a very stocky horse with a mane that sticks straight up running around in a pen, and the text over the video said, \u201cDid we just have a Przewalski mare surrendered?!\u201d They said that they ordered a DNA test and later clarified that that would take up to six weeks, plus postage time. So then two days later a teenager in Colorado, having seen that video from the equine sanctuary, posted a video of a horse that\u2014again, to my untrained eye\u2014looks Przewalski-ish, with the text, \u201cpov, you accidentally rescued a purebred Przewalski stud.\u201dThey called him Shrek, and the other place called theirs Fiona, so that\u2019s kind of cute.\u00a0"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Going from Przewalski-ish horse\u2014which is a great phrase; thank you for that\u2014to, like, \u201cThis is a purebred stud,\u201d that\u2019s a big jump."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"They said that they were \u201cable to pull hair samples\u201d and that, quote, \u201chis DNA came back as a purebred Przewalski.\u201d They also said they contacted, quote, \u201cthe zoo, as well as the brand board\u201d and that they, quote, \u201chave been told [that] we can keep him.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, it is illegal to own endangered animals without special permits, like the ones that zoos or rescue facilities might have. But these are definitely extraordinary claims, and I certainly cannot speak to the veracity of them, since there\u2019s been no specific evidence provided. Lazy B Equine Rescue and Sanctuary has not claimed that it\u2019s 100 percent sure it\u2019s a Przewalski."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I can respect asking that question with an interrobang and then seeking confirmation [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I think \u201cconfirmation\u201d is the word of the day. The tone of the videos was like, \u201cAs soon as I saw this horse, I knew it was something rare and extraordinary: a Przewalski\u2019s horse,\u201d so I wanted to know what that meant. And it turns out there\u2019s a ton going on right now with these horses. You know, TikTok rumors aside, they\u2019re actually an incredible conservation story, and there\u2019s important things happening right now with them."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, I\u2019m so glad that TikTok has given us an excuse to talk about them. So what happened to these horses, to backtrack a little bit?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"They died off in the wild starting around the 1800s, we think. It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly when or why or even where, in parts of the world, they went extinct, but it\u2019s most likely a combination of hunting and poaching from humans and environmental changes that may or may not be attributable to humans. So some were captured and transported to Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s and kept in captivity there. That was kind of before anyone really realized that their numbers were in perilous decline. There was a very sharp decline after World War II, and by the 1960s it became clear that the horses in captivity were the only ones left. So they\u2019re extinct in the wild, and in captivity there were, like, 30 to 40 around the mid-20th century, and only around a dozen of them\u2014maybe a few more\u2014were capable of reproducing. All of the Przewalski\u2019s that we have today are descended from around a dozen."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, that\u2019s quite a bottleneck, so how did we manage to bring them back?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It was definitely a very dire situation. At the time there weren\u2019t really any examples of animals that had gone extinct in the wild but were successfully saved by captive breeding. Those efforts had really just started up, like, for example, with the Arabian oryx\u2014which is a very cool-looking antelope that I would recommend looking it up\u2014that went extinct [in the wild] by 1972.\u00a0 I spoke with Oliver Ryder. He\u2019s of the San Diego Wildlife [Alliance], and he\u2019s been working on this since the 1970s\u2014the San Diego Zoo has been really an important part of it. And one of the things they\u2019ve been trying to do\u2014like you mentioned, a bottleneck of only 12-ish individuals\u2014they really need to make sure they preserve genetic diversity. Now they\u2019ve reached the point where, you know, they\u2019re out of that horrible bottleneck, but they need to make sure that genetic diversity is not lost. So they\u2019ve actually cloned a horse twice, the same horse, from around 1980 the samples were taken. There\u2019s now two foals. One was born in 2020 and then one in 2023. Their names are Kurt and Ollie, both after scientists that were part of the breeding program. And the ultimate goal, though, is not just, like, clone them forever; it\u2019s to reintroduce them to their native habitat. And some of that\u2019s already been done, actually. They\u2019ve been reintroducing them since, like, the 1980s and 1990s into Mongolia, China and Russia, and they\u2019ve actually been doing pretty well: about half of the animals alive today\u2014so a bit over 1,000\u2014live in the wild. And there\u2019s also other ones in reserves\u2014I thought this was so interesting\u2014but the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which will not be deemed habitable for humans for, like, thousands of years, there\u2019s actually a good number of the horses just roaming around there. They reintroduced them in the late 1990s there, and there was this charming study from 2019 that showed that they\u2019re actually hanging out, sleeping in and mating in human-made structures like barns."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I\u2019ve talked about the Chernobyl situation on my other podcast, The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week, before, and it is wild how many studies now are like, \u201cYeah, the radiation was no good, but, like, it turns out that it was less bad than having humans was,\u201d which is, you know, humbling, I would say, humbling. But I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re having fun [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"There\u2019s even newer developments. So that was all back in the 1990s and then some of these reintroduction efforts in, like, the 2000s and 2010s. But then most recently they\u2019re back in Kazakhstan. So there was a failed reintroduction effort in Kazakhstan to a national park in 2003. Like, they tried their hardest, but the herds didn\u2019t make it. These horses have been absent from the ecosystem in Kazakhstan for a very long time, but they were finally flown, about seven of them, from the Prague Zoo and a zoo in Berlin in June. The horses are lovely. One of them was named Zorro, which I think is cute. And another one is named Tessa."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That is very cute. So obviously this has been a huge success, but what were the hurdles they faced\u2014other than the genetic bottleneck we talked about?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"The hurdles for reintroduction are vast. A lot of the people I talked to were like, \u201cRed tape, paperwork was one of the biggest things.\u201d For example, they were absent for so long from Kazakhstan that they weren\u2019t even classified as a protective species. So those were finally added back in 2021, which was necessary for them to be in\u2014reintroduced. And then from there we\u2019ve just got a lot of logistics. They had to effectively reopen a Soviet-era airport that hadn\u2019t been used [for planes] in, like, three decades. For example, a source I talked with at the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity [of] Kazakhstan who\u2019s overseeing the reintroduction, he described having to bring in multiple government agencies and officials in order to make this happen, like passport control, customs\u2014they had to bring in the Ministry of Defense to test the airport\u2019s, like, ability to land a plane. So it was a lot of effort. And then on top of that, there was this just catastrophic flooding in April. So all that aside, the Czech Air Force flew the horses from Germany and from the Czech Republic. They had stopovers in Istanbul and in Baku, and then they finally arrived at this tiny, tiny little Soviet-era airport. Then they had to load the horses with a crane onto trucks. Then the trucks had to drive seven hours. There\u2019s photos of just roads that are half washed away, and there\u2019s just the truck with the horse just kind of driving on by. And now that they\u2019re finally there, the horses are in an enclosure[s], so they\u2019ll stay there until, hopefully, around next April. They want to see them through the tough winter and get them adjusted. So the first winter can be tough. They\u2019ll be monitored, supplemented with food, and then hopefully, depending on pregnancies and everything, then next spring they might be largely on their own. And they\u2019re going to have tracking collars so that the scientists can track their movements and make sure they\u2019re doing okay."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What is the upside to bringing these horses back?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It\u2019s really, really important for the ecosystem. Basically, like, this entire ecosystem, which looks like it\u2019s just grass to the untrained eye\u2014you know, there\u2019s not really any trees; it\u2019s not the kind of thing you think of as, like, beautiful, untouched nature."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But to the trained eye, there\u2019s a ton of biodiversity, and these are really critical and unprotected ecosystems. They sequester a lot of carbon, less so if they\u2019re not grazed. So basically, a healthy ecosystem, you know, the dung of the horses and the antelope and the wild asses will fertilize the soil. Their grazing helps promote the carbon sequestration. The grazing keeps the grasses short, which limits the wildfires."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It also allows the small, little animals that burrow in the ground to access the ground. They also dig, and they can puncture the layers of snow in the winter to provide access to the ground for all the little animals and also to provide access to water. So they\u2019re really crucial. Hopefully, next June, they\u2019ll reintroduce maybe 10 more, and they\u2019re hoping to reintroduce about 30 or 40 more of the horses in the coming years. So hopefully they\u2019ll be able to have a self-sustaining population and keep trotting along."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"One step at a time."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] That was good."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

So it\u2019s kind of like the difference between a feral, stray cat that you find in an alley\u2014as the wild horses\u2014and, like, a wild cat. So these are fairly different."]},{"begin":"170.520","end":"178.160","lines":["That\u2019s very cool. I had a, a cat once that was a stray that I\u2019m pretty sure had a little bit of a not-domesticated cat in him, and he was weird [laughs]."]},{"begin":"178.160","end":"193.560","lines":["[Laughs] Behavior totally changes with domestication, and we can totally see this with the Przewalski\u2019s horses. I would like to do a little experiment, perhaps. I want you to just look up a picture of a Przewalski\u2019s horse and tell me what it looks like to you."]},{"begin":"193.560","end":"228.960","lines":["All right, so I\u2019m looking at a bunch of pictures of Przewalski horses. They definitely are very horselike. I don\u2019t think that if you showed me this in isolation, with no context, I would think there was something wrong with this horse, but they definitely have some distinct features: really thick-necked\u2014definitely look like the bodybuilders of the horse world; also kind of look like a bad sort of buzz cut\u2014really thick, nice head of hair but terrible haircut."]},{"begin":"228.960","end":"232.160","lines":["The mane that sticks straight up looks more like a zebra than a horse."]},{"begin":"232.160","end":"264.120","lines":["Mm, yeah, it\u2019s like, once you\u2019re really looking at them\u2014again, in the context of knowing that it\u2019s a different species\u2014you\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, like, the\u2014parts of it kind of look more like a donkey, parts of it look more like a zebra.\u201d And it\u2019s interesting, you know, in some of these pictures, there are calves\u2014you know, baby Przewalski horses\u2014and they look actually much less standard horse to me. Like them, if I saw them in isolation, I would be like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d [Laughs] \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that baby horse?\u201d \u2019Cause they\u2019re just kind of more gangly."]},{"begin":"264.120","end":"308.000","lines":["These animals have totally different behavior. Despite the fact that a lot of them have been raised in captivity, they\u2019re not comfortable around humans. Like, the zookeepers that take care of them\u2014I talked to a couple\u2014they have to sedate them in order to do anything like draw blood or trim their hooves. They don\u2019t shoe them. They\u2019re not trying to tame them in any way. These are still wild animals, even the ones that are living in captivity. They also have a particular social structure: So they\u2019re group animals, and they have a hierarchy. So there\u2019s one stallion that\u2019s, like, the head of the group, and then he\u2019s got a harem of mares. And so herds can have multiple of these groups, but that\u2019s kind of the general idea. And even within those groups, there\u2019ll be a hierarchy of stallion and harems within them. So, yeah, they\u2019re very particular, they are wild animals, and I now love them."]},{"begin":"308.000","end":"310.880","lines":["Why is the Internet suddenly obsessed with them?"]},{"begin":"310.880","end":"382.480","lines":["I asked myself that when I got the videos served to me by the TikTok algorithm. I have made no indication that I like horses\u2014I\u2019m not exactly sure why it\u2019s given me this, but I\u2019m glad it did because basically, on TikTok, we had two separate accounts that started posting videos in June, claiming that they may have acquired a Przewalski\u2019s horse, which would be very strange because this species is endangered and it\u2019s kept tabs on very closely by scientists. So here\u2019s kind of the timeline: On June 9 a rescue and sanctuary for horses in Utah called Lazy B Equine Rescue and Sanctuary posted a video of a very stocky horse with a mane that sticks straight up running around in a pen, and the text over the video said, \u201cDid we just have a Przewalski mare surrendered?!\u201d They said that they ordered a DNA test and later clarified that that would take up to six weeks, plus postage time. So then two days later a teenager in Colorado, having seen that video from the equine sanctuary, posted a video of a horse that\u2014again, to my untrained eye\u2014looks Przewalski-ish, with the text, \u201cpov, you accidentally rescued a purebred Przewalski stud.\u201dThey called him Shrek, and the other place called theirs Fiona, so that\u2019s kind of cute."]},{"begin":"382.480","end":"392.080","lines":["Going from Przewalski-ish horse\u2014which is a great phrase; thank you for that\u2014to, like, \u201cThis is a purebred stud,\u201d that\u2019s a big jump."]},{"begin":"392.080","end":"425.720","lines":["They said that they were \u201cable to pull hair samples\u201d and that, quote, \u201chis DNA came back as a purebred Przewalski.\u201d They also said they contacted, quote, \u201cthe zoo, as well as the brand board\u201d and that they, quote, \u201chave been told [that] we can keep him.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, it is illegal to own endangered animals without special permits, like the ones that zoos or rescue facilities might have. But these are definitely extraordinary claims, and I certainly cannot speak to the veracity of them, since there\u2019s been no specific evidence provided. Lazy B Equine Rescue and Sanctuary has not claimed that it\u2019s 100 percent sure it\u2019s a Przewalski."]},{"begin":"425.720","end":"431.680","lines":["I can respect asking that question with an interrobang and then seeking confirmation [laughs]."]},{"begin":"431.680","end":"450.600","lines":["I think \u201cconfirmation\u201d is the word of the day. The tone of the videos was like, \u201cAs soon as I saw this horse, I knew it was something rare and extraordinary: a Przewalski\u2019s horse,\u201d so I wanted to know what that meant. And it turns out there\u2019s a ton going on right now with these horses. You know, TikTok rumors aside, they\u2019re actually an incredible conservation story, and there\u2019s important things happening right now with them."]},{"begin":"450.600","end":"458.560","lines":["Well, I\u2019m so glad that TikTok has given us an excuse to talk about them. So what happened to these horses, to backtrack a little bit?"]},{"begin":"458.560","end":"508.720","lines":["They died off in the wild starting around the 1800s, we think. It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly when or why or even where, in parts of the world, they went extinct, but it\u2019s most likely a combination of hunting and poaching from humans and environmental changes that may or may not be attributable to humans. So some were captured and transported to Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s and kept in captivity there. That was kind of before anyone really realized that their numbers were in perilous decline. There was a very sharp decline after World War II, and by the 1960s it became clear that the horses in captivity were the only ones left. So they\u2019re extinct in the wild, and in captivity there were, like, 30 to 40 around the mid-20th century, and only around a dozen of them\u2014maybe a few more\u2014were capable of reproducing. All of the Przewalski\u2019s that we have today are descended from around a dozen."]},{"begin":"508.720","end":"512.040","lines":["Wow, that\u2019s quite a bottleneck, so how did we manage to bring them back?"]},{"begin":"512.040","end":"615.080","lines":["It was definitely a very dire situation. At the time there weren\u2019t really any examples of animals that had gone extinct in the wild but were successfully saved by captive breeding. Those efforts had really just started up, like, for example, with the Arabian oryx\u2014which is a very cool-looking antelope that I would recommend looking it up\u2014that went extinct [in the wild] by 1972.\u00a0 I spoke with Oliver Ryder. He\u2019s of the San Diego Wildlife [Alliance], and he\u2019s been working on this since the 1970s\u2014the San Diego Zoo has been really an important part of it. And one of the things they\u2019ve been trying to do\u2014like you mentioned, a bottleneck of only 12-ish individuals\u2014they really need to make sure they preserve genetic diversity. Now they\u2019ve reached the point where, you know, they\u2019re out of that horrible bottleneck, but they need to make sure that genetic diversity is not lost. So they\u2019ve actually cloned a horse twice, the same horse, from around 1980 the samples were taken. There\u2019s now two foals. One was born in 2020 and then one in 2023. Their names are Kurt and Ollie, both after scientists that were part of the breeding program. And the ultimate goal, though, is not just, like, clone them forever; it\u2019s to reintroduce them to their native habitat. And some of that\u2019s already been done, actually. They\u2019ve been reintroducing them since, like, the 1980s and 1990s into Mongolia, China and Russia, and they\u2019ve actually been doing pretty well: about half of the animals alive today\u2014so a bit over 1,000\u2014live in the wild. And there\u2019s also other ones in reserves\u2014I thought this was so interesting\u2014but the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which will not be deemed habitable for humans for, like, thousands of years, there\u2019s actually a good number of the horses just roaming around there. They reintroduced them in the late 1990s there, and there was this charming study from 2019 that showed that they\u2019re actually hanging out, sleeping in and mating in human-made structures like barns."]},{"begin":"615.080","end":"636.240","lines":["Yeah, I\u2019ve talked about the Chernobyl situation on my other podcast, The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week, before, and it is wild how many studies now are like, \u201cYeah, the radiation was no good, but, like, it turns out that it was less bad than having humans was,\u201d which is, you know, humbling, I would say, humbling. But I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re having fun [laughs]."]},{"begin":"636.240","end":"666.760","lines":["There\u2019s even newer developments. So that was all back in the 1990s and then some of these reintroduction efforts in, like, the 2000s and 2010s. But then most recently they\u2019re back in Kazakhstan. So there was a failed reintroduction effort in Kazakhstan to a national park in 2003. Like, they tried their hardest, but the herds didn\u2019t make it. These horses have been absent from the ecosystem in Kazakhstan for a very long time, but they were finally flown, about seven of them, from the Prague Zoo and a zoo in Berlin in June. The horses are lovely. One of them was named Zorro, which I think is cute. And another one is named Tessa."]},{"begin":"666.760","end":"675.120","lines":["That is very cute. So obviously this has been a huge success, but what were the hurdles they faced\u2014other than the genetic bottleneck we talked about?"]},{"begin":"675.120","end":"776.520","lines":["The hurdles for reintroduction are vast. A lot of the people I talked to were like, \u201cRed tape, paperwork was one of the biggest things.\u201d For example, they were absent for so long from Kazakhstan that they weren\u2019t even classified as a protective species. So those were finally added back in 2021, which was necessary for them to be in\u2014reintroduced. And then from there we\u2019ve just got a lot of logistics. They had to effectively reopen a Soviet-era airport that hadn\u2019t been used [for planes] in, like, three decades. For example, a source I talked with at the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity [of] Kazakhstan who\u2019s overseeing the reintroduction, he described having to bring in multiple government agencies and officials in order to make this happen, like passport control, customs\u2014they had to bring in the Ministry of Defense to test the airport\u2019s, like, ability to land a plane. So it was a lot of effort. And then on top of that, there was this just catastrophic flooding in April. So all that aside, the Czech Air Force flew the horses from Germany and from the Czech Republic. They had stopovers in Istanbul and in Baku, and then they finally arrived at this tiny, tiny little Soviet-era airport. Then they had to load the horses with a crane onto trucks. Then the trucks had to drive seven hours. There\u2019s photos of just roads that are half washed away, and there\u2019s just the truck with the horse just kind of driving on by. And now that they\u2019re finally there, the horses are in an enclosure[s], so they\u2019ll stay there until, hopefully, around next April. They want to see them through the tough winter and get them adjusted. So the first winter can be tough. They\u2019ll be monitored, supplemented with food, and then hopefully, depending on pregnancies and everything, then next spring they might be largely on their own. And they\u2019re going to have tracking collars so that the scientists can track their movements and make sure they\u2019re doing okay."]},{"begin":"776.520","end":"779.480","lines":["What is the upside to bringing these horses back?"]},{"begin":"779.480","end":"792.760","lines":["It\u2019s really, really important for the ecosystem. Basically, like, this entire ecosystem, which looks like it\u2019s just grass to the untrained eye\u2014you know, there\u2019s not really any trees; it\u2019s not the kind of thing you think of as, like, beautiful, untouched nature."]},{"begin":"792.760","end":"793.280","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"793.280","end":"817.120","lines":["But to the trained eye, there\u2019s a ton of biodiversity, and these are really critical and unprotected ecosystems. They sequester a lot of carbon, less so if they\u2019re not grazed. So basically, a healthy ecosystem, you know, the dung of the horses and the antelope and the wild asses will fertilize the soil. Their grazing helps promote the carbon sequestration. The grazing keeps the grasses short, which limits the wildfires."]},{"begin":"817.120","end":"817.160","lines":["Sure."]},{"begin":"817.160","end":"842.360","lines":["It also allows the small, little animals that burrow in the ground to access the ground. They also dig, and they can puncture the layers of snow in the winter to provide access to the ground for all the little animals and also to provide access to water. So they\u2019re really crucial. Hopefully, next June, they\u2019ll reintroduce maybe 10 more, and they\u2019re hoping to reintroduce about 30 or 40 more of the horses in the coming years. So hopefully they\u2019ll be able to have a self-sustaining population and keep trotting along."]},{"begin":"842.360","end":"843.720","lines":["One step at a time."]},{"begin":"843.720","end":"845.080","lines":["[Laughs] That was good."]},{"begin":"845.080","end":"907.720","lines":["That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
