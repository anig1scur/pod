      "text": ": This is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. I\u2019m Karen Hopkin. When someone tells you to \u201csleep on it,\u201d they\u2019re usually suggesting that you avoid making rash decisions. But sleep is also widely known to help you remember things you\u2019ve learned.\u00a0 Now, a nap might seem inconvenient when you\u2019re cramming for an exam. But don\u2019t worry. Because a new study shows that rats who stayed awake after engaging with novel objects could remember seeing those things a week later\u2026sometimes better than rats who slept. That suggests that long-term memories can be laid down without having to lay down. The results appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."

Now, if the rats remember the original item, they should spend less time nosing around it than they do sniffing the new new thing. And it turns out that\u2019s the case for both rats that rested and those that pulled all-nighters\u2026or, all-afternooners. So, in this test, all the rats remembered the objects."

      "author": "Hopkin: ",
      "text": "So, rats who stayed awake were actually better at remembering the original object than their fully rested counterparts\u2013but only when the item was presented in a new location. Rats who\u2019d gotten some shut-eye after their initial study sesh seemed thrown by the change in venue and showed no signs of recognizing the familiar objects when they appeared out of context. That suggests their memories were context-dependent, whereas for the rats who skipped the nap, context didn\u2019t matter."
