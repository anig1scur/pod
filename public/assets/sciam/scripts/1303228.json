      "text": ": Hello Science Talk audience! I\u2019m Katie Hafner, the host of Lost Women of Science. Each season is devoted to the life and work of one scientist who hasn\u2019t gotten the recognition she deserves. We\u2019re calling this season \u201cA Grasshopper in Very Tall Grass,\u201d and it\u2019s all about Klara Dan von Neumann. Klari, as she was called by friends, was one of the world\u2019s first computer programmers. I\u2019ve been writing about computers for a really long time, more than 30 years in fact. I even wrote a history of the internet in 1996, called Where Wizards Stay Up Late. And the wizards? All men. I\u2019ve been on this beat for so long, I thought I knew all the major figures. But then I stumbled upon Klara von Neumann\u2019s name this past year, and I drew a blank. How had I missed her? When I asked some big-hitters in the computer science world about her, they all had the same response: Who? I couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that here was this truly \u201clost\u201d woman of computing\u2013who was nonetheless connected to very well-known histories and people. She was involved in nuclear weapons research, she worked for Los Alamos, she coded for the ENIAC, one of the earliest electronic computers.\u00a0 And she ran in a circle of famous scientists\u2014people like Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and her own husband, John von Neumann, a famous Hungarian scientist who was considered one of the smartest people alive.\u00a0 I thought Klari could teach us a thing or two about this time\u2013the dawn of electronic computers and nuclear warfare. And so we started digging. This season is the result of what we found. Here\u2019s the trailer: [Trailer] UNKNOWN #1: Do I know who Klara von Neumann is? UNKNOWN #2: I\u2019m embarrassed to say I\u2019ve never heard of her. UNKNOWN #1: Wasn\u2019t she, didn\u2019t she have something to do with the weather? UNKNOWN #3: I\u2019ve heard of John von Neumann UNKNOWN #4: I\u2019m not even sure how to pronounce her name. UNKNOWN #5: Was she related to Newman on Seinfeld?"
