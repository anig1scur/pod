But now that water and that tourist economy are in jeopardy. Decades of pollution are destroying ecosystems and choking water with toxic algae. For Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today we\u2019ll hear the first installment of a three-part podcast Fascination from Science Quickly and WBUR. Over the next three Fridays environmental correspondent Barbara Moran will take us on a trip to Cape Cod to show us where the pollution is coming from\u2014and how communities are scrambling to clean it up. Today\u2019s segment is called \u201cLoved to Death.\u201d"},{"author":"Barbara Moran (tape)","text":"So wait\u2014so you\u2019re flipping through your phone. So what is that? That\u2019s your place?"},{"author":"Andrew Gottlieb","text":"So, yes, this was back on June 16."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It looks like somebody poured green paint all over your beach."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s just\u2014the stuff floats up at night and accumulates, pushed by the wind."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Yuck."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Meet Andrew Gottlieb. He runs a nonprofit called the Association to Preserve Cape Cod. He lives by a pond in the town of Mashpee, in a home his family has owned for decades. And he\u2019s showing me photos of his pond last summer full of cyanobacteria, more commonly called \u201ctoxic\u201d or \u201cblue-green\u201d algae. There were other types of algae, too."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Oh, my God, wait\u2014go back to that one. What is that even?"},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"That\u2019s another one. That\u2019s a different part of the [pond]."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It\u2019s like lettuce."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"Two days earlier."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It\u2019s like somebody spilled lettuce."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Ew."},{"author":"Moran","text":"A few months after the toxic algal bloom I\u2019m visiting Andrew and his pond, and the water is crystal clear. We walk down his sloping backyard to a small dock."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m just looking at it, and it\u2019s so clear now, and there\u2019s all these fish. I mean, it looks great."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"Yeah, and the irony is: right before the \u201ccyanobloom\u201d in June, the water was gin clear. It looked great, you know, and we all let ourselves think, like, \u201cHey, maybe this is the year we\u2019re gonna get away with it.\u201d And then [snaps], you know, overnight \u2026"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Overnight came the worst cyanobacteria bloom that he\u2019s ever seen."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"It was pea-soup green."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Ew."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"It started earlier, it was more severe, and it lasted longer than anything we\u2019d experienced."},{"author":"Moran","text":"A cyanobacteria bloom like this one gives off toxins that make the water dangerous for swimming. The town issued a health advisory, closing the pond for four weeks in the middle of summer. During that time Andrew\u2019s sister sent him an old photograph. It showed their dad standing in that same pond decades ago."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"But what got my eye was the fact that in five feet of water, I could see my father\u2019s feet ..."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Because the water was so clear."},{"author":"Gottlieb","text":"Because the water was so clear. And then my father\u2019s great-grandchildren were unable to be in that same water body. It\u2019s awful."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Cyanobacteria blooms and other types of plant, algal and seaweed overgrowth are happening on the cape more and more. So what happened? Why is Cape Cod\u2019s crystal clear water turning pea-soup green? There are two parts to that answer: one scientific; one historical. [CLIP: Theme music and introduction in an episode of the television program America! entitled \u201cThe Cape, the Cod, and the Constant Sea.\u201d Jack Douglas: \u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen, this [is] Jack Douglas.\u201d] [CLIP: \u201cHow We Met,\u201d by Golden Age Radio]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"In the early 20th century most of Cape Cod was sleepy, and homes were spread out. In 1940 there were still only about 37,000 full-time residents on the whole peninsula. [CLIP: Douglas: \u201cCape Cod in Massachusetts is certainly one of the most colorful and best-known capes in all the world; yet we\u2019re told that less than 10 percent of America\u2019s population have ever seen it.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"That started to change after World War II. The population nearly doubled by 1960 and continued to rise in the following decades. Summer tourism boomed. [CLIP: Douglas: \u201cCommercial Street and the adjacent downtown streets look like this during the summer season. The sidewalks are jammed. The traffic is bumper to bumper.\u201d]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"Today there are almost a quarter of a million year-round residents and more than five million annual visitors\u2014which, on the one hand, is great for the cape. The region now pulls in more than $1 billion from tourism every year. But there was a downside to that boom. Back in the 1970s and 1980s people started to notice changes to Cape Cod\u2019s water. Like, in some saltwater bays, the water turned murky, and it smelled bad."},{"author":"Brian Baumgaertel","text":"People started to recognize that the quality of our embayments, our estuaries was degrading."},{"author":"Moran","text":"This is Brian Baumgaertel, director of the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center. He\u2019s an expert on Cape Cod\u2019s water problems."},{"author":"Baumgaertel","text":"The people who were out on the water all the time were observing fish kills, oxygen depletion. They were starting to see areas where eelgrass was starting to die back. And I don\u2019t think they fully understood what was going on at the time, but they knew that there was some sort of human-based impact."},{"author":"Moran","text":"But what\u2014what exactly were humans doing that was impacting Cape Cod\u2019s water? [CLIP: \u201cRunning through the Dark,\u201d by Roots and Recognition] Unraveling that took some scientific detective work. And the work grew more urgent over the years as the water got worse and worse. The Association to Preserve Cape Cod recently analyzed some of the cape\u2019s ponds and most of its bays for its annual water quality report. The nonprofit rated more than a third of the freshwater ponds it analyzed and about 90 percent of the saltwater bays \u201cunacceptable.\u201d To help us understand what happened I reached out to research scientist Javier Lloret\u2014he goes by Javi for short. He works at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole on Cape Cod. And right now he\u2019s sitting on the marshy edge of a large pond, struggling to put on a bulky pair of waders."},{"author":"Javier Lloret","text":"This is probably the most difficult part of my job, having to wear these things."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Today he\u2019s collecting samples from an estuary, an area where saltwater meets fresh. He\u2019s been studying this body of water, Waquoit Bay, for about 10 years. Some parts of the bay are still relatively healthy, and some are really suffering."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"I always compare this to, like, a crime scene. We have the dead body, which is the estuary that is suffering, you know, the consequences of extensive pollution. We also have the weapon: we have figured out that it\u2019s actually the nitrogen."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Let\u2019s stop for a second and make sure we got that. The weapon that\u2019s wrecking Cape Cod\u2019s water is nitrogen. Now, nitrogen is pretty useful as a fertilizer. But when too much of the nutrient gets into the water, it can be disastrous for an ecosystem, spurring the growth of cyanobacteria and all the wrong plants and algae."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"Humans have put a lot of nitrogen into the land. The nitrogen is carried by the groundwater, and basically what it does is that it makes algae to grow, like, out of control."},{"author":"Moran","text":"But where is the nitrogen coming from? There are a lot of potential sources: it could be coming from air pollution, where excess nitrogen settles into the water; or it could be fertilizer runoff from nearby homes and golf courses; or it could be seeping out of septic systems, tanks in people\u2019s yards that hold wastewater from their houses. Which is the biggest source? Well, scientists have figured out the main culprit, the bad guy that\u2019s pouring most of that nitrogen into the cape\u2019s water\u2014and Javi\u2019s gonna show us one of the key ways they did it. [CLIP: Lloret grabs his tools and goes into the water]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"To do that, he needs to collect samples of plants and algae from the mud at the bottom of the bay. He wades into the water with a long metal pole\u2014that\u2019s the rattling you\u2019ve been hearing. It has a spring-loaded scoop on the end. He hits the trigger and grabs a sample from the muddy bottom."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"And let\u2019s see how we\u2019ve done this time. [CLIP: Lloret bangs the metal scoop on a bucket]"},{"author":"Moran","text":"He shakes the sample into a bucket."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"It looks like you got some mud!"},{"author":"Lloret","text":"I did, I got some mud, a little bit of sand and hopefully a little bit of plant life. First we\u2019re going to need to filter."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Javi\u2019s not interested in the mud\u2014he\u2019s interested in the plants and algae living on top of the mud. They can tell us where the nitrogen came from. So he pours the sample into a mesh bag and washes the mud away. [CLIP: Lloret washes the sample]"},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Right, so you\u2019re sort of rinsing it off there, and you end up with\u2014oh, there\u2019s a shell!"},{"author":"Lloret","text":"Yeah, and some algae, right?"},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, some green algae."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"Yeah, so we got a ribbed mussel shell. There\u2019s a little bit of algae."},{"author":"Moran (tape)","text":"Okay, so you\u2019ll take this back to the lab and see what\u2019s actually in there."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Moran","text":"These algae are a kind of macroalgae, better known as seaweed. They grew up feeding on the nitrogen in the water. So the nitrogen is now part of the algae. But\u2014and this is the key science bit\u2014all nitrogen isn\u2019t the same. It comes in different versions, called isotopes. And it turns out that septic tank wastewater has a very distinctive mix of nitrogen isotopes. Air pollution has a different mix, and so does fertilizer. In other words, each possible culprit has a different chemical fingerprint. And that seaweed in Javi\u2019s bucket, it has the offender\u2019s fingerprints all over it."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"So we actually do have that fingerprint of the wastewater all over the ecosystem that allows us to confirm, yeah, the source is precisely the septic systems of the houses."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Remember that Cape Cod population boom? [CLIP: \u201cHow We Met,\u201d by Golden Age Radio] Very few towns built wastewater treatment plants, so most homeowners on the cape had to deal with waste from their toilets, sinks, showers and other appliances on their own\u2014and that meant septic tanks. To this day about 85 percent of Cape Cod properties rely on septic systems, which discharge nitrogen and other nutrients directly into the sandy soil. Decades of scientific detective work have found that those septic systems are the major cause of the cape\u2019s water problems, though fertilizer and stormwater contribute as well. And Javi says nitrogen pollution is an issue well beyond Cape Cod."},{"author":"Lloret","text":"Like, I would consider this one of the major environmental problems of our time. We\u2019re talking about that magnitude of a problem."},{"author":"Moran","text":"Wastewater and chicken manure feed algal blooms on Chesapeake Bay. Agricultural fertilizer runoff flowing down the Mississippi River contributes to the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s annual \u201cdead zone,\u201d a low-oxygen area that can kill fish and other marine life. [CLIP: Theme music] But on Cape Cod, residents are being forced to face the problem head-on. Recently Massachusetts passed tough regulations that are forcing Cape Cod to clean up its water, and it\u2019s costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Those big-ticket solutions\u2014and the controversy surrounding them\u2014will be our focus next Friday in the second part of this three-episode Scientific American\u2013WBUR Fascination miniseries."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thanks for joining us.
