This is your fast-track update on the COVID pandemic. We bring you up to speed on the science behind the most urgent questions about the virus and the disease. We demystify the research, and help you understand what it really means. I\u2019m Tanya Lewis, one of Scientific American\u2019s senior health editors. Josh is taking the week off. Today, I\u2019m going to talk about the \u201ctriple-demic\u201d of COVID, flu and RSV."},{"author":"Tanya Lewis","text":"And I\u2019ll also talk about why it\u2019s so important to get the new COVID booster shot to make sure you\u2019re fully protected. \u2014"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"If it seems like everyone around you is getting sick lately, it\u2019s because they are. But this time, it\u2019s not just COVID making the rounds\u2014it\u2019s also flu and a virus called RSV. COVID cases have been pretty flat lately at around 38,000 cases a day, although these are likely a vast undercount because many people are testing at home. But as we discussed last episode, the new Omicron subvariants could drive a winter surge. The variants all have mutations that make them better at getting around our immunity from vaccination or prior infection."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"But experts think the vaccines should still provide good protection against severe disease and death. Now\u2019s a good time to get your booster if you haven\u2019t already\u2014more on that later. As for flu, it all but disappeared the last couple of years during the pandemic, because people were staying home, wearing masks and social distancing. That\u2019s no longer the case. The southern hemisphere had a pretty bad flu season during their winter (our summer), which usually bodes poorly for the northern hemisphere. Flu cases in the U.S. have already started spiking\u2014especially in the South and New York City."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And hospitals are reporting more positive tests. This is earlier than a typical flu season, which usually peaks between December and February. It\u2019s important to get your flu shot now if you haven\u2019t yet\u2014you can get it at the same time as your COVID booster, or space it out by a few days if you normally get a strong reaction to either shot. But let\u2019s talk about RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. If you\u2019ve never heard of it before, you\u2019re not alone. But you\u2019ve almost certainly had it. Before COVID, most children got RSV before the age of two."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"It usually causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold. But in infants under six months old, it can sometimes be dangerous. That\u2019s because it causes inflammation in the small airways of the lungs, known as bronchiolitis. And in very young children, their airways are so small that this inflammation can make it hard to breathe. More recently, we\u2019ve started to learn that adults over 65 are also at risk of severe RSV. Doctors don\u2019t typically test for it, but about 14,000 adults die from RSV every year\u2014not that many fewer than die from flu every year."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"People whose immune systems are compromised are especially at risk. Like many respiratory viruses, RSV basically disappeared during the pandemic\u2019s first year, but it came roaring back in summer of 2021. That\u2019s because many children had not been exposed to it as infants but were suddenly mingling and getting sick. The same thing is happening now, and hospitals are filling up with RSV. There are no approved treatments for RSV, so it\u2019s usually treated with supportive care."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"As far as vaccines, scientists have been working on those since the 1960s, but faced setbacks after a vaccine trial that resulted in the deaths of two children who got RSV after getting the vaccine. But there are now several promising vaccine candidates.\u00a0 Pfizer just reported that its maternal RSV vaccine, which is given during pregnancy, was more than 80 percent effective at preventing severe RSV in infants under three months. And both Pfizer and GSK have both announced positive results for a vaccine for adults 60 and older."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"At least one of these vaccines will likely be approved by the end of next year, according to Barney Graham, a former NIH scientist who has spent his career working on an RSV vaccine. The best way to protect yourself against RSV is the same as for COVID and flu: stay home when you\u2019re sick if you\u2019re able to, wear a good mask, stay in well-ventilated spaces. In the case of RSV specifically, you should also wash your hands, because you can also get it from touching surfaces. \u2014"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Circling back to COVID, let\u2019s not forget that we\u2019re still in a pandemic. And making sure you\u2019re up to date with your COVID booster is the best thing you can do to protect yourself from getting severely ill. At this point in the pandemic, many of the people dying of COVID are actually older people who are vaccinated, but not up to date on their boosters."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"(That doesn\u2019t mean the vaccines don\u2019t work\u2014it\u2019s just that so many older Americans are vaccinated that a small percentage is still a big number.) I talked to the FDA\u2019s chief medical officer, Hilary Marston, about why the new bivalent booster shots are so important. Unlike the original boosters, the new one targets both the original strain of the virus and the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which are related to those currently circulating."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"\u201cObviously, the importance of booster shots just couldn\u2019t be greater than at this moment, as the weather is getting colder and we\u2019re all inside more,\u201d Marston told me. Everyone five and older is eligible for a booster shot. Experts recommend waiting at least two months since your last booster or three months since a COVID infection in order to get the best immune response. But booster uptake has been truly abysmal. Fewer than 10 percent of eligible Americans have gotten the new shot. And this is frustrating, because we have the tools to prevent people from getting severely ill."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Marston points out that health care workers will bear the brunt of it: \u201cThey\u2019re going to be there to take care of you if you do get sick, of course, but it is just such a strain,\u201d she said. Early data on the new booster shot\u2019s efficacy is still coming out, but it looks promising\u2014including against the new variants. The shot may not stop you from getting COVID, but it just might save your life. \u2014"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Now you\u2019re up to speed.
