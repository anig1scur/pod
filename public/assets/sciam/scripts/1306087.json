This is important because it\u2019ll give you more context when we talk about the U.S. Air Force\u2019s plans to refurbish these silos and deploy new nuclear missiles in them for the next 60 years.

I was maybe 18, 19. I had no clue. I know there was, there was, there was some sites, but I didn\u2019t know what was in the sites."},{"author":"Weber","text":"The silos on the reservation were built between 1961 and 1963.

When I asked my grandma if she remembered the time when the silos arrived, she couldn\u2019t."},{"author":"Malnourie","text":"I still don\u2019t know what's in the sites, you know."},{"author":"Weber","text":"When MY Grandma came back from boarding school, the concrete was already poured, and the missiles were underground, out of sight. So I turned to historians and scholars to shed some light on this troubled story. [CLIP: Cold war newsreel: \u201cBut after the Korean conflict, the Cold War went right on. All along, it had been only too obvious that ever since World War II, the Soviets had been building their military strength. Their threat of world domination was real, and it was increasing all the time.]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"The late 1950s and early 1960s marked a period of intense cold war tensions. The Soviet Union\u2019s launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 triggered the U.S. to build land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1958. The U.S. Air Force prepared to deploy 1,000 nuclear missiles, each carrying a high-yield nuclear warhead, in six bases across the Northern Plains, including 150 in Minot, North Dakota, next to our reservation."},{"author":"David Stumpf: ","text":"One of the criteria at the very beginning was: it needed to be located by a Strategic Air Command base. And so Minot and Grand Forks were already Strategic Air Command bases. Then for the initial deployment of Minuteman 1A, there was a range issue. They also had to have the right soil. All of these sites were thoroughly surveyed for water table and ease and ease of excavation.\u00a0 But they also had to have enough space to put 150 silos. And that\u2019s a lot of room."},{"author":"David Stumpf: ","text":"As noted in my book, that\u2019s tens of thousands of acres and hours between the furthest-away sites and the base."},{"author":"Weber","text":"That\u2019s David Stumpf, author of Minuteman: A Technical History of the Missile That Defined American Nuclear Warfare, published in 2020. Basically, each missile silo field covers this really large area because each silo had to be several miles away from the next one. That\u2019s because in case there was a Soviet nuclear weapon attack, the extra space would have prevented more than one silo from being destroyed.\u00a0 By the way, the 150 silos at Minot cover an area of about 8,000 square miles. That was all really important to know."},{"author":"Weber","text":"But I specifically wanted to understand how some of the silos ended up on tribal land."},{"author":"Weber (tape): ","text":"Did you ever come across like, any, like, documents talking about that while doing your research?"},{"author":"Stumpf","text":"Talking about what, being on a reservation?"},{"author":"Weber (tape)","text":"Mmm-hmm."},{"author":"Stumpf","text":"No, I never came across anything like that, which is an interesting question. But don\u2019t forget, this is back in [the] 1960\u20131965 timeframe. So the sensitivity to some of this was possibly not as great as it is now. Doesn\u2019t make it right\u2014I\u2019m just saying that that was more of a government ... there was an urgency to get these things built that may have overridden any concern about reservation property."},{"author":"Weber (tape): ","text":"I see\u2026."},{"author":"Weber","text":"For me, this resonated deeply. It was a familiar pattern of subjecting my tribe to land grabs and mistreatment. From the 1850s to 1910, our tribe\u2019s ancestral lands were diminished through a series of treaties, agreements, congressional acts and executive orders. By 1886 my tribe had lost most of its land, which it never recovered. In 1910 the current North East segment of the reservation was deemed unused by the tribe and was opened to white settlers\u2019 ownership. This is where the missile silos were eventually built.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not the whole story. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Keith Richotte: ","text":"The federal government was going to break up tribal, communally held lands into individual plots of land and try to essentially turn Native peoples into individual farmers or landholders, and to disrupt tribal, communal, community practices. And because there was more land than there were individual natives who can make claims to land, the federal government felt that it could kill two birds with one stone, as it were, and sell off individual plots of land that were not claimed by Native peoples to non-Native peoples."},{"author":"Weber","text":"That\u2019s Keith Richotte, an associate professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He also happens to be an expert on American federal Indian law and policy and tribal law and a member of the Turtle Mountain Tribe of North Dakota. I wanted to understand the Dawes Act and the Act of June 1, 1910\u2014which opened up tribal lands to homesteading\u2014and also understand what happened."},{"author":"Richotte","text":"Well, to put it succinctly, it meant a lot of land loss."},{"author":"Richotte","text":"It was part of a larger policy movement in the United States at the time, which is often referred to as the allotment era of federal policy. And the basic premise of the allotment era, the federal policy, was to destroy tribes and tribalism. The idea was that the only way to \u201csave\u201d Native peoples from the disastrous forces of civilization was to raise them up to a certain level of civilization."},{"author":"Weber","text":"But this changed. When the missiles were deployed in the 1960s, the North East Segment of the Fort Berthold reservation wasn\u2019t considered part of the tribe\u2019s land. But through a court case in 1972, The City of New Town, North Dakota v. the U.S., it was deemed that the land had always been part of the reservation\u2014per the Act Of March 3, 1891. The only thing was that when our tribe recovered lands that had been taken from us, we also inherited missile silos that we never agreed to having in the first place."},{"author":"Weber","text":"I asked Keith what the missiles on the reservation today meant for the tribe legally."},{"author":"Richotte","text":"The tribe doesn\u2019t really have much recourse other than perhaps making some claim of nuisance or that it disrupts the tribe\u2019s ability to use its land in the way that it wants. But my guess is you\u2019re going to have a real hard time in American courts making the argument that these missile silos are such a nuisance that the tribe should be able to exclude them, considering what they ostensibly mean for national security."},{"author":"Weber (tape): ","text":"Well, that\u2019s kind of, like, doom-and-gloom. Um, but\u2026."},{"author":"Richotte","text":"Well, that\u2019s Indian law."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Before we continue, I want to pause and give you a sense of the geography of the Fort Berthold reservation. The rez is divided into six segments: North, North East, East, South, West and Four Bears (the tribal government center). The missiles were built on the North East Segment. This is the part that was unlawfully opened to outside settlers in 1910 and recovered by my tribe in 1972, 10 years after the missile silos were built. But there\u2019s another part of this story that we haven\u2019t really talked about yet."},{"author":"Weber","text":"In 1944 the Army Corps of Engineers began to build a series of dams on the Missouri River for the conservation, control and use of water resources. One of these is the Garrison Dam, which was completed just downriver from our reservation in 1953.\u00a0 At that time, the dam flooded one quarter of the reservation. The flood destroyed 95 percent of the Tribes\u2019 farmlands, homes, towns and graves; displaced our people in and out of the reservation; and reshaped the landscape for decades."},{"author":"Angela Parker: ","text":"I think it was kind of a classic example of environmental racism."},{"author":"Weber","text":"That\u2019s Angela Parker, an assistant professor of history at the University of Denver and, like me, an enrolled member of the MHA Nation. She wrote her Ph.D. dissertation\u2014soon to be a book \u2014 on the construction of the dam."},{"author":"Parker","text":"The tribe did propose an alternate dam site, but that would have flooded out much less tribal land and would have impacted the non-Native farmers above Fort Berthold much more, and so that was just sort of dismissed without much thought, right, by the, by the Army Corps of Engineers."},{"author":"Weber (tape)","text":"So what happened after people moved? Like, after, like, it, the flood, started coming in, the water slowly started, like, coming in\u2014what, what were people doing?"},{"author":"Parker","text":"Yeah, it was so chaotic. And the communities were just in chaos. There was no infrastructure, sometimes there was no roads, you know. They had to, like, go out and dig wells. They had to move houses down from the bottom lead out to the allotments. There was no electricity for a lot of the reservation, and there were no schools. So a lot of kids who were born during that time period got sent out to boarding schools because we were already struggling economically."},{"author":"Parker","text":"So, like, my mom got sent out to Wahpeton when she was eight years old, and that was very common for a lot of people, you know, at Fort Berthold just because their parents were doing anything they could to make sure that they had access to an education."},{"author":"Weber","text":"For me, this was the final connection between the flooding of the reservation, the sending of my grandmothers to Indian boarding schools, the land grab and the missile silos."},{"author":"Parker","text":"At the time, right, when the U.S. government is coming in and sort of appropriating this land for these silos, right, people had already been through the wringer. You know, our society structures had held us together for so long, but when the dam came in, it was like chaos. It was like untying a string, and, like, all of a sudden, everything\u2019s falling all over the place. But I think what saved us, you know, after smallpox, was that we could band together still; we\u2019re living close to each other."},{"author":"Parker","text":"That was not as possible once people got pushed off to allotments after the Garrison Dam. After the Garrison Dam, that was probably the perfect time for the military to come in and decide, like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll just take this.\u201d"},{"author":"Weber","text":"It was only eight years later, as the Three Affiliated Tribes were recovering from losing their homes and adapting to life after the Garrison Dam, that the U.S. government decided to build nuclear missile silos on the lands that it had grabbed in 1910\u2014lands that many in the tribe had now relocated to."},{"author":"Gwen Hostler","text":"I was like two, three years old when the dam went through. And I\u2019m, I was pretty young, but I remember that they were told, you know, they had to right away \u201cget your stuff together.\u201d So it was a quick, quick move because the water was coming in. I don\u2019t know any more than that, just from what, you know, I was told by my grandmother in them. So that\u2014it sounded like they weren\u2019t given much time to move up."},{"author":"Weber","text":"That\u2019s Gwen Hostler, a cousin of my Grandma Debra. She lives in the South segment of the reservation. There isn\u2019t any direct road access to this place from any other parts of the reservation because of the flooding. So, we went off rez and drove three hours to meet her."},{"author":"Hostler","text":"The lake just tore a lot of families apart, you know."},{"author":"Weber","text":"I went to the Garrison Dam myself. It\u2019s not exactly what I expected it to look like. I thought you\u2019d be able to see the water flowing, like, rushing down. But it doesn\u2019t look like much. The Army Corps of Engineers sees this as a great feat of human capability and engineering capability. But the Three Affiliated Tribes see it as the end of the old ways of life.\u00a0 [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"In response to this reporting, the Army Corps of Engineers sent two pamphlets and a statement that these publications, quote, \u201chave been available for years\u201d and that they, quote, \u201cinclude information on the displacement of tribes and communities as a result of the construction of Garrison Dam and the subsequent flooding that formed Lake Sakakawea.\u201d These pamphlets, however, never mention the MHA Nation by name, nor do they specifically mention the flooding of the Garrison Dam."},{"author":"Weber","text":"They only say that, quote, \u201ctribal and state lands were taken, uprooting whole communities.\u201d When Princeton University\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Philippe and I visited the Garrison Dam on June 23, 2023, we and looked through 20 pamphlets, and neither of us saw these two particular publications or any others that recognized the MHA Nation or mentioned the flooding of the Fort Berthold reservation.
