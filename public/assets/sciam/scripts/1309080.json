Back in 2013 a chilling episode of the hit show Black Mirror called \u201cBe Right Back\u201d followed a grieving woman who came to rely on an imperfect AI copy of her dead partner. More recently the idea of digital copies of the deceased even made it into a comedy with Amazon Prime\u2019s show Upload."},{"author":"","text":"That shift from psychological horror to satire makes sense because in the decade or so between the premieres of those shows, the idea of preserving our dead with digital tools has become way less hypothetical. There\u2019s now a growing industry of what some experts call \u201cgriefbots,\u201d which offer AI-powered mimics of users\u2019 departed loved ones. But these services come with a whole host of ethical concerns\u2014for both the living and the deceased."},{"author":"","text":"My guest today is Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska. She\u2019s a research fellow at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. Her research explores how new technologies like these bots are reshaping our understanding of death, loss and grief."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Katarzyna","text":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska: Thanks so much for having me. I\u2019m super excited about this."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So how did you first get interested in studying, as you call them, \u201cgriefbots\u201d or \u201cdeadbots\u201d?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"I\u2019m always laughing that this topic has found me. It wasn\u2019t me who was searching for this particular topic; it was, rather, the other way around. When, I was still a student we were asked to prepare an assignment. I was studying media studies and with elements of art and performance, and the topic was very broad, simply \u201cbody.\u201d So I did my research, and I\u2019m\u2014I was looking for some inspiration, and that was the very first time I came across a website called Eterni.me, and I was absolutely hooked by this idea that someone was offering me digital immortalization."},{"author":"","text":"It was almost a decade ago, and I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s so creepy; it\u2019s fascinating at the same time. It\u2019s strange, and I really want to know more.\u201d So I prepared that assignment, then I chose digital immortality as a subject for my master\u2019s, and master\u2019s evolved into Ph.D., and after 10 years [laughs] I\u2019m still in this field working professionally on this topic."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I imagine that the sort of technologies behind the idea of digital immortalization have changed a lot in 10 years. What kinds of advances are powering this field?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"So actually, 10 years ago commercial companies sold promise ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"And today we have a real product. So that\u2019s the big change. And we have generative AI that makes the whole thing possible. We have the whole know-how and technological infrastructure to make it happen."},{"author":"","text":"To create this kind of technology, to create your postmortem avatar, what you need is the combination of two things: huge amount of personal data and AI. And so if you want to create this avatar, you need to grant access to your personal data to the commercial company. And it means that you share your video recordings, your messages, your audio recordings, and then AI makes sense of it ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"And [tries] to find links between different pieces of information and extrapolates the most possible answer you would give in a certain context. So obviously, when your postmortem avatar is speaking, it\u2019s just the, it\u2019s just the, the prediction of: \u201cHow would that person react in this particular moment and in this particular context?\u201d It\u2019s based on a very sophisticated calculation, and that\u2019s the whole magic behind this."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what does this landscape look like right now? What kinds of products are people engaging with and how?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"Mostly what\u2019s available on the market are postmortem avatars or griefbots or deadbots. We use these different names to cover, actually, the same type of technology: so virtual representation of yourself that can be used long after your biological death. I often use this phrase borrowed from Debra Bassett that we live in a moment when we can be biologically dead but at the same time virtually present and socially active. So there are many companies, mostly based in United States\u2014and United States seems to be, like, the epicenter for incubating this idea and distributing this whole narrative around digital immortality across the world. So we have different start-ups and companies who offer this type of, of services, either in the form of bots or holograms."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And are we seeing any differences culturally in, in how different people are reacting to and engaging with these products?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"So that\u2019s the main question that I am trying to pursue right now because I\u2019m leading a project that is called \u201cImaginaries of Immortality in the Age of AI: An Intercultural Analysis\u201d. And in this project we try to understand how people from different cultural backgrounds perceive the idea of digital immortality, so Poland, India and China are our three selected countries for this research, because it\u2019s not enough to hear only a perspective and to know the perspective from the West and this dominant narrative."},{"author":"","text":"So we are still in the data-collection phase, so I can only share some observations, not yet findings. What we know for sure is that for experts and nonexperts that we work in these three locations\u2014when I say experts I mean people who work at the intersection of death, technology, grief: so people representing very different fields and industries, like palliative care professionals, academics, people who work in funeral industries, spiritual leaders; so people who could help us understand what digital immortality may mean in this context."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"So definitely, what we know for sure [is] that digital immortality is perceived as a technology that can profoundly change the way we understand and we experience death and immortality. And experts agree on that we need much more discussion on this and we need much more ethical guardrails and framework that will help us to make sense of this new phenomenon, that we need much more [well-thought-out] regulations and responsible design. We also need protective mechanisms for users of these technologies because at the moment there is no such thing, and it might be surprising at the same time, super alarming. And also that we need collaboration, and we need collaboration because there is no such thing as in one expert in digital immortality, [one] person who can thoroughly address all the issues and dilemmas and questions. And we need shared expertise, or collective expertise, to better grasp all the challenges that we are facing at the moment."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, obviously this sounds like a really complex issue, but what would you say are some of the biggest and most pressing ethical concerns around this that we need to figure out?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"So the list is pretty long, but I would say the most pressing issues are the question on consent. Because when you create postmortem avatar for yourself, so you are data donor, the situation seems to be pretty straightforward because if you do this, we can assume that you explicitly consent to use your personal data. But what about the situation when we have a third party engage in this situation? So what if I would like to create a postmortem avatar of my mother? Do I have the right to share my private correspondence with her and to share this with the commercial company and let them make use of and reuse this material?"},{"author":"","text":"And another variation on the question of consent is something that we called the \u201cprinciple of mutual consent.\u201d We use this in the article that I co-authored with my colleague from CFI, Dr. Tomasz Hollanek. We introduced this idea because I think that we quite often lose sight of the fact that when we create postmortem avatar, it\u2019s not only about us ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"Because we are creating this for specific users, for the intended users of this technology, which is often our family and friends, and the thing is that they may not be ready to use them and they may not be so enthusiastic about this. For some people it can definitely bring comfort, but for others it can be additional emotional burden, so that\u2019s why we think we should be able to create a situation when different engaged parties will consent to be exposed to these technologies in the first place so they can decide whether they want to use these technologies in the long or short term."},{"author":"","text":"The other thing: data profit exploitation. Digital immortality is a part of commercial markets. We have the term \u201cdigital afterlife industry,\u201d which I think speaks volumes where we are. Ten years ago it was a niche\u2014niche that has evolved into fully fledged industry: digital afterlife industry."},{"author":"","text":"Our postmortem relationships are definitely monetized, and we can imagine situations that commercial companies will go even further and will use these platforms, for example, to sell us products. And these griefbots can be a very sneaky product-placement space. So data profit exploitation, but also I think we should bear in mind that there are particularly vulnerable groups of potential users that, in my opinion, shouldn\u2019t be exposed to these technologies at all, like children, for example."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"We don\u2019t have empirical-based research that could help us to understand how these technologies influence grieving process, but I think that in this particular case, we should act preemptively and protect the most vulnerable because I don\u2019t think children are ready to cope with grief or to go through grieving process being accompanied by AI\u2026."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"and a griefbot of, I don\u2019t know, their parents. It may be devastating and really hard to cope with."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely. We\u2019ve talked about the obvious ethical concerns. Do we know anything or do you have any personal thoughts about whether there could be benefits to technologies like these?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"I think they could serve as a form of interactive archives. It\u2019s very risky to use them in a grieving process, but when we put them in different context, as a source of knowledge, I think that\u2019s a potential ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"Positive use of this technology: so that we can learn from some scientists that were immortalized through this technology."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, and maybe even in personal use, less like, \u201cOh, this is my grandmother who I can now have personal conversations with while grieving,\u201d and more like, \u201cOh, you can go ask your great-grandmother about her childhood in more of a, like, family history kind of way.\u201d Does that make sense?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"Yes, absolutely, absolutely. So to,to change the accents and to not necessarily focus on grieving process, which is a very risky thing, but rather try to build archives ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"And new sources of knowledge, accessible knowledge."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, very cool. What do you think is important for consumers to keep in mind if they\u2019re considering engaging with griefbots or deadbots?"},{"author":"Nowaczyk-Basi\u0144ska","text":"So first of all, that it\u2019s not universal remedy. It works for some people, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to work the same way for me because I\u2019m a different person, I go through the grieving process entirely different. So definitely, that\u2019s a very personal thing, and grief is also a very personal and intimate experience, so we should keep in mind that it\u2019s not for everyone."},{"author":"","text":"Second, that these technologies, [laughs] it\u2019s only technology. It\u2019s not on the other side. It\u2019s not your deceased loved one. It\u2019s a very sophisticated technology that impersonate this person. And also that this technology can be addictive\u2014I mean that this technology is designed in a way to keep you engaged, and you can be quite easily manipulated. So I think commercial companies should ensure that users are aware of the fact that they contact with technology through, for example, disclaimers. But at the same time we see that we have very conflicting interests here because what commercial company wants is to engage us and, like, keep us in this [relationship]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Thank you so much for coming on to talk through this with us.
