In this series, we\u2019re asking what we can learn from those with marginalized experiences to explore sexuality, find the female orgasm and illuminate asexuality. In this episode, we\u2019ll take you inside the world of BDSM, which stands for \u201cbondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism.\u201d Practitioners say that, when done with proper consent and communication, rough sex can be not only pleasurable but also healing."

But as rough sex moves away from the margins, more people are engaging in it without educating themselves. At the same time, researchers say that BDSM can be liberating and healing, especially for people with a history of trauma."

In 2021 she found that, of about 5,000 undergraduate students who participated in a confidential survey, almost 80 percent of those with a current partner reported engaging in rough sex, an umbrella term that includes choking, spanking, smothering, name-calling, and more. In her study, people who self-identified as bisexual were nearly twice as likely to report greater frequency of rough sex, and transgender and nonbinary participants also reported greater frequency and enjoyment of rough sex. (The authors did not ask how often participants had sex in general, though, or to what extent rough sex behaviors were communicated about and consensual.)"

And so when you look at more, like, queer communities, there\u2019s an openness to saying, well, like, \u201cLet me try it this way\u201d or \u201cHow would you like to try this?\u201d"

      "text": "Frankly, most doctors will tell you, like, choking in general is something that probably everybody should stay away from.... There is no, like, zero-risk way of engaging in choking\u2014because it still involves either, you know, reducing blood flow to and from the brain or reducing airflow, depending on how people do it, or both. And so that\u2019s not good for the brain either in the short term or the long term. But a lot of people don\u2019t want to hear that. Some people describe psychological feelings, of feeling on either the giving or receiving end that, like..., \u201cI have my partner\u2019s life in my hands. And of course, I\u2019m trustworthy\u201d\u2014or feeling, like, the eroticism of your partner having your life in their hands."

Not long after, her team did a survey of randomly sampled students and noticed a sharp rise in participation: among the nearly 1,800 respondents who reported having a romantic or sexual partner... around 80 percent of the students reported having engaged in rough sex."

So rough sex includes things like light spanking, hard spanking, you know, smothering, choking or strangulation, name-calling, all sorts of things. So I think a good first question is just asking somebody what they\u2019re into and not pressuring anybody to be into anything they\u2019re not and also feeling comfortable standing up for yourself if you\u2019re not interested in something that your partner is interested in. It\u2019s okay to say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s just too risky for me\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that.\u201d"
