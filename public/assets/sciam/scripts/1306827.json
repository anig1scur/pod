This week, we\u2019re revisiting some of our favorite episodes \u2013 and honestly this one is one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever worked on. It\u2019s the first in a three-part series on artificial intelligence making music. Together we\u2019re going to hear a very unique song, and trace the technical revolution that made its creation possible. And actually, it\u2019s the perfect time to be coming back to this, because the consequences of that revolution are getting very real, very quickly. Just recently, a startup released a tool people are calling the \u201cChat GPT of music.\u201d I\u2019ve played around with it a bit, and honestly it\u2019s left me \u2026 kind of speechless. I didn\u2019t know that AI-generated audio could sound this polished.\u00a0 Even having reported this series a year ago\u2014even knowing something like this had to be coming\u2014I still feel, just, so caught off guard. So I hope you enjoy the episode, and check out the rest of the series \u201cAI Gets Musical\u201d on scientificamerican.com. [Clip: Show theme music]"

[CLIP: Notes on piano]\u00a0 And the melody\u2014I\u2019m not even sure what instrument sounds like that. As it turns out, no instrument sounds like that.

And it\u2019s under that moniker that he created the piece you heard a minute ago with the help of a nonhuman assistant\u2014machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. See, artificial intelligence algorithms are musicians now. Welcome to part one of a three-part \u201cFascination\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re calling these Science, Quickly miniseries, FYI\u2014on how artificial intelligence is getting deep into the world of music. So about that whole AI is a musician now thing: I\u2019m mostly kidding\u2014these computer algorithms are really reflections of our own creativity and ingenuity, no matter how advanced. They are given a bunch of data to learn from, and they can detect subtle patterns that can be used to make useful predictions, not just in music but in many artistic endeavors. And they\u2019re getting really good at it. In fact, these algorithms are advancing so fast that it\u2019s beginning to feel like they\u2019re doing way more than just pattern recognition. ChatGPT, a large language-learning model AI, can compose a poem about estate tax or methamphetamine. It can create a recipe for \u201cFrench-style chicken thighs with carrots and cream.\u201d Or it can just make your job application cover letters suck less. Dall-E 2, a deep-learning model, can make fantastical art from simple language prompts such as \u201ca bowl of soup that is a portal to another dimension in the style of Basquiat.\u201d And now people such as Hanoi are using machine learning to challenge the musical chokehold that Western Europe has had on basically all of us. That brings us back to \u201cEnter Demons & Gods\u201d\u2014Hanoi\u2019s machine-learning-assisted composition that started off the episode. In 2022 he submitted it to an international competition called the AI Song Contest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He won. [CLIP: Recording of award ceremony]"

Even if you haven\u2019t heard that technical name before, you\u2019ve definitely heard it in action\u2014it describes the 12 repeating notes you can play on a piano and the notes underlying basically all of Western pop and classical music. See, you have an octave\u2014where the higher note is exactly twice the frequency of the lower note \u2026 [CLIP: Piano plays an octave of A at 440 and 880 hertz] Western music divides that octave into 12 notes spread apart at equal ratios.\u00a0 [CLIP: Ascending chromatic A scale on the piano] Hanoi knows this tuning system well because his mom encouraged him to play the piano as a kid, like so many people around the world.\u00a0"

      "text": "It\u2019s true. Those 12 notes of the piano can sound natural and normal if you grew up mostly listening to Western music. Now hear me out; I\u2019m going to geek out for a second. I want you to stay with me. The note on the piano called A4 sounds like this \u2026 [CLIP: 440 Hz tone] \u2026 typically is set at the frequency of 440 hertz, meaning the sound wave oscillates 440 times a second. But there\u2019s nothing special about that 440 number. It was only first standardized in the 1930s. And some orchestras, like the New York Philharmonic, tune to 442 Hz. That\u2019s a small enough difference that our ears basically can\u2019t hear it. But during the Baroque period, around the 1600s, that same note was set at 415 Hz.\u00a0 [CLIP: 415 Hz tone] All of this is to say that pitch is a spectrum, and there are literally infinite notes you could tune an instrument to play. There\u2019s no real reason why we have to divide the octave into 12 notes rather than, say, 22 or five. And there\u2019s no real reason that we have to space those notes out evenly through the octave, either. There are plenty of musicians who argue that the 12 notes of the Western scale sound better when they\u2019re not spread apart at equal ratios. And finally, we don\u2019t even have to base tuning systems around octaves at all. Sure, the laws of physics and the biology of our ears might predispose us to find the octave pleasing, but we human beings are creative and flexible creatures.\u00a0 So, given these infinite possibilities, it makes sense that cultures around the world choose to chop up musical space differently.

That fits seven notes in the same amount of musical space as Western music fits 12\u2014though that\u2019s definitely an oversimplification of the complexities of Thai tuning. Similarly, the pi nai, the oboe-like instrument played at Thai boxing matches, plays notes and intervals that can\u2019t be mimicked on the piano. In fact, if you take this pi nai trill \u2013...

      "text": "That\u2019s where machine learning comes in. See, there\u2019s been a pretty big revolution in how it works with music. For a long time, the music we made with AI was limited to just those 12 notes on the piano. That\u2019s because raw audio files themselves are massive, encoding tons of information. There are typically 44,000 samples every second for good quality recording\u2014double that for a stereo recording that plays different tracks in each ear of your headphones. So, let\u2019s see, if you tried to have an A.I. chew through Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d \u2026\u00a0 [CLIP: Led Zeppelin\u2019s Stairway to Heaven] \u2026 it would have over 42 million data points to process. That\u2019s just too much for an AI algorithm. So those older algorithms needed something simpler. All they could handle was a symbolic, text-based representation that gets the gist of the notes being played\u2026 [CLIP: MIDI version of Led Zeppelin\u2019s Stairway to Heaven] \u2026 like notes written on a page to tell you how you might play a song on the piano.
