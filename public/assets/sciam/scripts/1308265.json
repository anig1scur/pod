What used to be a post-turkey American shopping tradition has ballooned into a global phenomenon of November sales. If you\u2019re feeling the urge to do some serious damage to your bank account this week, you\u2019re definitely not alone\u2014and you shouldn\u2019t blame yourself; these sales are designed and marketed to send you into a shopping spiral."},{"author":"","text":"For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. My guest today is Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, professor of consumer psychology at Anglia Ruskin University. She\u2019s here to tell us all about the psychology behind Black Friday shopping and what we can do to protect ourselves and our wallets."},{"author":"","text":"Thank you so much for joining us to chat today."},{"author":"Cathrine Jansson-Boyd","text":"Thank you for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So your expertise is in consumer psychology. Could you tell us a little bit about what kinds of questions you try to answer in your research?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"So I\u2019ve been really lucky, in terms of my research career, that I have been able to look at very many different approaches to consumer behaviors. And generally what I\u2019m interested in is trying to tap into aspects of human behavior that really hasn\u2019t been addressed before. And this encompasses tactile input, for an example\u2014which, when I started my career a long time ago, we knew very little about\u2014so how you can use touch to change people\u2019s perception. So I have done quite a lot on that."},{"author":"","text":"I have also looked at how to reduce energy consumption. That\u2019s something that tends to be notoriously difficult to do because people often are not conscious of how they\u2019re using energy. So that presents quite a lot of challenge."},{"author":"","text":"And along very similar lines I\u2019ve also been involved in trying to reduce food waste within people\u2019s homes\u2014again, often something that happens subconsciously; people don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re throwing away food. So I\u2019ve looked at quite a lot of environmentally linked aspects of consumption, but I\u2019ve also looked at more kind of pure commercialized elements such as: How do we make a tea box more appealing? What is it that\u2019s gonna make someone buy that? How do you communicate a specific type of marketing message, depending on what it is you\u2019re trying to sell?"},{"author":"","text":"I've also looked quite a lot [at] aesthetics\u2014so looking at the design elements, what can we do to change people\u2019s perception? How do we kind of make it congruent with their actual beliefs so that people see something and then think, \u201cWow, that\u2019s very attractive,\u201d because people tend to buy things because they\u2019re attractive, but equally, actually, \u201cThis is a functionable thing\u201d?"},{"author":"","text":"So, you know, if you\u2019re buying a Hoover\u2014or a vacuum cleaner, sorry\u2014you tend to look at the aesthetics of it, and people go, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t if you buy a vacuum cleaner,\u201d but actually you do, very much so. But equally you need to show it\u2019s a functionable thing, something that, actually, people need, so that you kind of create a congruent message."},{"author":"","text":"So that\u2019s some of the things that I\u2019ve done. So it\u2019s quite diverse, to be honest [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, I could ask you a million different questions [laughs] about the things you just mentioned, but today we are gonna talk about holiday shopping and sales specifically. What is it about shopping sales and discounts that, like, really messes with our heads and, and impacts our behavior?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"Well, so we\u2019re conditioned, to start off with, to look at price. So that\u2019s something that consumers are very much driven by, regardless of what it is that they\u2019re purchasing. So because you are very much in tune with that, when you come across something that you think is a bargain, you tend to get quite excited. So there\u2019s an adrenaline rush going through your system."},{"author":"","text":"And we also know through [functional magnetic resonance imaging] scans\u2014so when we\u2019re looking at the brain\u2014if you are quite excited about a price, the same part of the brain that deals with general pleasurable experiences is actually activated ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"So, so that tells us, when we see something that\u2019s got a really good price, not only do we experience the adrenaline rush, but we actually experience genuine pleasure. So you couple that with potential excitement or thinking, \u201cOh, you know, there\u2019s a sale; that means if I don\u2019t grab it now, I could be missing out,\u201d makes people even more excitable, and potentially the combination can [lead] to not making such a good decision in terms of consumption, unfortunately."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm, and what are some of the tricks that stores and brands use to, you know, sort of hijack our psychology?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"So something they often do, when we talk about special promotions or just wanting to kind of get a hook into the consumer to make sure that they don\u2019t actually wander off, so to speak, is that they really build around what we refer to as \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d commonly referred to as \u201cFOMO.\u201d And it works really, really well."},{"author":"","text":"Like I said, if you have sort of this pleasurable part of the brain that\u2019s activated, together with a feeling or emotion of excitement, and then you think you are gonna miss out\u2014so they might say something like \u201conly in the next 24 hours,\u201d \u201cthe last three items left online\u201d\u2014those kind of messaging makes people really think, \u201cOh, my gosh, if I don\u2019t grab it now, that\u2019s it.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And, of course, this works equally well in a real retail setting. \u2019Cause you just think about something like Black Friday: you know, you\u2019ll walk into a big store, and there is a pile of things, and you can see everybody taking them, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cOh, my gosh, I\u2019m gonna miss out. Everybody\u2019s grabbing one, so quick, grab one.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"And that\u2019s, of course, sometimes\u2014very sadly\u2014but that is sometimes how we see fights breaking out in retail environments, which is\u2014it seems crazy, but this is purely the emotion of excitement and really being scared that you are gonna miss out on this thing. So people really go for it, and, you know, they will then yank them back and forth until they actually get their hands on it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. Is there anything uniquely tricky about Black Friday in terms of how it changes our behavior?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"Well, for the moment, I think Black Friday has been around for quite a while now, and this, of course, has almost become a global phenomena, which is interesting, bearing in mind that it was purely American to start off with ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"But what we have seen, because it has been around for a while, is that people are becoming a little bit more skeptical. So quite a lot of surveys demonstrate that most people are geared up to engage with Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but people are still a little bit more cautious than they used to be. \u2019Cause a lot of the time they\u2019re questioning, \u201cAre we really getting a, a real bargain?\u201d So that means the marketeers have to work a little bit harder. They have to send more messages saying, you know: \u201cPre-promotions.\u201d \u201cThis is only happening for 24 hours.\u201d \u201cWe are letting you know first so you can get in there before everybody else,\u201d if it\u2019s online, for an example. Or maybe you\u2019ll get a special invite to a shop. Or they\u2019re saying, right, if you come and queue at this time in the morning, you\u2019re likely to be first through the door."},{"author":"","text":"So they\u2019re really trying to kind of entice you as much as possible. \u2019Cause, of course, consumers aren\u2019t stupid. They know this is not a new thing. They know that they\u2019re potentially being kind of teased to come along. But if you do a message enough times in terms of, \u201cThis is just 24 hours,\u201d people will kind of\u2014first time, maybe, they\u2019ll go, \u201cYeah, whatever, I\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d Second time you think, \u201cOkay, 24 hours, maybe I should actually have a think about whether I should engage in this.\u201d And the third time you start getting worried because this kind of adrenaline rush is building up and you\u2019re getting more and more concerned about the fear of missing out. And eventually you kind of give in to it, and there you are, first in line, or, you know, hitting the button, going, \u201cI\u2019m buying this,\u201d when they actually finally release the items online."},{"author":"","text":"So it just means that they work a bit harder, and if you want to stay away from it, what I always say, especially with continuous emails and things: Just don\u2019t read them. Switch off your computer, especially the 48 hours before Black Friday or Cyber Monday starts, and just ignore it because otherwise you\u2019re very likely to be swept away in, in the kind of slight hysteria around it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, no, it\u2019s very tricky. I mean, I try to really avoid overconsumption, and I always try to be very careful about being like, you know, \u201cAre there specific brands, were there things I\u2019ve had my eye on for a while and I know they\u2019re doing discounts?\u201d but I caught myself the other day\u2014that list had gotten kind of long [laughs], and I was like, \u201cMm, I think maybe I\u2019ve been looking at too many emails and I need to go back and pare that back down to things that are actually sensible.\u201d Yeah, it is tough."},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"But at least you\u2019re doing the right thing in the sense that you\u2019re making a list and you\u2019re kind of thinking it through. And that\u2019s another way of actually dealing with this sort of excitement is if you really are gonna buy something, make a list: \u201cWhat do I need?\u201d Because, of course, there could be bargains to be had, but you have to be a sensible shopper so you don\u2019t let your kind of emotions taking over. And making a list, even putting a price next to it, compare three months prior to Black Friday or Cyber Monday and see, actually, what are the prices now? Because, of course, something that is quite commonly used is that prices go up just before to come back down again, which means that, yes, it is lower, they can advertise this as 50 percent off, but it wasn\u2019t actually that much higher to start off with ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"So by monitoring that, as well as thinking about, \u201cDo I need this? What am I prepared to pay for this?\u201d Make a list and just tick the list off as you go, and when you are at the end of it, stop. Just don\u2019t buy anything else."},{"author":"","text":"So, yes, it sounds like you\u2019re doing the right thing, so you clearly got the hang of it anyway [laughs]."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Well, and speaking of that, you know, what other advice do you have for people who are trying to shop smartly and sustainably? You know, I feel like, especially this year, you know, prices have been high, a lot of folks are struggling financially, so there is that very real motivation to go out and, and get a good deal. So other than making a list and, you know, trying to plan ahead that way, what do you recommend that folks do to protect themselves from, you know, the sort of dark side of these sales?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"I think the list is number one. I think secondly, if you have any doubts when it comes to purchasing something, simple: Don\u2019t buy it. Don\u2019t go there. Just kind of take a step back and say, \u201cRight, I\u2019m thinking about buying this.\u201d Now, if you\u2019re online, go, I don\u2019t know, make a cup of tea, have a cup of coffee, you know, just go and wash your hair, whatever it is, but take a few minutes away. And when you come back the likelihood is that your adrenaline rush has settled, and therefore you\u2019re not gonna want to buy the item anymore."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"So be sensible\u2014actually really think it through. But you can only do that by taking a step back."},{"author":"","text":"The same thing in a shop: if you are there fighting over an item, okay, grab the item just in case you really, really want it; walk off with it. But then have a little walk around the shop for a few, you know, a few minutes. Look at the item a couple of times and say to yourself, \u201cDo I really want this?\u201d The likelihood is that you\u2019re gonna say, \u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and you will kind of put it back down again and let someone else take it."},{"author":"","text":"But you really need to let your brain have a bit of space; that is the key. Because otherwise it\u2019s just gonna kind of pump out this information to you that, \u201cActually, you need this, you need this, you need this,\u201d because it\u2019s the pleasure of it. And you can\u2019t really afford to take the risk; like you said, many people are\u2014really struggled financially recently. And that\u2019s, of course, a global phenomena, which is an issue. And therefore you shouldn\u2019t be wasting your money on something you don\u2019t really want."},{"author":"","text":"And if in doubt at all, don\u2019t go to the shops. Just say, \u201cI\u2019m going to opt out altogether.\u201d And that might be the way forward\u2014because it can be really, really difficult to be sensible when you\u2019re there. Because, like I said, you will get swept into everybody\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s a bit of a frenzy; you\u2019re kind of almost feeding off each other. And therefore it might just be best not to do it at all."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, and you\u2019ve mentioned, you know, the, the FOMO that might drive someone to buy something. What do we know about how people end up feeling about their purchases after, you know, a big blowout like Black Friday? Are people generally happy that they spend that money and bought those things, or do we see a lot of regret?"},{"author":"Jansson-Boyd","text":"We do see a lot of regret \u2019cause I think often people actually assume if you buy it, you will be quite pleased with it because you\u2019re making the right decision. But it just shows how, how shaky we are, as human, about making decisions and how we actually are really, purely driven by marketing rather than by, \u201cI really want this,\u201d because otherwise you wouldn\u2019t regret it afterwards. Often it\u2019s harder to return things that\u2019s been bought during a sales period."},{"author":"","text":"What is interesting is that when you buy something, people tend to experience more regret than if they haven\u2019t bought something. And again there\u2019s several studies on this. So the fact is, if you say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not sure about buying this, but I won\u2019t do it; I just feel like I should be saving my money for something better,\u201d you are very unlikely, in fact, to regret that decision. But if you do buy something that you weren\u2019t sure about, you are very likely to feel like you wasted your money. And that is really not a good thing because not only will you kind of have regret with you buying something, wasting your money, you will also have the regret with the item itself. And sometimes, if you keep engaging in that, you can get a really quite negative self-perception \u2019cause you feel like you keep making the wrong decisions. So you should actually be very careful because it could also have potential long-term consequences."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Well, thank you so much for joining us today.

They have to send more messages saying, you know: \u201cPre-promotions.\u201d \u201cThis is only happening for 24 hours.\u201d \u201cWe are letting you know first so you can get in there before everybody else,\u201d if it\u2019s online, for an example.

And making a list, even putting a price next to it, compare three months prior to Black Friday or Cyber Monday and see, actually, what are the prices now? Because, of course, something that is quite commonly used is that prices go up just before to come back down again, which means that, yes, it is lower, they can advertise this as 50 percent off, but it wasn\u2019t actually that much higher to start off with ..."]},{"begin":"602.720","end":"603.040","lines":["Right."]},{"begin":"603.040","end":"616.000","lines":["So by monitoring that, as well as thinking about, \u201cDo I need this?

But if you do buy something that you weren\u2019t sure about, you are very likely to feel like you wasted your money. And that is really not a good thing because not only will you kind of have regret with you buying something, wasting your money, you will also have the regret with the item itself. And sometimes, if you keep engaging in that, you can get a really quite negative self-perception \u2019cause you feel like you keep making the wrong decisions.
