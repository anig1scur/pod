      "text": ": Antarctica is the largest, coldest desert on the planet, with snowfall dropping less than six inches of water there each year. But for such a dry place, Antarctica has an outsize impact on the world\u2019s oceans: the ice sheet that covers much of the continent contains most of Earth\u2019s fresh water. You\u2019ve probably heard that a lot of that ice is melting because of climate change and contributing to sea-level rise. But glaciers and ice shelves aren\u2019t just made of frozen water. What else is the melt sending out to sea? For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. You\u2019re listening to the first episode of a four-part Fascination series on Antarctica. For the next four Fridays, we\u2019ll follow award-winning Brazilian journalist Sofia Moutinho as she travels on the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a U.S. icebreaker on a mission to help us understand how the climate crisis will unfold. Today we\u2019ll meet her on the ship as she and her fellow passengers encounter the fastest-melting glaciers and ice shelves on the continent. [CLIP: Sound of waves]"

      "text": ": In West Antarctica, warmer seas are largely driving the ice melt. [CLIP: \u201cWe Are Giants,\u201d by Silver Maple] Climate change has altered wind patterns, which, in turn, impact a layer of warm water that sits relatively deep in the sea. While this water is generally just out of reach of the continental shelf, intensified winds are bringing it upward. As a result the water is spilling over the continental shelf and more readily reaching the West Antarctic ice. It moves under the ice shelves, the parts of the glaciers that extend out and bob in the sea, like floating harbors made of ice. Scientists think the warm water is silently eating up the ice from underneath, lapping it away bit by bit. Rob Sherrell is an oceanographer at Rutgers University and another of the cruise\u2019s leaders. He says he has seen the warm water\u2019s impact firsthand. When he visited this ice shelf in 2011, it looked pretty much straight all the way across. But he returned a decade later to a new view."

But unlike most people studying this area, the researchers on this cruise are not looking at sea-level rise. This is a cruise full of chemists; they are armed with huge water-collecting instruments and fancy machines to filter water. They want to find out how glacial melting is changing the chemistry of the ocean\u2014and that\u2019s important because a change in ocean chemistry here could affect everything from the food web to the global climate."

      "author": "Moutinho",
      "text": ": When glaciers melt they don\u2019t only release water into the sea; they dump different chemical elements that have been trapped in the ice for decades or even centuries. And while glaciers do move and undergo some melt naturally, climate change is intensifying that process. As they move they erode and scour the bedrock underneath, producing fine particles of rock that are carried away by meltwater."

[CLIP: \u201cHandwriting,\u201d by Frank Jonsson] One of the elements the researchers are especially interested in is iron. Iron is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. It arrives naturally in Antarctica in windblown dust and is present in the bedrock underneath glaciers. But paradoxically, it\u2019s only found in incredibly small amounts in the ocean\u2014particularly at the surface."

They serve as food for one of Antarctica\u2019s most important species: Antarctic krill, a crustacean that looks like a shrimp. In turn, krill feed all sorts of animals, from fish and penguins to seals and whales. Scientists believe hundreds of trillions of krill live in the ocean surrounding Antarctica. Some researchers estimate that a crabeater seal feasts on 11,000 krill a day, while a single Ad\u00e9lie penguin can gobble up 1,000 of these creatures on a daily basis. [CLIP: Penguin noises]"

And the Amundsen Sea is one of those special places. The phytoplankton blooms here are so intense that satellites can see them from space. Researchers on the Palmer are investigating what is happening to the ocean as glacial meltwater enriches the Amundsen Sea with iron. [CLIP: Waves hit a ship hull]"

[CLIP: \u201cNone of My Business,\u201d by Arthur Benson] Remember when I said this expedition will also help us better understand climate change? It turns out that those rotten-lettuce-smelling algal blooms are not only important for the food web but also fundamental for global climate regulation. Phytoplankton rely on photosynthesis to produce energy. Through this process they absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the carbon is incorporated into their cells.

Some researchers believe this iron made phytoplankton grow so much that it brought the carbon in the atmosphere down, contributing to global cooling. But it\u2019s not time to get your coats yet!
