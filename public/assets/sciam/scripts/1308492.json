I\u2019m here today with our friend Allison Parshall, an associate news editor at Scientific American who often covers biology, health, technology and physics. She recently covered a study all about the words humans use to express pain\u2014and the wild similarities between those exclamations."},{"author":"","text":"Allison, thanks for coming on to chat. Hopefully it won\u2019t be too painful."},{"author":"Allison Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Ouch. That\u2019s all I have to say."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So why are linguists talking about pain?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Well, linguists are talking about everything always."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Talking about talking."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But linguists are talking about pain because the words that we use to express it might actually tell us something about our shared biology and the evolution of kind of language in general. It\u2019s a pretty big topic; it\u2019s part of why I\u2019m so interested to talk about it today. But this particular discovery actually started out pretty small, with a French language researcher named Ma\u00efa Ponsonnet and what she calls a pretty, quote, \u201cnaive observation.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"She was\u2014does a lot of research on language and emotion, and she was in Australia studying Aboriginal languages when she noticed that the words many of those languages used to exclaim their pain, like \u201couch\u201d in English, sound similar to exclamations of pain in her native French. So that word in many Aboriginal languages sounds something like yakayi, and in French it\u2019s a\u00efe, and in English it\u2019s \u201cow,\u201d and\u2014do you know any in any languages?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I used to study Mandarin, and I remember that there\u2019s an ai in there: ai\u2014 ai-yo. And I\u2019m terrible with my tones, so don\u2019t [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I think it\u2019s first tone for both."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s first tone for both, which I, I remember because it feels so appropriate for an exclamation of pain [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"You\u2019re, like, high-pitched yelling, basically."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, exactly. I have studied and failed to master many languages [laughs] in my life, including Italian and Spanish, and I think in both \u201cai\u201d is just a very common exclamation of pain."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of \u201cai.\u201d Basically wherever you look around the world you\u2019ll get a lot of \u201cai,\u201d you\u2019ll get a lot of \u201cow,\u201d you\u2019ll get a lot of \u201cah.\u201d In Japanese it\u2019s itai; I don\u2019t actually speak Japanese at all, so hopefully that\u2019s not totally wrong. But\u2014so you might be seeing a pattern here, and basically Ma\u00efa Ponsonnet, when she was doing her research, noticed this pattern, she made this observation, but, like, two languages, what can you really conclude from that? Nothing."},{"author":"","text":"So they decided to do a much broader-scale study. There\u2019s not a lot of research looking into this type of word\u2014it\u2019s called an interjection: so, like, \u201couch\u201d or \u201cwow\u201d or \u201cyay.\u201d And basically they surveyed 131 languages from dozens of language families around the world. They gathered these exclamation words for pain, as well as for joy and disgust: so, like, \u201couch,\u201d \u201cyay\u201d and \u201cyuck,\u201d respectively."},{"author":"","text":"And then they found that when it comes to pain, her observation was not a superficial similarity at all. These pain interjections\u2014but not joy and disgust interjections; we\u2019ll get to that\u2014are more similar to each other across languages than they are to other words in their language that aren\u2019t pain interjections. So \u201couch\u201d and \u201cai\u201d are more similar to each other than \u201couch\u201d is to other words in English and \u201cai\u201d is to other words in\u2014pick a language that \u201cai\u201d is in."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Italian, Spanish [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Italian. Yeah, Spanish. So basically it showed that it seems likely that this isn\u2019t a coincidence and that there\u2019s some sort of hidden factor that we humans all have in common that has shaped these words similarly."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, that\u2019s really cool, and I also love that it started with, you know, what the researcher calls a \u201cnaive observation\u201d because it is the kind of thing that was right in front of us all along, and you have to wonder how many people were like, \u201cThat\u2019s a silly comparison I just made. There\u2019s obviously no real connection there.\u201d So really cool that she explored it."},{"author":"","text":"So when we say that these are similar sounds, you\u2019ve talked about this a little bit, but exactly what sounds are we discussing?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"We\u2019re basically talking about this \u201cah\u201d sound [written as [a] in the International Phonetic Alphabet]. In \u201cai\u201d and in \u201cow\u201d you can hear that both of those start the same; they both start with [a]. They\u2019re what we call diphthongs, so it basically is two vowels right next to each other. So either you could have [a], or you could have \u201cah-ee,\u201d or you could have \u201cah-oh.\u201d And so in English \u201couch\u201d kind of has that [a] sound. Even though we spell it with an o and we think of [a] typically being an a, but phonetically they\u2019re very related."},{"author":"","text":"So it\u2019s possible that [a] is also just a really common sound in language and maybe that was why it was popping up in these pain interjections. But the researchers compared these pain interjections to other words of the same length in each language and found that, no, these [a] sounds actually are just more common in pain interjections than they are in other words across the board, basically."},{"author":"","text":"So I guess my question is, like, if you were the scientist and you\u2019d seen that data\u2014you\u2019re seeing these [a] sounds popping up all over in pain interjections\u2014do you have any ideas of what you might think up as a hypothesis to explain it?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, that is a great question. I feel like I would be tempted to hypothesize that there\u2019s something innate about the experience of pain that relates to these sounds, like maybe something about our physiological reaction to pain. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a linguist, so [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Well, if I went over and pinched you, what sound might you make\u2014just, like, involuntarily?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Probably, like, \u201cah!\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah: ah, ah! So the researchers basically had the same idea. They thought, like, \u201cWell, maybe these noises that we make involuntarily, just kind of these primal sounds, maybe for pain it does kind of sound more like an [a] sound across the board.\u201d"},{"author":"","text":"Of course we don\u2019t even necessarily know that that\u2019s true. These, like, more primal vocalizations that aren\u2019t language but still communicate something are not super widely studied. So what the researchers did is gathered samples of these nonword vocalizations from five languages and cultures around the world for pain, joy and disgust\u2014so I guess you could imagine [a] for pain, \u201cee\u201d [written as [i] in the International Phonetic Alphabet] and \u201cuh\u201d [written as [\u0259] in the International Phonetic Alphabet] for disgust would maybe be what I would do if I was prompted."},{"author":"","text":"And they found that for disgust the most common vowel sounds in these\u2014so kind of like I just said: [\u0259]\u2014that ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"You can hear it. For joy it was [i], so kind of like what I just said. And for pain it was that familiar [a] sound. So this held true across five different cultures and language groups\u2014which does seem to support their hypothesis. It suggests that it\u2019s possible that these [a]-based pain words from across the world are in some way similar because of a common origin in these, like, more primal noises that we make."},{"author":"","text":"The study can\u2019t really prove that; it\u2019s a very difficult thing to prove. But it suggests that we might say \u201couch\u201d or a\u00efe or yakayi because at one point all of our ancestors were just screaming \u201cahh!\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So you mentioned joy and disgust. Are we seeing these kind of phonetic similarities in the linguistic expression of other emotions?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Not in the linguistic expression necessarily. So interestingly the study of vocalizations found, for joy and disgust across those five different languages, you had similarities, like joy was [i] and disgust was [\u0259], but that did not translate to, like, the linguistic words that we use."},{"author":"","text":"So basically, like, if disgust vocalizations were [\u0259], in English, for a disgust interjection, in the linguistic world, you might say \u201cyuck\u201d ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, or \u201cew.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Exactly. And, like, you can see, there\u2019s more cultural layers being added here. There\u2019s a bunch of things you could say to convey your disgust in terms of interjections. And the theory that the researchers had for why joy and disgust don\u2019t seem to have this similarity in the words we use to describe them: so as those layers differ between cultures, the words we use to express them are going to evolve to sound very different, even if they all kind of did start from the same place as that primal sound of [\u0259]."},{"author":"","text":"But pain is a feeling; it\u2019s not really an emotion. Like, I feel like it\u2019s kind of misclassified to say pain is an emotion. It\u2019s, like, more of a physiological response. You could argue that disgust is, too. For sure, there\u2019s some sort of, like, physiological thing we have like the gag reflex. But pain is subjective and complicated, and it does differ across cultures, but our bodies do have, like, literal pain receptors that either fire or they don\u2019t. So it\u2019s possible that might be why it\u2019s the only response they saw here that has similar vocalizations and interjections across languages."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what can that tell us about language?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It\u2019s all very hypothetical, but it\u2019s all so interesting to me, and that\u2019s what really gets me about this, is the idea that there are these more, like, primal, mysterious, unseen forces that are shaping the words that we humans develop to describe the world, regardless of where you\u2019re from on the planet, this is pretty new because for a long time there was this really dominant idea in the field of linguistics that language is fundamentally arbitrary."},{"author":"","text":"So what I mean by arbitrary is that, like, the sounds kind of don\u2019t matter; we just kind of tie them to meaning and make them have meaning but that the sounds themselves don\u2019t have any meaning. Like, when I say \u201cbird\u201d to you and you think of a bird that\u2019s just because you\u2019ve learned to associate [the sound of the word \u201cbird\u201d] with a bird but not because there\u2019s anything birdlike about those sounds I just made."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"In fact, one of my [laughs], my cousin-in-law\u2019s baby, who is German and learning English as a second language, uses the word \u201cbird\u201d to talk about any animal that excites her and, by extension, really anything that excites her [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Really anything. I feel like that, that\u2019s quite common with kids, too."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And so the, the idea was that the sounds themselves are arbitrary, but we know that that\u2019s not right because language is full of nonarbitrariness. Like, for example, there\u2019s onomatopoeia. Can you think of any of your favorite onomatopoeia, which are words ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"\u201cSplat.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"\u201cSplat.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, that\u2019s a great one. \u201cCrunch.\u201d \u201cCrackle.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Mm, those are good ones. I like \u201cboom.\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, \u201cboom\u201d is great."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"\u201cSwish\u201d is fun because it really invokes the ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, \u201cshoo,\u201d you know?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah\u2014\u201chiss.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But so these are words that basically reflect how\u2014we\u2019re basically trying to use a word to just\u2014to replicate a sound."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And that can do some interesting things, like putting a b in front of things that we think of as more, like, explosive, like \u201cboom\u201d or \u201cblast\u201d or \u201cbang.\u201d I mean, there is something, \u201cbuh\u201d [written as [b] in the International Phonetic Alphabet], that is ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Literally a plosive consonant is what linguists call it; there\u2019s air exploding from your mouth."},{"author":"","text":"So there\u2019s all of these really subtle associations we can make. And I did want to ask: Have you heard of the \u201cbouba-kiki\u201d effect?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I have\u2014you know I have [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Can you recount the bouba-kiki effect for me?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yes, the bouba-kiki effect is the fact that\u2014at least among English speakers and I think some other languages, too\u2014people associate \u201cbouba,\u201d but also, like, b sounds in general, with sort of soft, rounded squishy things and \u201ckiki\u201d and similar sounds to spiky shapes, and there\u2019s, like, the \u201cbouba\u201d and the \u201ckiki\u201d shape that are used in this study, but it\u2019s also sort of more broadly: it\u2019s, like, there are spiky words, and then [laughs] there are squishy words."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I mean, I, I love your response, too, because I get to say, like, it\u2019s definitely not just English. The cool thing about it is that it\u2019s basically, like, languages and cultures all around the world. It\u2019s been replicated pretty well."},{"author":"","text":"If you give someone two shapes, one is bulbous and one is spiky, and you ask which one is \u201cbouba\u201d and \u201ckiki,\u201d they will tend to put \u201cbouba\u201d with the rounded one and \u201ckiki\u201d with the spiky one. But I did just kind of, like, tip my hand there a second because I called them bulbous and spiky ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Which you can hear\u2014bulba, \u201cbouba\u201d; spiky, \u201ckiki\u201d\u2014like, you can hear it in there."},{"author":"","text":"And this finding has been replicated a lot, and there\u2019s other ones, too. So really recently researchers found an even stronger association: that the trilled r sound, so the [r] sound [as it\u2019s written in the International Phonetic Alphabet], is associated with roughness and the \u201cluh\u201d sound [written as [l] in the International Phonetic Alphabet], or what we would say as \u201cL\u201d in English, is associated with smoothness."},{"author":"","text":"And that\u2019s across the world; that\u2019s even in languages that don\u2019t use these phonemes in their language or that group r and l sounds together as the same phoneme, like Japanese. And I just think that\u2019s so cool, especially because, of course, we\u2019re going to hear the sound [r] and think instinctively to make a metaphor to texture, right? Like, it sounds rough and ragged and ridged\u2014I\u2019m not even really cherry-picking here. Like, I tried to look up synonyms for \u201crough\u201d ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That started with l, for example, and I couldn\u2019t find any. This is all cherry-picked, but, like, still."},{"author":"","text":"But l, you can think of, like, lilting, flowing, gliding, silky. There\u2019s all of these ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"We, we have these associations, even if they\u2019re kind of flying under our radar perceptually, and that\u2019s what the linguists are all trying to find. And I think they\u2019re so cool; it just\u2014there\u2019s so many of these little associations we don\u2019t even know to make."},{"author":"","text":"For example, like, even within specific languages there\u2019s things called phonesthemes\u2014I hope I\u2019m pronouncing that right. These don\u2019t generalize across languages generally, but, like, in English, for example, the word\u2014the phonestheme \u201cgl-\u201d is often associated with light, so, like, a glow or glimmer. And I just think that\u2019s so interesting. We don\u2019t tend to notice these, but by doing a really\u2014look and\u2014across one language or across all languages, as many languages as you can pull together, you can kind of start to see these patterns that go under the radar, and it raises the questions of why it\u2019s like that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, totally. Well, speaking of questions, what are the next big ones to answer here?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I mean, the big question is basically, like, what else is out there? The researchers, to follow up on this study specifically, they are curious if maybe they would see different results if they looked at consonants and not just vowels."},{"author":"","text":"So in some languages, words that evoke or respond to disgust use this consonant that we don\u2019t tend to have a lot in English but that goes like \u201cchuh\u201d\u2014I hope I\u2019m pronouncing that right; it\u2019s represented by an [x] in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Or maybe there\u2019s, like, plosive consonants like b or p\u2014like \u201cbuh,\u201d \u201cpuh,\u201d \u201ctuh\u201d [written as [b], [p], [t], respectively, in the International Phonetic Alphabet]\u2014maybe those are more common in disgust. I\u2019m just throwing things out there; there\u2019s no necessary reason to think that it\u2019s like that. But, like, what are the other hidden similarities in the ways that we talk?"},{"author":"","text":"And Ponsonnet and her colleagues are actually using AI now to try to uncover more of those similarities, which is kind of the thing that AI was always really good at, right? Just ingesting a ton of data and telling researchers where there might be a signal and connections that, like, our human eyes can miss. So I definitely am excited to stay tuned and have my mind blown by future little hidden symbolisms."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, absolutely."},{"author":"","text":"I saw that you recently put together a roundup of, like, this and a few other studies on language from 2024. Are there any other favorites you wanna share from those highlights?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"This is kind of similar to this finding\u2014at least, I was thinking about this a lot when writing the story\u2014but we had an article about this study that aims to understand why some words in a language survive and other ones go extinct. Kind of, like, what are the rules for survival of the fittest for language? Because we know that our vocabularies expand and contract, and, like, some words go out of existence and some new ones get born."},{"author":"","text":"So in this study the researchers basically had people play this big game of \u201ctelephone.\u201d They had a story that they were told\u2014the participants were told\u2014and then the participants had to remember and rewrite that story for other participants. And they found that more concrete words lasted longer than more abstract ones; more emotionally exciting words, whether they were positive or negative, lasted longer; and also words that were acquired at a younger age."},{"author":"","text":"So this paring down doesn\u2019t necessarily reduce language to baby talk over time, but you could think of it as, like, making language more efficient, which I thought was a kind of interesting dynamic. And then, of course, we pull in new, complicated words as we go to suit our needs."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, \u201cbrain rot.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"\u201cBrain rot,\u201d exactly [laughs], which I hope\u2014I don\u2019t hope is dead; I just think that now, once Oxford English Dictionary gets ahold of it, it should be [laughs] ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I think we might be done saying it."},{"author":"","text":"And this one isn\u2019t really linguistics, but researchers have come a really long way in brain-computer interfaces, which\u2014it might be a little overly simplistic to call them mind-reading devices, but they\u2019re basically mind-reading devices ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right, they\u2019re literally mind reading, not necessarily what people think of when they say \u201cmind reading\u201d [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, they\u2019re not\u2014but, like, they\u2019re able to look at the brain with\u2014like, take measurements from the brain using electrodes and then translate that into coherent speech. And this has been a slow process of it getting slowly better and better and better, but it seems like this year we hit a really important milestone, which is: there was a man with ALS who was part of a clinical trial, and he regained the ability to talk to his family. Researchers now say that the technology is at the level of quality where it can actually be useful to patients ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, it\u2019s correct enough of the time that it\u2019s the kind of thing people can really start using ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Which is pretty incredible."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And then also, one of the more fascinating brain language stories I got to read this past year was from SciAm\u2019s very own copy editor Emily Makowski, and she wrote about her experience with something called ticker-tape synesthesia, which I had never heard of but is fascinating. Basically whenever she hears or thinks words, she basically gets, like, mental subtitles ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That kind of scroll in front of her eyes, and it\u2019s not something she can turn off. It\u2019s, at times, I think she describes it as at times helpful, at times annoying, and I\u2014her story of how she came to discover that that was the case for her fairly recently, I thought, was very funny and interesting. So I would really recommend reading her story about it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow, yeah, I somehow missed that one, so I will definitely have to check it out. And it seems like there were a lot of cool linguistics findings in 2024, and this \u201couch\u201d study is right up there, so thanks so much for coming to talk to us."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.
