Today: Episode Three of our four-part Fascination on really big birds. We\u2019re going on a gargantuan goose chase."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"I love talking about these big birds because, as you see, most people, you know, think ostrich, and they think that\u2019s big. But actually they were real giants around at one time."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"This is paleontologist Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan of the University of Cape Town in South Africa. She\u2019s talking about the dromornithids. That\u2019s their scientific name. But in big bird circles, you\u2019ll hear them called thunderbirds."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"And I think the name the thunderbirds is really quite wonderful because it kind of immediately\u2014you know, you can understand these really large animals are coming."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"Thunderbirds lived in Australia, and they had a long run. The earliest members of the group date back 50 million years or so, and one species persisted to about 40,000 years ago. And there was one thunderbird that was more thunderous than the rest."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"The largest are the thunderbirds called Dromornis stirtoni. And they are known from the late Miocene, about eight million years ago. [Music]"},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"Here\u2019s what to picture."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"It\u2019s like an overgrown ostrich, you know. Think about an ostrich, just kind of bigger\u2014big beaks; the bones would have been heavier, more bulkier, more robust ..."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape)","text":"But, like, a lot bulkier and more robust."},{"author":"Trevor Worthy: ","text":"Absolutely. They are some of the hugest birds on the planet\u2014were on the planet."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"This is paleontologist and thunderbird expert Trevor Worthy."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"They got up to a whopping great 1,300 pounds, which is quite a lot, ten times a human."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape)","text":"A bird the size of a cow."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"They were huge in \u2026 almost every way."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"They\u2019ve got no discernible wings. The bit that pokes out of the side of the body is four inches. It isn\u2019t going to make a dent in the feathers."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"They\u2019re not flying. Their closest living relatives are ducks and geese. And that\u2019s another thing you could picture: just a gigantic goose trundling across a lush landscape\u2014Australia was greener eight million years ago\u2014grazing on plants and fruits. \u00a0Trevor says the thunderbirds\u2019 vegetarian diet might partly explain their size."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"You can get big; you can have a big gut. And then you can eat a lot of rubbish. So if you can ingest a lot of low-quality food, then that is one way of living in an environment."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"Their big body probably helped them in other ways, too. Here\u2019s Anusuya again."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"Their body size probably evolves in the context of what else is around at the time. In Australia, there were these thylacines. There are these marsupial lions, and I think a big body size would have enabled them to escape predation."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape): ","text":"They\u2019re just too big to eat."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"Yeah. Or otherwise it\u2019s too much of trouble to deal with them. You know, you rather go after something that\u2019s smaller, that\u2019s not going to harm you. Because, I think, you know, we know ostriches certainly are not predators, but an ostrich can do pretty serious damage to, to any animal that attacks it just by kicking."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape): ","text":"And if they\u2019re related to geese, I mean, we all know how terrifying geese can be."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"Yes. You know, I had a friend earlier this year that was attacked by a goose, and you\u2019re not going to believe this, but literally, she had to be hospitalized because this goose attacked out of nowhere."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape)","text":"Just imagine if that goose was, you know, 1,300 pounds."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"Exactly. Exactly."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"But how did they grow so big? That\u2019s something Anusuya wanted to understand. To drill down on that question, she took a very thin section of a thunderbird bone and looked at it under the microscope."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"And this is fascinating because it tells us about the way in which the bone was deposited. So it tells us about the rates of growth."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"Bones have rings that correspond to growth. Like tree rings\u2026"},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"Where you have a white band that is growth during the favorable season, and then you have a growth line that indicates growth stopped for a period of time, and then afterward, it resumes. So just like tree rings, you can count the number of rings, and you can work out the age of the animal, and you can work out how long it took for an animal to grow to an adult body size."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"This bone ring method is a feather in Anusuya\u2019s cap\u2014she developed it when she was just a fledgling Ph.D. student working on dinosaurs. And when she applied the method to this giant thunderbird, she found ..."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"These birds lived life in the slow lane. We can find growth cycles in the bones that suggest that they took about 15 years to reach an adult body size. And this is really a long time, compared to modern birds that grow up very quickly."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"And it took them years to have babies, too, the data suggest. Anusuya and Trevor say that gives us some insight, into why these birds don\u2019t exist today. [Music] If life is easy\u2014if there is enough food and not a lot of pressure from predators\u2014you can take your time to grow up and have babies. But this can be a riskier strategy when life is tough. And life did get tough for thunderbirds. After eight million years ago, Australia became more arid. And that\u2019s when the giant D. stirtoni disappears."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"Humans arrived in Australia around 50,000 years ago, and soon after, you don\u2019t find any species of thunderbirds at all."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"Having the strategy of life in the slow lane didn\u2019t facilitate being able to deal with something new in the environment, which is taking out numbers of their young."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"This theory is backed up by another bird tale. Consider the emu, a different big bird that lived alongside the thunderbirds."},{"author":"Worthy","text":"An emu, in contrast, it will grow to full body size in 14 months and is breeding shortly after that."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"And while the thunderbirds went extinct, the emu survived."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan: ","text":"It survives because its growth rate is so much faster, so it is able to reach an adult size very quickly, it reproduce very quickly, and it\u2019s able to recoup its numbers very quickly."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"And that\u2019s something to think about. Because many of the birds at our feeders, flapping around our cities, pooping on our cars\u2014they live life in the fast lane. They grow up quickly and have babies early. And in an uncertain world, filled with two-legged jerks who make life hard for other animals, this strategy has advantages."},{"author":"Chinsamy-Turan","text":"So I think that when you see a pigeon or a robin, one should appreciate that they are the end products of a long evolutionary history, that there were many other forms that came before them. And I think the giant birds, they also are part of this evolutionary history of all modern birds that we see today."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"On the next Science, Quickly: when a big bird becomes an axe murderer."},{"author":"Federico Degrange","text":"Terror birds do not follow the general rules of, of birds. They use the beak as an axe to kill prey."},{"author":"Lichtman (tape)","text":"That\u2019s terrifying."},{"author":"Degrange","text":"Well, that\u2019s why they are terror birds."},{"author":"Lichtman","text":"You\u2019ve just listened to Part Three in a four-part Science, Quickly Fascination on really big birds.
