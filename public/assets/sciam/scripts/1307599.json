Thousands of athletes from more than 200 territories will float on boats down the Seine. City officials and event organizers have placed a big bet on this beloved river: that the infamously polluted waters will be safe for Olympic swimmers to compete in. But their efforts have been met with\u2014well, we\u2019ll say skepticism, to say the least. Back in June, when the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, was set to swim in the Seine to show her confidence in the cleanup efforts, a trending hashtag encouraged folks to poop in the river in\u2014protest? Unclear. Hidalgo did successfully take a dip this past Wednesday and gave the experience rave reviews. [CLIP: Cheering and clapping]"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"But that doesn\u2019t mean the Olympic events will go quite as swimmingly. You know what they say about stepping into the same river twice: those things are always changing and always flowing. And the Seine\u2019s bacterial levels are still fluctuating from day to day. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Today I\u2019m joined by associate news editor Allison Parshall, who investigated this high-profile cleanup attempt for us. So, Allison tell me: Are Olympians going to swim in the river or not?"},{"author":"Allison Parshall","text":"I would love to be able to tell you\u2014I would peer into my crystal ball\u2014but I think until there are bodies in the water, I\u2019m not going to be able to say one way or the other [laughs]. And that\u2019s mostly because they\u2019ve basically done all that they can at this point from the perspective of, you know, cleaning up the river. The main problem right now is bacteria, and some of the things that could cause bacteria levels to be higher are kind of just at the whims of the weather: It\u2019s if it\u2019s too rainy, bacteria counts can be too high. If it\u2019s not sunny enough, because sun can kill the bacteria\u2014the bacteria counts can be too high. So throughout June, basically, the bacteria counts were much higher than, I think, anyone expected or wanted. And that\u2019s because the\u2014Western Europe, in general, had an unseasonably wet summer, at least in the beginning. So basically, after a very wet June, the organizers, who had been very proudly saying, \u201cThere is no backup plan. We\u2019re all in on this end. There is no backup plan. There\u2019s no plan B,\u201d announced a backup plan. So the backup plan for the marathon swimming events, at least, which is one of the ones that would be in the Seine, is this nautical stadium outside of the city. It\u2019s this very fancy facility inaugurated in 2019. It\u2019s already hosting the Olympic and Paralympic canoe, kayak and rowing events, so there\u2019s that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, well, it\u2019s good that they have that backup. From above, this facility definitely looks like that kind of freaky ocean arena from The Hunger Games, but ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Hate it."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely, though. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lovely place to be and definitely better than a river full of poop, in any case."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"It\u2019s probably hard not to be better than a river full of poop."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But basically this nautical stadium, it\u2019s already hosting those boating events, but the triathlon wouldn\u2019t be able to be relocated there\u2014so that\u2019s the other event that would be swimming in the Seine. So that they would just have to postpone that and hope the bacteria levels go down. Or if they don\u2019t, it could just get downgraded from a triathlon to a duathlon, which I feel like is a different sport."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I think if I had trained for years to specifically be in the triathlon in the Olympics, and swimming got cut, and that was, like, my main strength, I\u2019d be pretty ticked off. It makes you wonder why Paris, like, took such a chance on the Seine in the first place."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"This river is such an important part of their city\u2019s history and culture, and they\u2019ve been trying to clean it for a long time, and so it might be one of the only cities right now where we\u2019re seeing them place such a big bet in the international spotlight on being able to clean this up, especially when it\u2019s kind of at the whims of the weather. But they\u2019re definitely not the only city facing this problem with its urban waterways. Industrialized cities across the world are reaching this kind of new phase of their river cleanup, at least for these rivers that were once so polluted by industry. And it\u2019s possible that after, you know, decades, centuries of being very unsightly waste dumps, we might get to swim in a lot of urban waterways again. So I\u2019ve got kind of, like, a personal touchstone with this. I grew up in Ohio. My Seine, as I like to say, was the Cuyahoga River ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, wow."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Have you heard of the Cuyahoga River?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I have in the context of it being, like, a river so gross that it inspired us to create the Environmental Protection Agency [laughs], which is ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Yeah, when I was a kid ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Such a legacy."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"When I was a kid it was just, like, the place that we would go as a family on the weekends. We would walk and bike the towpath, and then there was this farmers\u2019 market where we would get ice cream and corn on the cob; it was very Ohio. But I didn\u2019t realize until I grew up that most of the people like you that knew of the Cuyahoga knew of it because they\u2019d seen pictures of it on fire\u2014like, the surface of the river burning, or at least ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"The industrial waste ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"It\u2019s striking [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, yeah\u2014that picture in particular. There\u2019s this one particular photo, and it shows these firefighters spewing water onto the surface of the river to, you know, try to put out the fire, and it looks so preposterous because a river\u2019s not supposed to be on fire. So when I picture these urban waterways that have just been so polluted but have since been relatively cleaned up, I picture this infamous image of the Cuyahoga on fire and then what I know it as today, which is kind of a muddy, lazy river but definitely not on fire. And I actually talked to a hydrologist about this\u2014her name\u2019s Anne Jefferson. She researches urban waterways at the University of Vermont, but she spent 10 years of her career at Kent State University, studying the nearby Cuyahoga."},{"author":"Anne Jefferson","text":"The Cuyahoga River didn\u2019t just catch fire once; it caught fire [a] dozen-plus times. It was oil. It was paint byproducts. It was all sorts of industrial byproducts. It\u2014also sewage\u2014the sewage is not the part that\u2019s gonna catch fire, but it\u2019s, you know, if you fell into the Cuyahoga, or if you fell into the Thames in London, the advice was that you take yourself to the hospital immediately."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I can\u2019t say that I really want to swim in the Cuyahoga River, even these days\u2014like, it generally looks pretty muddy\u2014but it\u2019s no longer a flaming health hazard, so there\u2019s that. And its misfortunes really helped galvanize support for new regulation: that\u2019s the Clean Water Act of \u201972. Paris\u2019s river may not have caught fire, but it kind of has a similar story, as do many other urban rivers. After the industrial revolution they just become this dumping ground that carries all of our waste, both of our bodies and of our factories, out and away from cities. And in Paris, this killed what was a really important part of the city\u2019s culture at the time, which is bathing in the Seine."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s so wild. Like, I, I can know intellectually that before cities were super polluted, their rivers were nice places to be, but I still have trouble picturing people, like, you know, bathing in the Seine."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I don\u2019t know that this was all\u2014the case with every industrialized city, but it was definitely the case with Paris. I mean, a lot of cities, you know, they kind of grew up around the industrial revolution. But with Paris there are several very famous paintings by Monet, Renoir, Seurat that depict these riverside scenes, and there\u2019s these famous floating bathhouses that were filled with untreated water from the city\u2014like, basically barges. And swimming in the river was largely banned in 1867. But that was just in the city, and then in the suburbs it was banned in 1923, but some people kept swimming in it. Like, Paris did hold the 1900 Olympics swimming events in the Seine. So this would be\u2014if they do swim, it\u2019ll be upholding this 124-year-old tradition. But by the 1960s the river was just well and truly disgusting, and it had been declared biologically dead."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"I mean, first of all, continuing to swim in it\u2014extremely French. Second of all, what does it, what does it actually mean for a river to be biologically dead?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, I asked Anne Jefferson that question because I also had never found a definition. She has never found a definition, so it might be kind of, like, an advocacy phrase."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"A vibe."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"People say it a lot\u2014a vibe. It\u2014basically it means, roughly, there\u2019s no fish, or there\u2019s no \u201cdesirable species,\u201d quote, unquote ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Fair enough."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"But the bacteria, as undesirable as they may be\u2014or some of them, at least\u2014those were thriving, definitely, in the 1960s. And later\u2014in \u201985, I think, was the low point\u2014it was measured\u2014the Seine was measured to have 500,000 colony-forming units of E. coli per 100 milliliters of water. That\u2019s, like, 500 times the current European standard for bathing. Yeah, we\u2019re\u2014I mean, I\u2019m picturing sludge. I imagine it would not be sludge\u2014like, it would still be water consistency\u2014but I\u2019m just picturing a lot of bacteria. But I have to say, the Cuyahoga, during a dry summer around the same time, I think in, like, \u201982, the E. coli counts ranged up to 2 million. So not that it\u2019s a competition, but I think we won\u2014or lost. And I mean, it was only a few years later\u2014so in 1988\u2014that the mayor of Paris at the time, Jacques Chirac, he promised to swim in the Seine within three years\u2019 time. Would you like to guess if he kept the promise?"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] I\u2019m gonna guess he did not do that [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"That is correct. He did not do that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That just makes me think of the Mary-Kate and Ashley movie Passport to Paris. Do you remember the scene where they\u2019re visiting their, I think, grandfather is, like, the French ambassador or something, and he\u2019s trying to get the French to accept this, like, clean water proposal, and they\u2019re like, \u201cNo! We don\u2019t need your stinky, American, clean water.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"\u201cNo!\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah. And then they surprise the, I guess, president or prime minister at a dinner party with a glass of tap water that\u2019s untreated, and it\u2019s like\u2014it looks like chocolate milk. It\u2019s, like, so disgusting. And I\u2019m sure they took a lot of liberties with crafting the, the untreated Parisian water. But it was a real\u2014I think I saw a TikTok recently that was like, \u201cThis full-on Erin Brockovich moment from Mary-Kate and Ashley.\u201d Very formative for me [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I somehow missed this movie, but I think I absolutely would have loved it. And, like, I guess to be clear, the French government is not saying that the river needs to be clean enough to drink. That would be a whole other thing entirely. But the, the river is definitely in a better shape now than it was when, you know, Jacques Chirac promised to swim in it. Last summer, actually, the part where the Olympic races are supposed to start from, of the Seine, it was swimmable seven days out of 10, on average, so it\u2019s not that bad. Like, like, people are making it sound like it\u2019s literally, like, a flaming\u2014you know, like the Cuyahoga or something. But in reality it, it\u2019s more variable than that. And the fact that it\u2019s possible at all for any, you know, somewhat safe swimming in rivers like the Seine right now is because of those regulations like the one from Mary-Kate and Ashley movie Passport to Paris or whatever. It\u2019s because of those regulations that targeted the obvious and easy places where waste was being dumped into our water\u2014so like the pipes just dumping industrial waste straight into the water. That\u2019s what Jefferson called the \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d"},{"author":"Jefferson","text":"So once you\u2019ve taken care of, like, the paint and the oil and stuff going into the river from the factories, what you\u2019re left with is this harder problem that we call nonpoint source pollution. It\u2019s the pollution that\u2019s coming from a million different little places, right? In the air it\u2019s the stuff coming out of the tailpipes of our cars. For water it\u2019s stormwater runoff: it\u2019s all the water coming off the rooftops and pavements, being carried by thousands of pipes, coming into every small stream, every river, you know, from every neighborhood."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So that stormwater that\u2019s coming from all those pipes, it\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s carrying things like fertilizer, pesticides, bacteria\u2014basically all sorts of stuff that you just don\u2019t want in the water. And even worse, in many cities like Paris\u2014also kind of, like, 60 percent of New York\u2014when it enters stormwater drains, it gets funneled into the same pipes that carry the raw sewage to our wastewater plants, and when it rains too much, you get a bit of a backup."},{"author":"Jefferson","text":"In order to keep this sewage-stormwater mix from backing up into people\u2019s houses, you have what are called combined sewer overflows, so sort of like the safety pressure release valves on the system where now water is being diverted out of the sewage network and directly into streams, rivers and lakes. And this was one of those \u201cit seemed like a good idea at the time\u201d legacies that constrain what we do now."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"And the reason it\u2019s so constraining is because it\u2019s so expensive to fix. Basically what you\u2019d have to do is dig up all of those combined pipes and replace them with two sets: one for sewage, one for stormwater. And some cities like Minneapolis have tried to do that, but probably the more common option is to just find somewhere to store all of that mixed sewer-stormwater stuff until the treatment plant is ready to take care of it, so I reached out to Bruno Pigott, the acting assistant administrator for water at the EPA, and he mentioned some ways that cities are going about doing this."},{"author":"Bruno Pigott","text":"In Indianapolis, for example, they put in a 28-mile tunnel [system] underground that captures all this combined sewage before it gets to a water body, stores it and then sends it to a wastewater treatment plant for cleanup."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So he actually told me a bit about this time that he got to visit the site of that project. He was working for the state of Indiana at the time, in, like, the 2010s. And this project is still under construction\u2014and it cost $2 billion."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Pigott","text":"I went down as they were building the tunnel and went into it\u2014so the sewage that eventually will be in that tunnel was not, luckily, there when I was in it. But it looks very much like a tunnel that you would see in a subway. I mean, it\u2019s that big. It\u2019s tremendously large. You could drive a truck down this tunnel. It is, it\u2019s so deep that it stores millions of gallons of sewage so that the treatment plants can actually treat it and send it out in a clean form back to the river."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So that\u2019s not too different from Paris\u2019 main solution ahead of the Olympic Games. They also just built this very big basin to hold all of that raw sewage-stormwater mix."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, yeah ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"\u201cThe shove it all under the bed\u201d method\u2014tried and true [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] Well, it\u2019s more like \u201cshove it under the bed, and then take a little bit out of it every day for the next few months until you can finally take care of it all\u201d ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, great ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So, yeah, yeah ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s actually really nice."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So it\u2019s not like\u2014it\u2019s not gonna sit in there forever. It\u2019s actually kind of the logical solution because the whole problem in the first place is just the system does not have enough capacity to deal with all of this water. Their backup plan is dump it in rivers, which is not all that logical\u2014it\u2019s just, like Anne Jefferson said, seemed like a good idea at the time. This is probably just as logical of a solution, besides, you know, replacing all the pipes or scaling up the wastewater treatment\u2019s capacity. But basically this basin, even though it sounds like it would be maybe the cheaper option, is still pretty expensive: they spent \u20ac90 million on it; that\u2019s about $97 million. And that reservoir holds 50,000 cubic meters of liquid, so that is 20 Olympic-size swimming pools\u2019 worth of raw sewage m\u00e9lange that might otherwise get dumped into the river for the actual Olympic swimmers."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Incredible."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So that basin was completed in May, and bacteria levels in the water, which is the main concern for the swimming events, were still measuring too high throughout June, and that\u2019s partially just because it\u2019s been so unseasonably rainy, causing a lot more of those combined sewer overflows. For what it\u2019s worth, the Olympics president said that he remains confident that the weather will be fine and the river will be fine come the end of July, so, you know, there\u2019s that. But I did get to speak with someone who actually had the opportunity to swim in the Seine. Her name is Sibylle van der Walt. She\u2019s the president of a clean water advocacy organization based in France."},{"author":"Sibylle van der Walt","text":"It does mean a little bit of courage to, to, to swim in the Seine, firstly because the water is dark. It\u2019s, it\u2019s not transparent, and that is not a good sign."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"How murky are we talking about here?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"She told me that she couldn\u2019t see much further down than about a foot [roughly 0.3 meters], so most of her body was totally obscured by the water."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Ugh, that\u2019s\u2014yeah, ew [laughs]."},{"author":"Van der Walt","text":"But it didn\u2019t smell bad, that I can say, and I didn\u2019t have a problem afterwards, so I was perhaps just lucky, and first you think, \u201cOh, what is\u2014what am I doing here?\u201d and so, but then you get used to it, and then it was actually very pleasant. It\u2019s, it\u2019s fun."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"So Van der Walt got involved in the movement for swimmable urban rivers when she moved to France after living in Germany and Switzerland, and those are two countries where swimming in rivers is far more common."},{"author":"Van der Walt","text":"I used to work at the University of Bern, where you have a river called Aare, and there even the president of the parliament goes for a swim during the lunch break, and it\u2019s really, like, everyone walks around in a swimming costume and walks up the river, jumps in and comes back."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Apparently some people in Bern actually use the river to commute one way to work during the summers ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, they, like, pack up their belongings in floating, waterproof bags and just go for a dip, and I guess just coast home."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, my gosh, I\u2014so I assumed you meant, like, boating, but, no, we\u2019re talking about people swimming ..."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"No, yeah\u2014in the water."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Briefcase bobbing along behind them\u2014incredible [laughs]."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"[Laughs] I literally did not believe this. I thought that it was one of those Internet stories, made up, and it doesn\u2019t seem like this is something that people do really often, but I did email the Swiss Lifesaving Society\u2014it\u2019s a lifeguard association\u2014to confirm because it sounded so far-fetched, and they warned me that the current in the river that goes through Bern is no joke, and they actually don\u2019t recommend swimming in it right now, but some people appear to actually do this. And this kind of river-swimming culture seems like a total dream to me, that\u2019s something totally unattainable in Paris and definitely in New York City, where we both live, and ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Like, sure, these rivers are no longer full of stinky industrial waste, and cities are turning back toward them by building waterfront parks and business districts, but swimming in them? It feels harder ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, yeah, a river doesn\u2019t have to be on fire for me to not wanna swim in it. There\u2019s, there\u2019s a spectrum, really, from \u201con fire\u201d to, to \u201cswimmable,\u201d and I don\u2019t really feel like the Hudson is there yet."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, apparently they do the triathlon in\u2014the New York City Triathlon\u2014the swimming part is in the Hudson, so, you know, I\u2019m not tempted to do that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Yeah, I think I briefly, in, like, a moment of complete delusion a few years ago, I was like, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m gonna try to get into triathlons.\u201d And I honestly don\u2019t remember if the part about the triathlon being in the Hudson River was, like, a selling point to me, or if that was the moment when I was like, \u201cWait, I\u2019ve suddenly remembered I absolutely don\u2019t want to do a triathlon under any circumstances.\u201d"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I mean, I did go to the beach for the first time since moving to New York last weekend, and I was shocked at how pleasant it was. I think I forgot how much it\u2019s enjoyable ..."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Oh, yeah."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"To swim in, like, natural waters. I mean, they\u2019re installing a pool in the East River now in New York. They call it a, quote, \u201cgiant strainer\u201d dropped into the river. So relatively soon you should be able to do that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, I remember when the renderings for that first went around, and I, like, I would totally do it, but I kind of feel like tourists and, like, wannabe influencers are gonna make it terrible even if there isn\u2019t tons of pathogenic bacteria in it. So, yeah, fingers crossed, but I, I have to say, I\u2019m not optimistic. So, yeah, I\u2019m getting the impression that, like, unless a city makes a big effort to make swimming safe, and that that\u2019s been confirmed by outside testing, like, you probably don\u2019t want to go do laps in an urban river. Would you say that\u2019s true?"},{"author":"Parshall","text":"I don\u2019t know if it totally needs a big effort in every city\u2014some of them are just not as bad. Like, Sibylle Van der Walt told me about a couple cities in France where the quality is kind of fine already. But basically, if you\u2019re looking at swimming in pretty much any urban waterway, you\u2019re gonna wanna take precautions. And that includes checking the recent bacterial accounts for the water, if that information is available\u2014a lot of cities do make it available. And just, when in doubt, do not swim after heavy rains, especially if the city has combined sewer and stormwater systems."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Sure, makes sense."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, also\u2014whether or not the Olympians are actually able to swim in the Seine, at this point, you know, it\u2019s a little bit of an act of God, but Paris\u2019 mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and other Siene cleanup proponents, they really emphasize that this project will benefit Parisians beyond the Olympics, regardless of whether or not the Olympians are able to swim. So the government of Paris has said that there will be three public swimming sites that will be open for the summer of 2025. That\u2019s next summer."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, no, that\u2019s a really good point. And, you know, so much Olympics infrastructure, like, ends up not being useful to cities, you know, kind of infamously, after the fact, but it\u2019s true that a clean, swimmable river is something that is gonna be really impactful."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of kind of schadenfreude surrounding this whole situation, I think, just because the Olympics can be so fraught: There\u2019s so much money involved. There\u2019s livelihoods involved. There\u2019s\u2014France is in the midst of a difficult political time. It makes sense that people are so\u2014have so\u2014focused in on this as kind of a, a symbol of the success of the Olympics. But putting all of that aside, it, it seems like an uncomplicated good to me to be able to say, \u201cHey, this river is swimmable now,\u201d or at least it\u2019s a lot closer to swimmable, or even if it isn\u2019t swimmable, there is, you know, 50 Olympic swimming pool worth of raw sewage that is, in the worst-case scenario \u2026"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"No longer in the river."},{"author":"Parshall","text":"Not being dumped into the river. I think, you know, if, if the Olympics has to be the excuse for them to spend \u20ac90 million on it\u2014which, again, like, in comparison, Indianapolis spent $2 billion\u2014so it, it can be, it can be a really fraught topic, but at the same time, hey, clean water\u2014seems like a good thing."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] It\u2019s true.

But their efforts have been met with\u2014well, we\u2019ll say skepticism, to say the least. Back in June, when the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, was set to swim in the Seine to show her confidence in the cleanup efforts, a trending hashtag encouraged folks to poop in the river in\u2014protest?

If it\u2019s not sunny enough, because sun can kill the bacteria\u2014the bacteria counts can be too high. So throughout June, basically, the bacteria counts were much higher than, I think, anyone expected or wanted.

There\u2019s no plan B,\u201d announced a backup plan.

And even worse, in many cities like Paris\u2014also kind of, like, 60 percent of New York\u2014when it enters stormwater drains, it gets funneled into the same pipes that carry the raw sewage to our wastewater plants, and when it rains too much, you get a bit of a backup."]},{"begin":"763.360","end":"795.240","lines":["In order to keep this sewage-stormwater mix from backing up into people\u2019s houses, you have what are called combined sewer overflows, so sort of like the safety pressure release valves on the system where now water is being diverted out of the sewage network and directly into streams, rivers and lakes.

And some cities like Minneapolis have tried to do that, but probably the more common option is to just find somewhere to store all of that mixed sewer-stormwater stuff until the treatment plant is ready to take care of it, so I reached out to Bruno Pigott, the acting assistant administrator for water at the EPA, and he mentioned some ways that cities are going about doing this."]},{"begin":"830.480","end":"849.240","lines":["In Indianapolis, for example, they put in a 28-mile tunnel [system] underground that captures all this combined sewage before it gets to a water body, stores it and then sends it to a wastewater treatment plant for cleanup."]},{"begin":"849.240","end":"861.560","lines":["So he actually told me a bit about this time that he got to visit the site of that project.

This is probably just as logical of a solution, besides, you know, replacing all the pipes or scaling up the wastewater treatment\u2019s capacity. But basically this basin, even though it sounds like it would be maybe the cheaper option, is still pretty expensive: they spent \u20ac90 million on it; that\u2019s about $97 million.
