It was accelerated by the Trump administration to replace and upgrade the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal \u2014 at a projected cost of upward of $1.5 trillion over the next 30 years. It\u2019s a project that will perpetuate, until at least 2075, the little-known role that my tribe\u2014the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota\u2014plays in U.S. National Security policy: to be a nuclear target.

[CLIP: Air Force environmental impact statement video: \u201cThe National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, is a federal law that requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making process."},{"author":"Weber","text":"NEPA review is required when a federal action is proposed that may have impacts on the human or natural environment. NEPA includes requirements for involvement of the public and government entities and, in the case of this project, 62 Native American Tribes.\u201d]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the U.S. Air Force is required to produce an environmental impact statement. In this case, it\u2019s to\u00a0\u201canalyze the potential effects on the human and natural environments from deployment of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system.\u201d Also, it\u2019s to\u00a0\u201cprovide the public and other stakeholders an opportunity to comment on the action and associated analyses, and to consider all alternatives.\u201d [CLIP: MHA Nation honor song]"},{"author":"Weber","text":"The Fort Berthold reservation was the first place picked by the Air Force to present this report at a public hearing and collect public comments on the record. This was an opportunity for the Air Force to connect with the MHA Nation and to explain the military branch\u2019s plans and what they meant for the reservation. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t exactly what happened."},{"author":"Logan Davis","text":"That public hearing? Meaningless. You know why it\u2019s meaningless? Because nobody was really informed, nobody was able to give the testimony they wanted to do, and nobody had a clear picture because nobody was prepared. I certainly wasn\u2019t prepared."},{"author":"Weber","text":"Logan Davis is a freelance journalist, an army veteran and an elder of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota. He\u2019s been reporting on the MHA Nation for a long time and happened to be on the reservation that day. He learned about the EIS meeting by chance.

He\u2019s like, \u201cHey Logan, you going to that environmental impact study meeting?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m a journalist, and nobody told me. I didn\u2019t know about it until this cop called me. So nobody knew about it. So I was calling people, \u201cHey, you gotta get over here; you gotta testify,\u201d you know?"},{"author":"Weber","text":"Davis\u2019s struggle to find where the meeting was taking place was confusing. The Air Force had advertised for weeks in local newspapers and on the radio that the meeting would take place at the New Town Powwow grounds. But for some reason, the location of the meeting was changed last minute\u2014to the Four Bears Casino."},{"author":"Davis","text":"The cop was there. I sat with him. And I said, \u201cAre you going to testify?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he goes. \u201cIf somebody else does.\u201d And I just looked around, and there is just very few people from this community. It was mostly Air Force people. Nobody told any of the journalists or any news person. It was so highly secretive. And that bothers me. So they did this whole video thing [on] how great it\u2019s going to be, blah, blah, blah, jobs, and it was just like, okay, you guys are not telling the truth."},{"author":"Weber","text":"In case you\u2019re wondering, the video that\u2019s being talked about is the one that we played at the beginning of this episode. It\u2019s about the environmental impact statement of the Sentinel Program."},{"author":"Davis","text":"They never talked about war. They didn\u2019t talk about jobs. They talked about how it\u2019s going to benefit the community, for the most part. My forte is journalism\u2014and I started asking questions and they took the general out of the meeting, out of the building, out of the area of testimony. They left! And then we\u2019re, they said we\u2019re going to have an intermission.\u00a0 When we come back, they were starting the public testimony. But where the hell is the chairman, where the hell is the major general? They should be here listening to the public testimony."},{"author":"Weber","text":"As it turned out, Davis was the only one who had filled the sign-in sheet at the meeting entrance. And he was called up first."},{"author":"Davis","text":"I\u2019ve always felt nervous about being in North Dakota because there\u2019s so many nuclear missiles here. I testified that I know there\u2019s always a chance for incidents and accidents and nuclear accidents. They\u2019re not all going to be like Chernobyl, but it could be. And when you\u2019re messing with warheads, you know, you have to be, you know, so precise, and, you know, there\u2019s a process and procedure and safety."},{"author":"Weber","text":"So Logan\u2019s a reporter.

Our ancestral teachings as Native Americans teach us to respect, honor Mother Earth, not to put toxics, crap in her."},{"author":"Weber","text":"This was a lot to take in.
