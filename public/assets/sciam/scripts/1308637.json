For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman."},{"author":"","text":"For many people today is all about scrambling to get last-minute dinner reservations and spending lots of money\u2014I mean, uh, showing your significant other how much you care about them."},{"author":"","text":"But what about your other significant others? What about Galentine\u2019s Day and Palentine\u2019s Day?"},{"author":"","text":"Today\u2019s guest wants to help us understand that non-romantic love and partnership can change our lives for the better. Rhaina Cohen is a producer and editor for NPR\u2019s Embedded podcast and she\u2019s also the author of the book The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life with Friendship at the Center. She\u2019s here today to share what she\u2019s learned about the history and psychology of human friendship."},{"author":"","text":"Rhaina, thanks so much for joining us today."},{"author":"Rhaina Cohen","text":"Glad to get to talk about this."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"So what inspired you to write this book?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"I fell into a friendship that, for me, really defied even what the definition of friendship was."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cHandwriting,\u201d by Frank Jonsson]"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"My friend, who I refer to as \u201cM,\u201d she and I became much more like partners pretty quickly. I felt a kind of excitement about our friendship that surpassed anything that I had felt before. We were incorporated into each other\u2019s routines in a way that I think is more reminiscent of a romantic relationship, where you\u2019re, you know, seeing each other most days of the week, bringing each other to your office holiday parties, know what it is that your friend cooks all the time and what foods they won\u2019t eat and adjusting your recipes, you know, accordingly. So the friendship opened up questions for both of us about, \u201cWhat do we call each other? Why isn\u2019t there a name for this kind of friendship that can feel really devoted, and what does it say about our expectations of romantic relationships, as well, that we can\u2019t conceive of partnership as anything other than involving romance?\u201d"},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And as that friendship developed, how did other people react to, you know, this partnership becoming so important for you?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"I think we were quite lucky in that people were really positive. It could be because my friend is, like\u2014just everybody loves her. She\u2019s, like, very radiant. And I think it\u2019s not that big of a surprise for someone to wanna be kind of attached at the hip to her, though I guess that doesn\u2019t explain maybe on her end of things. We did experience some longing that people had for a friendship as close as ours."},{"author":"","text":"You know, I went on to talk to other people who had these kinds of friendships, and they did not always get the same kind of positive responses. They would be gossiped about, particularly if there were straight men involved, that at least one person, you know, must be in love with the other, that they\u2019re closeted or they\u2019re denying to themselves that their relationship is really romantic. I mean, there\u2019s a whole gamut of kind of much more critical responses that I\u2019ve heard people get, including being blocked from, you know, seeing someone in the hospital because they are not truly related, and I think that kind of judgment was something that we were spared from."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, how do you think we got to where we are now in terms of what, you know, seems normal, at least in Western culture, for friendships versus romantic relationships?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"Well, there\u2019re, yeah, a few big changes that we don\u2019t even recognize because we\u2019re probably just taking for granted that friendship is this secondary part of life and that marriage or a romantic relationship takes up the bulk of one\u2019s social life."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cThose Rainy Days,\u201d by Elm Lake]"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"And if you\u2019re looking a couple hundred years ago, marriage was an economic relationship, first and foremost, one that was not between equals, and now we expect a romantic partner to be a best friend and to be your No. 1, and that doesn\u2019t really make sense in a context where one person owns the other, where you don\u2019t have equality, and that\u2019s kind of a foundation of any kind of friend-type relationship. So you have this sort of ballooning of the significance of marriage and what people expect of it and how much space it takes up in their lives."},{"author":"","text":"And then friendships that used to be extremely intimate\u2014I mean, there\u2019re, like, so many very kind of vivid examples of this\u2014became suspect around the turn of the 20th century, once you have the introduction of the concept of homosexuality and heterosexuality. It didn\u2019t used to be that you were marked as a certain kind of person if you had sex with somebody of the same gender. So behavior that had been innocent, like bed-sharing or\u2014just, like, you can look at photos from the late 1800s, early 1900s of men being so close up to each other. As a lot of people might see it now, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, those men were in love with each other. They were gay.\u201d So there was just sort of less room for intimate friendship and much more room and expectations of marriage."},{"author":"","text":"So we have this message that marriage is supposed to be the most important relationship in your life, supposed to be your best friend, and so on. But there\u2019s a disconnect with the reality, which is that marriage rates have plummeted, and for those who do get married, they\u2019re likely to get married much later than they were several decades ago. And this has opened up, I think, a lot of space and an appetite for people to figure out: \u201cWhat do alternatives look like? Is there really only one path to having a fulfilled life?\u201d And that\u2019s where, I think, you\u2019re seeing some of this innovation and thinking more expansively about friendship coming from. There\u2019s an appetite for more creativity, to know that there\u2019s more than one option, whether because you never get married, or you have a romantic relationship and you survive your spouse, or the relationship ends, and knowing that there are other ways to find these really core needs."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"And based on the research you did for your book, how do you think that this de-emphasis on friendship hurts us as individuals and, you know, maybe even hurts our marriages and other romantic partnerships as well?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"By expecting so much of marriage and so little of friendship, we end up undermining our romantic relationships, kind of setting them up to fail, and we diminish and weaken our friendships by expecting so little of them and not really investing in them. And on the romantic relationship front, there\u2019s research looking at how people who, in a sense, diversify their emotional portfolio\u2014as in have more than one close person that they can turn to if something, you know, serious or significant happens\u2014that they are happier, have more stable marriages, more satisfying marriages than people who really always go, first and foremost, to their spouse."},{"author":"","text":"I like to think of it as the model of a kind of big-box store, is what people have in mind: you get everything in one place, and it\u2019s really efficient. But we also know that there are consequences when big-box stores enter, you know, enter communities and that sometimes doing something that\u2019s, like, not all in one place or getting everything in one aisle can have some other benefits, and I think that that\u2019s certainly the case for having not just your spouse, who is your best friend and your confidant and your career coach and your roommate and your, you know, co-parent, and so on, but having other people that you really care about."},{"author":"","text":"And just for the flip side of friendship, if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an important relationship or it\u2019s going to be there in the long haul, then you\u2019re probably, you know, going to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy and not think about the ways that a friendship can be more enduring or be more central to your life."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"What other research did you find that looked into the importance of these non-romantic friendships and partnerships?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"The research on friendship is not, like, the best research. You know, there\u2019s not, I think, particularly on adult friendship, the most robust work on this. And I\u2019ve talked to researchers and they have very much admitted this, and I think part of it is: it is harder to study when it\u2019s not a kind of clear dyadic relationship in the way that you would with a spouse."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cLet There Be Rain,\u201d by Silver Maple]"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"So the research that I look at ends up being more around surveys\u2014so asking people about the number of close friends in their lives or, you know, \u201cIf something difficult happens, who is the first person that you\u2019re going to reach out to?\u201d And we\u2019ve seen that, over just a number of decades, that Americans report having fewer close friends than they had previously. One researcher has called this a \u201cfriendship recession\u201d and has done follow-up research that\u2019s really shown that there\u2019s a class difference: that people who are less educated are even less likely to have a robust circle of friends and less likely to have the kind of spaces\u2014community spaces where they can go to and cultivate these friendships. It just would have been the case that a few decades ago people would\u2019ve had multiple close people to turn to and that that\u2019s become a lot less common and it\u2019s become far more common for people to have no friends at all."},{"author":"","text":"To the question of, \u201cWho do people turn to first with a personal problem?\u201d In 1990 [more than] a quarter of people said a friend, and now that\u2019s only 16 percent and more than half say their spouse. So there really is this kind of shift that\u2019s happened where people have diverted activities or kind of devotion that they would have given to friends to spouses instead."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right."},{"author":"Cohen","text":"There\u2019s a gender divide on this, too, which might not be so surprising\u2014I think there\u2019s growing recognition that American men are having a harder time cultivating deep friendships than women are, and you can see this in, also, how men and women behave in their friendships. So, you know, within the last week about half of women have told their friends that they love them, and that\u2019s a quarter of men\u2014so, you know, much lower rate. There have been researchers who\u2019ve asked questions like, \u201cHave you had a private conversation with a friend in the last week where you\u2019ve shared personal feelings?\u201d And the answer is about half for women and about a third for men, so the kind of emotional intimacy that women are more likely to have in their friendships, we\u2019re seeing less so in men\u2019s friendships."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Hmm. So what advice do you have for people who are looking to expand their definition of a significant other?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"One thing I would suggest is unbundling what your current definition is of a significant other or romantic partner\u2014that people pile things together that can be disaggregated. So one example would be that in order to have a long-term partnership you have to live together and that you have to be compatible in that way. And that can be hard to kind of separate when our culture tells us that that\u2019s the right way to do things, and what I have seen is, with people who are friends, when they start kind of disaggregating one part, like taking sex out of partnership, they can also be more thoughtful about what other parts they want to keep and not."},{"author":"","text":"So two women who I interviewed who have been raising a child together, they realized, like, they\u2019re not the best fit to live together: one is very messy; one is very neat. So instead, they are vertical neighbors\u2014they have condos in the same building\u2014and that is the situation that works for them. So that\u2019s an example of a kind of thing that\u2014there\u2019s so much in this kind of big-box store or one-stop-shop model of partnership, and you don\u2019t need to take all of it. And that means that if you want a romantic partnership and you\u2014maybe you have a great romantic partner but they don\u2019t fit all the pieces, that also leaves space for other people in your life to fill those roles, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s something wrong with the romantic relationship or that you need to go out and find somebody who\u2019s going to fit everything, because odds are, they probably aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just really hard to do that."},{"author":"","text":"And maybe the other kind of recommendation, in terms of being more imaginative about what a significant other means, is thinking really specifically about the role of sex and romance in what it means to be close to another person. It\u2019s something that came up as I interviewed people who had these really close friendships, was that they realized what mattered to them was companionship and having somebody, you know, who was home at the end of the day, who could hand them a mug of tea if they were feeling awful. And it didn\u2019t mean that romance and sex wasn\u2019t important, and it might be something that they, you know, still seek out with relationships, but it wasn\u2019t the most important thing that determined whether they wanted to commit to somebody else. So I think being able to kind of disaggregate commitment and love from these other pieces that we have been told all have to go together can make it possible to see that there are more types of significant others."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Right. I can imagine that some people react to the topic of your book as, you know, maybe being kind of radical and bucking tradition. But what does history actually tell us about traditional family structures?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"History is really relevant where\u2014we use the term \u201ctraditional\u201d to describe the nuclear family, so two-parent household. You know, if you count tradition as a couple\u2014maybe a couple hundred years, a few hundred years, like, that\u2019s true, but if you\u2019re looking at the scale of thousands of years, it doesn\u2019t look that traditional. What you would instead see are extended families, like polygamy, other kinds of ways that people arranged marriage and child-rearing. The anthropologist Sarah Hrdy has looked at the way that kids have been cared for across time and that a significant number of caregivers were not biologically related to the child that they were taking care of, and she calls them \u201calloparents\u201d and that there would have never been a human species without alloparents."},{"author":"","text":"So instead of this idea that at max you have two people who are biologically related to a child who\u2019s taking care of them, in fact, something that, you know, has been more common is having these unrelated people, and that does make this, I think, look much less radical. And I\u2019ve\u2014some people that I\u2019ve talked to have described raising kids with friends, for instance, or kind of living in clusters with friends is remixing tradition: so it\u2019s taking pieces of the past but allowing you to choose who that extended family is rather than having it be assigned to you."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Yeah, totally. If somebody called it \u201cpaleo parenting,\u201d then, you know, we\u2019d never hear the end of it; everybody would wanna do it."},{"author":"Cohen","text":"I\u2019m not good enough at branding to have thought of that."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"[Laughs] Well, this is airing on Valentine\u2019s Day. So what lessons about love do you hope that our listeners and your readers can take away from your work?"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"I hope they\u2019ll take away that there\u2019s more than one kind of love that exists."},{"author":"","text":"[CLIP: \u201cRainshower,\u201d by Johannes Bornl\u00f6f]"},{"author":"Cohen","text":"And maybe people recognize, okay, there\u2019s romantic love and maybe parental love, like parent-child kind of relationship, but those are not the only types of love that exist and the only forms of commitment that exist."},{"author":"","text":"I have been so moved by the people who I\u2019ve talked to who have been there for every single cancer treatment for their friend or who have have seen each other through crises, who have bought homes together, who have taken care of each other\u2019s children, who have shown every kind of devotion that you can possibly imagine and do it with no social recognition, no applause by people around them, no ceremony. So not only, I guess, do they show that this type of love and devotion exists\u2014and I would like listeners to recognize that\u2014I think looking out for it and celebrating it and acknowledging it when you see it happening can help us reinforce that those forms of care really matter."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"Absolutely. Thank you so much for coming on to chat today."},{"author":"Cohen","text":"Thanks for having me on for this unconventional Valentine\u2019s Day conversation."},{"author":"Feltman","text":"That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

So, you know, within the last week about half of women have told their friends that they love them, and that\u2019s a quarter of men\u2014so, you know, much lower rate.

So one example would be that in order to have a long-term partnership you have to live together and that you have to be compatible in that way. And that can be hard to kind of separate when our culture tells us that that\u2019s the right way to do things, and what I have seen is, with people who are friends, when they start kind of disaggregating one part, like taking sex out of partnership, they can also be more thoughtful about what other parts they want to keep and not."]},{"begin":"647.080","end":"693.720","lines":["So two women who I interviewed who have been raising a child together, they realized, like, they\u2019re not the best fit to live together: one is very messy; one is very neat.

So that\u2019s an example of a kind of thing that\u2014there\u2019s so much in this kind of big-box store or one-stop-shop model of partnership, and you don\u2019t need to take all of it. And that means that if you want a romantic partnership and you\u2014maybe you have a great romantic partner but they don\u2019t fit all the pieces, that also leaves space for other people in your life to fill those roles, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s something wrong with the romantic relationship or that you need to go out and find somebody who\u2019s going to fit everything, because odds are, they probably aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just really hard to do that."]},{"begin":"693.720","end":"742.520","lines":["And maybe the other kind of recommendation, in terms of being more imaginative about what a significant other means, is thinking really specifically about the role of sex and romance in what it means to be close to another person. It\u2019s something that came up as I interviewed people who had these really close friendships, was that they realized what mattered to them was companionship and having somebody, you know, who was home at the end of the day, who could hand them a mug of tea if they were feeling awful. And it didn\u2019t mean that romance and sex wasn\u2019t important, and it might be something that they, you know, still seek out with relationships, but it wasn\u2019t the most important thing that determined whether they wanted to commit to somebody else.

You know, if you count tradition as a couple\u2014maybe a couple hundred years, a few hundred years, like, that\u2019s true, but if you\u2019re looking at the scale of thousands of years, it doesn\u2019t look that traditional. What you would instead see are extended families, like polygamy, other kinds of ways that people arranged marriage and child-rearing. The anthropologist Sarah Hrdy has looked at the way that kids have been cared for across time and that a significant number of caregivers were not biologically related to the child that they were taking care of, and she calls them \u201calloparents\u201d and that there would have never been a human species without alloparents."]},{"begin":"800.800","end":"835.240","lines":["So instead of this idea that at max you have two people who are biologically related to a child who\u2019s taking care of them, in fact, something that, you know, has been more common is having these unrelated people, and that does make this, I think, look much less radical. And I\u2019ve\u2014some people that I\u2019ve talked to have described raising kids with friends, for instance, or kind of living in clusters with friends is remixing tradition: so it\u2019s taking pieces of the past but allowing you to choose who that extended family is rather than having it be assigned to you."]},{"begin":"835.240","end":"840.840","lines":["Yeah, totally.
