      "text": "I\u2019m Duy Linh Tu, and this is Scientific American\u2019s 60-Second Science. Hurricane Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast on Sunday.\u00a0By landfall, it was a category 4 storm. A-hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds brought down trees, power lines, even whole buildings.\u00a0Over a million people have lost power in the state, and [at the time of recording] at least one person has died. I\u2019m a documentary filmmaker.\u00a0 Just two weeks ago, I was in the same place where Ida came ashore. I was working on another film for Scientific American,\u00a0this one about Louisiana\u2019s attempts to save its coastline after decades of erosion.\u00a0 Ida is just another massive blow to a state that still loses a football field of coastline every hour. During my reporting, I had met Theresa and Donald Dardar, a couple in their 60s from the Pointe-Au-Chien\u00a0Native American tribe. Their community lives right along the Gulf Coast and has seen over 90 percent of their land lost to erosion over the past several decades. But unlike many in the area, the couple never moved."

      "text": "That was Theresa speaking to me in my first film about coastal erosion in Louisiana.\u00a0At the time, she and her husband Donald had no plans to leave their home, no matter how threatening the waters or winds got. But this weekend, with Ida bearing down, mandatory evacuations were called. Theresa and Donald loaded up their car with their two dogs and headed to Texarkana, Tex., a six-hour drive away.\u00a0This was the only place they could find a hotel. They had to leave most of their possessions, including Donald\u2019s five-year-old horse Pretty Girl, back on the levee. I\u2019ve been calling and texting with Theresa throughout the weekend.\u00a0We\u2019ve been sharing what little information we have about possible damage to her home and community. This was my most recent call to her. [Phone rings]"

It looks like a war zone because there\u2019s so much damage, so much devastation in the community. And then we didn\u2019t think that there was water because, you know\u2014well, Donald says, \u201cThis is the big one,\u201d then, \u201cWell, no, not really because we didn\u2019t get water.\u201d But now we know that we did get water because [inaudible] and the sheriff were not able to go any further than the Pointe Aux Chenes supermarket because of the water."

Everything is in God\u2019s hands, and that\u2019s what [trails off]. I have to let go because I can\u2019t control it, you know?"

Donald and Theresa plan to drive the six hours back home today to begin cleanup.\u00a0But the roads leading up to their house are still flooded and unpassable. Theresa says they\u2019ll figure things out when they get there. For Scientific American\u2019s 60-second science, I\u2019m Duy Linh Tu. [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.]"
