Hurricane Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast on Sunday.\u00a0By landfall, it was a category 4 storm. A-hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds brought down trees, power lines, even whole buildings.\u00a0Over a million people have lost power in the state, and [at the time of recording] at least one person has died.

During my reporting, I had met Theresa and Donald Dardar, a couple in their 60s from the Pointe-Au-Chien\u00a0Native American tribe. Their community lives right along the Gulf Coast and has seen over 90 percent of their land lost to erosion over the past several decades. But unlike many in the area, the couple never moved."},{"author":"Theresa Dardar: ","text":"Sure we could build a house, buy a house somewhere else, but it would never be the same. This is the roots. Just like a plant:\u00a0when you deroot\u00a0a plant, and you leave it in the sun, it\u2019s going to die."},{"author":"Tu:'","text":"That was Theresa speaking to me in my first film about coastal erosion in Louisiana.\u00a0At the time, she and her husband Donald had no plans to leave their home, no matter how threatening the waters or winds got. But this weekend, with Ida bearing down, mandatory evacuations were called. Theresa and Donald loaded up their car with their two dogs and headed to Texarkana, Tex., a six-hour drive away.\u00a0This was the only place they could find a hotel. They had to leave most of their possessions, including Donald\u2019s five-year-old horse Pretty Girl, back on the levee."},{"author":"Tu:'","text":"I\u2019ve been calling and texting with Theresa throughout the weekend.\u00a0We\u2019ve been sharing what little information we have about possible damage to her home and community.

You know, trees down, poles snapping. And\u00a0we heard that homes were lost, and we heard Donald\u2019s uncle lost his home. It looks like a war zone because there\u2019s so much damage, so much devastation in the community. And then we didn\u2019t think that there was water because, you know\u2014well, Donald says, \u201cThis is the big one,\u201d then, \u201cWell, no, not really because we didn\u2019t get water.\u201d But now we know that we did get water because [inaudible] and the sheriff were not able to go any further than the Pointe Aux Chenes supermarket because of the water."},{"author":"Tu:'","text":"Theresa has been getting updates from her relatives who stayed behind, when their cell phones work.

You know, the news about our community--a lot of people don't...a lot of people don\u2019t even know our community even exists, or that our tribes even exist."},{"author":"Tu:'","text":"So do you think that this is the big one? You and I have talked about this and Donald and I have talked about this. We keep on talking about, you know, the coast eroding and the dangers of that. Was this big one that we...or that you have been worried about for a while or that your community has been worried about?"},{"author":"Dardar","text":"We hope it was the big one that we don't get any bigger. Well, I don't know what we have left. If it\u2019s not the big one,\u00a0I would hate to see what the big one gonna look\u00a0like. And right now we have no running water, no gas and no electricity."},{"author":"Tu","text":"Do you have any word about when that might come back?"},{"author":"Dardar","text":"We have no idea. We have propane\u2014a little gas stove that we use in the\u00a0boat. We can cook on that. But we\u2019ll have buy water, you know, to bathe in. And we\u2019ll have to use bayou water to flush the toilet. My prayer is that we have a home to go back to and that everybody has a home to go to. I know it might not be the case. Everything is in God\u2019s hands, and that\u2019s what [trails off]. I have to let go because I can\u2019t control it, you know?"},{"author":"Tu:'","text":"A few hours after we talked, Theresa texted me some good news:\u00a0A cousin had checked on her house, and it was still standing\u2014a lot of damage but still standing.\u00a0And\u00a0Donald\u2019s horse had survived the storm. Donald and Theresa plan to drive the six hours back home today to begin cleanup.\u00a0But the roads leading up to their house are still flooded and unpassable.

Hurricane Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast on Sunday.\u00a0By landfall, it was a category 4 storm. A-hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds brought down trees, power lines, even whole buildings.\u00a0Over a million people have lost power in the state, and [at the time of recording] at least one person has died. I\u2019m a documentary filmmaker.\u00a0 Just two weeks ago, I was in the same place where Ida came ashore."]},{"begin":"32.360","end":"62.160","lines":["I was working on another film for Scientific American,\u00a0this one about Louisiana\u2019s attempts to save its coastline after decades of erosion.\u00a0 Ida is just another massive blow to a state that still loses a football field of coastline every hour. During my reporting, I had met Theresa and Donald Dardar, a couple in their 60s from the Pointe-Au-Chien\u00a0Native American tribe. Their community lives right along the Gulf Coast and has seen over 90 percent of their land lost to erosion over the past several decades. But unlike many in the area, the couple never moved."]},{"begin":"62.160","end":"79.280","lines":["Sure we could build a house, buy a house somewhere else, but it would never be the same.

Theresa and Donald loaded up their car with their two dogs and headed to Texarkana, Tex., a six-hour drive away.\u00a0This was the only place they could find a hotel.
