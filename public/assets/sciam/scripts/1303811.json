I\u2019m Karen Hopkin. After an exhausting day at the office, it\u2019s hard not to smile when you\u2019re greeted by a delirious display of uncontrolled canine joy. [Dog greeting] But it\u2019s not just the happy yapping and wriggling tail wagging that tug at our heartstrings. [Dog greeting] Because a new study shows that dogs\u2019 eyes fill with tears when reunited with their people\u2026an effect that evokes our nurturing instincts. The findings appear in the journal Current Biology.\u00a0\u00a0 Takefumi Kikusui became interested in doggies\u2019 damp and adoring gazes while watching his pet poodle interact with her pups."},{"author":"Takefumi Kikusui","text":": When she was nursing her puppies, her face becomes so cute. Of course she\u2019s so cute as always. But more."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": At some point Kikusui, who\u2019s a professor of veterinary medicine at Azabu University in Japan, realized that his adorable mama dog had tears in her eyes. That potential connection between unbearable cuteness and unshed tears sent Kikusui scurrying away from his poodle and back to the lab."},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": In the test, we initially measure the baseline tear volumes when dogs were together with the owner in their house."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": Then the owner would high-tail it off for five or six hours."},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": When the owner came back, we measure tear volume again. And found that the reunion with the owner stimulate tear secretion."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": But it only worked with the dog\u2019s owner."},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": There was no increase in tears when the dogs were separated from the owner and reunited with the dogs\u2019 caretaker in a dog care center."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": The researchers suspected that the tearful reaction was stimulated by oxytocin\u2026a hormone associated with social bonding. They had shown previously that oxytocin is boosted when dogs interact with their owners. And oxytocin receptors have been found to be abundant in the glands that secrete tears in mice."},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": So we applied oxytocin to the dogs\u2019 eyes."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": And voila\u2026the dogs grew weepy. But to what end? In other words, is there some benefit to this lachrymose behavior? To find out, Kikusui and his colleagues showed volunteers a couple of hound head shots."},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": One was a normal dog face. And the other was teary dog face in which we added artificial tears."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": The volunteers were more likely to want to cuddle and care for the mutts with big, wet puppy-dog eyes\u2026"},{"author":"Kikusui","text":": \u2026suggesting that teary eyes of dogs can facilitate the human caregiving behavior."},{"author":"Hopkin","text":": So dogs turn on the waterworks and their owners roll over. Now, that\u2019s quite a clever trick!
