In the case of this study, they used a subset of participants from a database called the UK Biobank that started up in 2006. Specifically, they looked at the genes and self-reported information from about 450,000 British people\u2013 all white and all between the ages of 40 and 69 years old at the time that they participated in the Biobank survey."

They also found that the specific genes correlated with bisexual behavior in men were distinct from the ones correlated with exclusively same-sex behavior."

And remember these are just correlations and we\u2019re talking about self-reported behavior, not peoples\u2019 actual identities or sexual orientations.  And sidebar: As a bisexual person, honestly at first I was kind of excited about this study finding. So much of the societal response to bisexuality comes in the form of dismissal or invalidation. People have a lot of trouble accepting that bisexuals exist."

The researchers found that men with the genes associated with bisexual behavior also had genes associated with a self-reported propensity for risk-taking.

They found that, in these ostensibly straight men, the bisexual genes and the risky genes were also associated with a higher number of self-reported sexual partners. The researchers go on to hypothesize that this could be an evolutionary explanation for why the bisexual gene variants and bisexual behavior persists in the population: Because maybe bisexual genes lead straight men to have more sex and thus more children. In the words of the lead study author Jianzhi \u201cGeorge\u201d Zhang, \u201cThe basic finding is that bisexual behavior and number of children are genetically positively correlated.\u201d"

Joanna Wuest, who is an assistant professor of gender and sexuality politics at Mount Holyoke College, said \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of storytelling based around not a lot of data.\u201d"

There was a really big example that came out in 2019, which found genetic factors only seem to account for between 8 and 25 percent of sexual orientation."

      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "Exactly, but even with that research, there are caveats. The biggest one being that\u2013 again\u2013 GWAS can reveal associations but not prove directional effects. Agustin Fuentes, an anthropology professor at Princeton University, told me he believes \u201cGWASs show you much less than some people think they do\u2026they tell you nothing about cause and effect.\u201dAnd the correlations that GWASs bring up might not actually be the ones that scientists think they\u2019re studying."

    {
      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "Yeah, and beyond. So people are complicated, identity, personality, and behavior are tricky to pin down and define, and genetic researchers are constructing these proxy categories for human traits (like sexuality or riskiness) that are really limited. In Fuentes\u2019 words, being bisexual \u201cdoes not necessarily mean a person has had sex with someone with a penis and someone with a vagina.\u201d But the recent study and others define the category that way, based on peoples\u2019 own self-reported sexual history."

    {
      "author": "Bose: ",
      "text": "That seems fraught, especially when you\u2019re talking about middle-aged-plus people in a country where same-sex acts were a criminal offense into the 1980s. And like, stigma exists. Maybe social conditions have kept people from engaging in same-sex acts even if they wanted to. Maybe people don\u2019t share accurate sexual histories with scientists."
    },
    {
      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "Absolutely, plus even the term \u201csex\u201d is so subjective. People lie and omit things intentionally, but also respondents might not even agree on what the question they\u2019re answering actually means. Sex to one person might just be heavy petting to another. And I mean, \u201crisk-taking\u201d who is going to agree on what counts as \u201crisk-taking\u201d?Bose: Ooh ok and not to get too conspiracy theory-ey\u2026 but maybe even answering questions about same-sex behavior before the risk-taking question could have primed people to think of themselves as more risk tolerant and then describe themselves that way."
    },
    {
      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s a possibility\u2013 though there\u2019d need to be way more research to figure that out for sure. Either way, the point is that the categories that this study of bisexuality and lots of genetic studies rely on are deeply imperfect. Plus, each of the genetic correlations these GWASs find only seem to play a teeny tiny role in peoples\u2019 behavior anyway.\u00a0Reily pointed out that one of the findings from the 2019 GWAS was that younger UK Biobank participants reported about three-times as much same-sex behavior as the older cohort. It\u2019s very, very unlikely that that\u2019s a genetic or biological thing."

    {
      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "It\u2019s a valid question. Some scientists would rather people weren\u2019t using GWASs this way at all. I mean, it\u2019s a method that was originally designed to study diseases, not dig into the normal spectrum of human behavior and identity. But, in a perfect world, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Scientific inquiry is great, applying methods to new questions can yield fascinating results. But as Reily emphasized in our conversation, the world is far from perfect."
    },
    {
      "author": "Bose: ",
      "text": "Uh, agreed. And this idea of risky bisexuals that have more partners, it seems like it feeds into some nasty stereotypes. I mean, there\u2019s a history here. Like during the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, bisexual people were scapegoated as promiscuous viral vectors, spreading disease as they jumped from partner to partner."
    },
    {
      "author": "Leffer: ",
      "text": "Absolutely, Wuest brought up exactly that point when I spoke with her. There\u2019s also a parallel problem of genetic research being willfully twisted to support racist ideology. And that 2019 sexuality GWAS led to some misuses as well, like a misguided app that claimed it could tell users \u201chow gay\u201d they were based on genetic data. The app got taken down, but Reilly worries the idea of a genetic test for sexual orientation may have stuck."
