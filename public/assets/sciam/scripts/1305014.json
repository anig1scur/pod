A perennial \u2013 dare I say, timeless\u2013topic of science fiction, but is it possible? Is there any chance at all that it could actually happen?"},{"author":"Lee Billings","text":"No. No, no no no no. (laughs). Well, kinda. Not really. ARGH. I\u2019m Lee Billings."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"I\u2019m Clara Moskowitz, and this is Cosmos, Quickly, the biweekly space podcast from Scientific American. [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"We\u2019re going to have a little friendly debate."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Really? I came for a throwdown."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"Well, a wrangle. A parley. A confab. Lee, what do you have against time travel?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"So I love the idea of time travel! And in fact I do it all the time\u2014like most everyone else I\u2019m traveling into the future at one second per second. I\u2019m less of a fan, though, of more speculative time travel, which is good fodder for goofy sci-fi stories, but in the real world it\u2019s an implausible distraction."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"But really, we can stay within plausible physics and still see how more extreme versions of time travel are possible. See, Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity shows that the rate time flows at depends on how fast you\u2019re moving."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Einstein strikes again, what a rascal."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"If you\u2019re traveling in a starship at close to the speed of light, you\u2019ll still experience the familiar one-second-per-second ticking of a clock\u2013 but an observer back on Earth would see your clock moving glacially slow. To them, you\u2019d be moving through time at a snail\u2019s pace. That means that when you finally got back,\u00a0 maybe only a year would have passed for you, but a century could have gone by for your friends on Earth. Ergo, you just traveled to the future!"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Right, right, no one\u2019s disputing any of that! We can even measure this sort of \u201ctime dilation\u201d right now on Earth, not with starships, but with subatomic particles. Some of those particles have very short lifetimes, decaying almost instantaneously. But if we drastically speed them up, like in a particle accelerator, we find they endure longer in proportion to how fast they\u2019re going. So riddle me this, though, Clara: How can we travel into the past? That\u2019s something so hard to do\u2013effectively impossible, almost\u2013that it\u2019s scarcely worth thinking about."},{"author":"Billings","text":"[Clip: Back to the Future: \u201cThis is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor!\u201d]"},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"I get it\u2014no one has yet conceived of a way to journey to the past. But the crazy thing is it\u2019s not impossible. Time is one of the four dimensions in the universe, along with three dimensions of space. And we move through space in all directions just fine, and according to physics, travel through time should be just as possible. One way that people have looked into is via a wormhole\u2014a shortcut bridge through spacetime that was predicted by general relativity."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"Wormholes can connect distant points in spacetime, meaning you could conceivably use one to bridge not just the gap between here and a distant galaxy, but the span between 2023 and 1923.\u00a0 [CLIP: Interstellar: \u201cThat\u2019s the wormhole.\u201d]"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Ah yes, wormholes\u2014the last refuge of scoundrels and desperate physicists. The trouble with wormholes Clara, is that, unlike a DeLorean, we have no evidence they actually exist\u2014and, even if they did, it seems the only ways to make them traversable and stable involves using negative energy or negative mass\u00a0 to prop them open. And, guess what, just like wormholes themselves, we have no evidence these weird forms of matter and energy actually exist, either."},{"author":"Billings","text":"And let\u2019s just beat this dead horse one more time\u2014even if wormholes exist, as well as the means to make them traversable, to go back in time seems to require anchoring one end in a region of very warped spacetime, like around a black hole, or accelerating it to nearly lightspeed. Are you sensing a theme here, Clara?"},{"author":"Moskowitz:'","text":"Yeah, yeah. All I can say is that just because there\u2019s no evidence any of these things exist, there\u2019s also no evidence they don\u2019t or can\u2019t exist. Wormholes are real solutions to the equations of general relativity, and even negative energy and mass are concepts that come up in the math and aren\u2019t prohibited."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Well how about some more practical arguments, then? If time travel were possible, wouldn\u2019t we have met some time travelers by now? Wouldn\u2019t someone have gone back and killed Hitler\u2014or at least prevented me from wearing that ridiculous outfit to my high school prom? You know there\u2019s a famous story about physicist Stephen Hawking, who invited time travelers to come to a party he was holding. The trick was the the party happened in 2009, but the invitation came out in a miniseries that was broadcast in 2010\u2014thus, only time travelers would have been able to attend."},{"author":"Billings","text":"[CLIP: Stephen Hawking Time Travel Party: \u201cHere is the invitation, giving the exact coordinates in time and space. I am hoping in one form or another it will survive for many thousands of years.\u201d]"},{"author":"Billings","text":"Sadly, the hors d'oeuvres went uneaten and the champagne sat unopened, because, clearly, time travel to the past is impossible!"},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"I admit a party with Stephen Hawking should have been pretty alluring to time travelers, if they were out there. But you\u2019re forgetting about the International Clause of Secrecy that all time travelers probably have to swear to, making sure to hide their identities and abilities from those in earlier eras."},{"author":"Billings","text":"Hmm, yes the clause of secrecy here. Feels like we\u2019re really veering into science fiction territory special pleading here. And don\u2019t forget all the paradoxes that we have to worry about too. There are lots of good reasons to think time travel might introduce insurmountable paradoxes in physics. The most famous being the grandfather\u2014or grandmother\u2014paradox."},{"author":"Billings","text":"If time travel were possible into the past, so the thinking goes, then a person could go back in time and kill their own grandparents, thus making it impossible for them to be born and impossible for them to travel back in time to ever commit the murder, and so on and so on."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"I wonder if it could be like a many-worlds scenario, where each change a time traveler makes to the past spawns a whole new universe that carries on from that point. So if I went back in time and killed one of my forebears, then a new branch universe would begin where that whole line of descendents, including me, never existed. I mean, it sounds crazy, but then again, physics is pretty enamored with multiverses, and they seem to pop up for lots of reasons already. Maybe it\u2019s not impossible?"},{"author":"Billings","text":"If not impossible, then I\u2019d say, implausible."},{"author":"Moskowitz","text":"Well, I\u2019m forever an optimist, Lee!
