This time we\u2019re looking at whether you get more accurate results if you swab your throat as well as your nose. We\u2019ll also talk about possible new CDC guidelines about how long to isolate if you\u2019re positive. [Clip: Show theme music]"

      "text": ": It\u2019s February, and COVID levels are still quite high in the U.S. They\u2019re way above what the CDC describes as epidemic levels, which means a lot of people are sick. Including me, as it turns out. Though I may just have a bad cold."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Oh man, that\u2019s rough. It seems like I\u2019m constantly hearing about a friend or coworker testing positive for COVID. And that means a lot of people are taking home tests."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Last month, you and I talked about a frustrating wrinkle in those test results."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Yeah. People who got symptoms and tested right away were getting negative results\u2013even though they were actually infected. And that seems to be because your immune system is now familiar enough with the virus to react quickly and cause symptoms like a runny nose or stuffy nose. But the virus itself hasn\u2019t built up to high enough levels in your nose to trigger a positive test result. In other words, it\u2019s a false negative."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": If you wait a few days after symptoms start\u2013say, two to four days\u2013and then you test, you\u2019re more likely to get an accurate result. But that\u2019s frustrating, right? You know you\u2019re sick with something, and you don\u2019t want to pass COVID around. But until you know for sure, you stay home, or you keep your kids home from school. And then maybe it turns out to be a winter cold, or the flu."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": It\u2019s a good idea to stay home if you have any respiratory infection if you can, even if it\u2019s not COVID. Even the flu kills thousands of vulnerable people every year. Still, it would be nice to know if you could reduce those early false negatives with COVID tests, and find out if you actually do have the virus."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": That\u2019s why a lot of people are talking about swabbing your throat in addition to the nose. Two of our listeners, Ann and JD Stillwater of Pennsylvania, emailed us to ask how accurate throat swabbing is.\u00a0 There are a bunch of online videos touting that method now. [5 SEC AUDIO SAMPLE from U.K. public health video starting at 2:14: \u201cStand in front of a mirror. Wipe the soft tip around the back of the throat as shown.\u201d"

    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": I\u2019ve heard of that approach before - in fact I\u2019ve swabbed my own throat on several occasions, when I wanted to make extra sure I wasn\u2019t missing an infection. But it\u2019s a surefire way to gag. Is it actually more accurate?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": It could be. Some scientists believe that, early in an infection, the virus replicates more in the throat than in the nose. So you\u2019d be more likely to collect more virus.\u00a0When it comes to studies of accuracy, they\u2019ve mostly been on small numbers of people. And some of those studies say throats are more accurate. Others say they\u2019re not more accurate. Now, what seems to be one of the biggest, and one of the more carefully done studies on throat swabs was just published in December. So, we thought we\u2019d go straight to one of the researchers."

    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": That\u2019s an ear, nose and throat doctor to you and me. Todsen and his colleagues conducted a randomized trial, in Denmark, of about 2600 people. Some got nasal swabs, some got throat swabs, and some got both. And some of them used the swabs on themselves, while others had a health care worker collect the samples. The scientists confirmed the presence of the virus with a molecular test, like a PCR test, and that\u2019s the gold standard of accuracy here."
    },
    {
      "author": "Todsen",
      "text": ": We saw that there was a difference in when healthcare workers performed the test, and you did it yourself. So when the health care workers performed the test, then the throat was 9.4 percent better than the nasal swab\u2026.We didn't find any significant difference between the self collected swabs\u2026 comparing throat swabs with nasal swabs."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": So throat swabs were only more accurate when a health care worker did the swabbing. That makes sense. Speaking from personal experience, it\u2019s pretty hard to swab your own throat."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Yeah. And these are home tests, so going to a clinic to have a health care worker do one for you kind of defeats the purpose, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0But Todsen found something else that was pretty important. And that\u2019s got to do with combining nose and throat swabs in the same test."
    },
    {
      "author": "Todsen",
      "text": ": If home testing, if you combined\u2026 the nasal and the throat swabs, then you will\u2026 improve the sensitivity about 15 percent compared to nasal swabs alone. Meaning that combined swabs \u2026nasal and throat swabs will\u2026 decrease the risk of false negative results."

      "text": ": Wait. So he is saying that swabbing your throat only doesn\u2019t detect more infections, but swabbing both your nose and throat does?"
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Yeah, exactly. They used two separate swabs in the study, and then combined the samples. But since home test kits have single swabs, Todsen suggests using them this way:"
    },
    {
      "author": "Todsen: ",
      "text": "I would first make a throat swab on myself. And then I'll use the same stick for the nasal swab. And then I will handle this swab as you see in the instructions for the rapid antigen test you have bought."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": But those instructions, at least in all the U.S. home tests, say to swab the nose only. And besides, the FDA hasn\u2019t approved any tests involving throat swabbing."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Yeah. Look, Todsen thinks going both nose-and-throat will improve accuracy. Basically you\u2019re hitting more places so that improves the chances of grabbing some virus.\u00a0But it\u2019s a bit tricky in the U.S. First of all, the swabs in our kits are pretty short. You want to get them to the top of your throat, kind of at the roof of your mouth and past your teeth. But it\u2019s hard to reach that area unless you stick your fingers in your mouth, too."
    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": And that\u2019s even more likely to make you gag."
    },
    {
      "author": "Fischman",
      "text": ": Sure is. I tried it myself, just last night, because I have sniffles and a sore throat. But like you, I made some icky sounds. If you look at that U.K. Health Security video, their swabs are a lot longer and easier to get in and out.\u00a0And like you said, the U.S. tests aren\u2019t calibrated for accuracy using both nose and throat. So we don\u2019t really know how well they\u2019ll perform. Todsen\u2019s numbers say they\u2019ll lower the rate of false negatives, and some smaller studies back him up. But clearly here the science is moving faster than the manufacturing.\u00a0So I\u2019ll back up my combined swab with a nose-only tomorrow. Meanwhile I\u2019m staying home. Ann and JD from Pennsylvania, I know that\u2019s not a cut-and-dried answer, but for now it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got."

    },
    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Well, the CDC has just changed\u00a0 the COVID isolation period. A positive test doesn\u2019t automatically mean you need to stay home for five days anymore. The agency has shifted to letting symptoms be your guide. If you\u2019ve been free of fever for a full 24 hours, without the help of medication, and your symptoms are mild and improving, you don\u2019t need to stay home.\u00a0"

    {
      "author": "Lewis",
      "text": ": Yeah it is. Some people might say the guidelines are too lax\u2014you could still be infectious after your fever goes away, so it\u2019s not a perfect way to prevent all infections. But the CDC might be trying to give people guidance they\u2019re actually likely to follow\u2014and treat COVID more like the flu or other respiratory infections now that we have some immunity and protection against it.\u00a0 [CLIP: Show music]"
