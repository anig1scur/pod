Watching them graze among the oak and olive trees, you can almost pretend you\u2019re back in the Middle Ages, when members of Portugal\u2019s royal family lived part-time in the palaces of nearby Vila Real. A lot has changed since then. Portugal is one of the most vulnerable countries in Europe to climate change. Straddling the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic regions, it\u2019s part of\u00a0a climate change hot spot. According to several studies, this region is warming faster than much of the rest of the world. Some of the worst droughts, heat waves and wildfires have happened here. In June and October 2017 a total of 117 people died in central Portugal after extreme heat, dry conditions and strong winds sparked multiple megafires. [CLIP: music]"

      "text": "Here in northern Portugal, some of the biggest fuels are shrubs. One\u00a0study\u00a0found that shrubland covers 1.6 million hectares in Portugal\u2014about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s land area. And those shrubs are gaining ground. That\u2019s because, for decades, people have been moving out of rural communities such as the one Tommy Ferreira lives in. Most leave to pursue better-paying jobs in the cities or in wealthier European Union countries. Portugal has lost 30 percent of its rural population since 1960. The same trend is occurring across the Mediterranean region. Abandoning these farmlands is increasing wildfire risk, according to an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report released last spring. When people who work the land leave it, grazing pastures and farm fields become thick with fuels. But these ancient Maronesa cattle can help solve both of these modern-day problems. It was a solution hiding in plain sight. [CLIP: Music]\u00a0 [CLIP: Footsteps]"

      "text": ":\u00a0Tommy\u2019s farm is part of a three-year-old project funded in part by the E.U. under its climate adaptation program. The idea is to use the animals to make the land more resilient to climate change\u2014and create an incentive for shepherds to stick around. As people have abandoned pasturelands, and as a warming climate has delayed the first frost by a full month, shrubs have crowded out grasses. Luckily, unlike most cattle, Maronesas actually love eating shrubs."

      "text": "Carlos Aguiar is the science lead for the LIFE Maronesa project. We\u2019re standing on the mountainside above Tommy\u2019s farm. These are commonlands shared by Tommy and other shepherds. After years of grazing and an influx of calcium, magnesium and other nutrients, a mosaic of different types of grasses are reclaiming the mountainside. Carlos crouches down and runs his fingertips across a dense mat of kelly-green grass. He says that grazing keeps fuels at bay, and it also increases the amount of carbon stored in the soil. In recent history, shepherds typically kept their cattle or goats in pens in the village much of the time. Farmers would use the manure to fertilize crops. But with so little grazing on the commonlands, they were starved of nutrients."
