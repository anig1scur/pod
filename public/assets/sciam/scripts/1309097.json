And happy May. I hope the weather is pleasantly springy wherever you\u2019re listening from. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Let\u2019s kick off the month with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed last week."},{"author":"","text":"First, a crucial report on climate change is under threat. The National Climate Assessment, published by the federal government every few years since 2000, provides the most comprehensive look at how climate change is impacting the U.S. It looks at things like sea-level rise and wildfire smoke mitigation, as well as analyzes climate change\u2019s impacts on areas including health, farming and the economy. Private companies, nonprofits, and state and local governments use the information in the assessment to help navigate the effects of climate change."},{"author":"","text":"According to the Los Angeles Times, about 400 people were already at work on the next edition of the report, which is due in 2027 or 2028. Last Monday all of those volunteer authors were dismissed via an email that said \u201cthe scope of the [Sixth National Climate Assessment] is currently being reevaluated.\u201d This comes several weeks after the Trump administration cut funding and staffing for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversees the creation of the assessment."},{"author":"","text":"The release of the National Climate Assessment every four years is actually mandated by Congress. Under George W. Bush the report that should have come out in 2004 was released a few years late but it did come out. And that was thanks to a lawsuit led by environmental advocacy groups that forced the administration\u2019s hand. So it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to call up your representatives and ask them to make sure this congressionally mandated report isn\u2019t stymied, but it\u2019s also possible some of the entities that rely on the assessment will take legal action to save it."},{"author":"","text":"In space news Amazon launched its first round of Internet satellites into orbit last Monday. The 27 Project Kuiper satellites are intended to circle about 400 miles [about 630 kilometers] above the Earth\u2019s surface to provide broadband Internet coverage. Amazon reportedly plans to launch more than 3,200 of the small satellites into orbit, where they\u2019ll join the more than 7,000 SpaceX Starlink satellites already in the sky. Reports indicate that SpaceX aims to have as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit in the future."},{"author":"","text":"Back in late 2024 more than 100 astronomers signed an open letter asking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to halt the launch of further satellites of this kind, which collectively form networks often referred to as mega constellations. The scientists called for more investigation into how these mega constellations will impact the environment. In addition to creating more and more space debris\u2014which can damage other satellites and even spacecraft like the International Space Station\u2014mega constellations have the potential to interfere with astronomical observations. The satellites that make up these networks can also damage the ozone layer and pollute the planet when they fall back down to Earth, which happens after a few years of operation."},{"author":"","text":"Speaking of satellites, here\u2019s a riddle for you: how do you go about weighing a few trillion trees? With a giant space umbrella, apparently. Last Tuesday the European Space Agency launched its Biomass satellite, nicknamed the \u201cspace brolly,\u201d to study our planet\u2019s forests. An estimated 1.5 trillion trees in Earth\u2019s forests absorb around eight billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, but it\u2019s difficult to estimate exactly how much carbon is getting stored\u2014especially as forests are damaged and destroyed by human activities. The Biomass satellite will use a special type of radar to see through forest canopies and measure the woody material that stores most of the carbon."},{"author":"","text":"Farther out in space, new data from NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft offers insights into the extreme environment of Jupiter and its moon Io. One of the most exciting findings focuses on Jupiter\u2019s giant cyclones. While hurricanes on our planet typically pop up one by one\u2014and tend to stay at lower latitudes\u2014Jupiter has a consistent cluster of cyclones around its poles. One is quite close to the north pole itself, and another eight circle around it. After years of observing these cyclones scientists say they\u2019ve seen the storms slowly drift toward the pole\u2014but then bounce off one another when they get close. That could help explain why this set of storms is so stable."},{"author":"","text":"Juno also provided an update on Io\u2019s volcanic activity. This Jovian moon is constantly squeezed by the massive planet\u2019s gravitational pull, which creates enough friction to melt parts of Io\u2019s interior. That means Io has pretty much constant volcanic activity."},{"author":"","text":"In December Juno spotted a massive new volcanic hotspot in Io\u2019s southern hemisphere. Scientists estimated that the hotspot was nearly a third larger than Lake Superior and was spewing six times as much energy as all of Earth\u2019s power plants combined."},{"author":"","text":"According to the latest Juno data, that eruption was still spitting out ash and lava as of March 2. Scientists hope to observe it again during another close flyby on May 6."},{"author":"","text":"We\u2019ll end with a fun story\u2014or maybe kind of a bummer of a debunking, depending on your perspective."},{"author":"","text":"You may have seen some news stories last week claiming that lab-grown Tyrannosaurus rex leather could soon be used to craft wallets and purses. Those headlines stemmed from a press release issued by VML, a communications and marketing agency, in partnership with biotech companies Lab-Grown Leather Ltd. and the Organoid Company. The press release claims that together these companies will use fossilized T. rex collagen to engineer cells with synthetic DNA that mimic those found in dinosaur skin."},{"author":"","text":"Can you guess where this is going? I bet you can. Two different experts told Live Science that the notion is misleading at best. Thomas Carr, director of the Carthage Institute of Paleontology in Wisconsin, told Live Science that scientists have an incomplete understanding of T. rex collagen because all the fossilized evidence we have of its amino acids are fragmented. He also pointed out that collagen is a pretty generic molecule across species, so even having a good sense of what T. rex collagen looked like at the cellular level wouldn\u2019t necessarily help you create distinctly T. rex-esque skin. So yeah, whether you\u2019re reading about mammoth mice, dire wolf puppies or dinosaur wallets, if you see someone promising to resurrect a prehistoric creature using the powers of genetic engineering, you should probably be pretty skeptical. And I promise if that changes, you will hear it here first."},{"author":"","text":"That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup. We\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to explore the benefits of strength training."},{"author":"","text":"While I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve got just a quick favor: We\u2019re running a listener survey to find out what people like about Science Quickly and what we might be able to improve.

Monday, listeners! And happy May. I hope the weather is pleasantly springy wherever you\u2019re listening from. For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. Let\u2019s kick off the month with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed last week."]},{"begin":"21.400","end":"76.520","lines":["First, a crucial report on climate change is under threat. The National Climate Assessment, published by the federal government every few years since 2000, provides the most comprehensive look at how climate change is impacting the U.S. It looks at things like sea-level rise and wildfire smoke mitigation, as well as analyzes climate change\u2019s impacts on areas including health, farming and the economy. Private companies, nonprofits, and state and local governments use the information in the assessment to help navigate the effects of climate change."]},{"begin":"76.520","end":"116.280","lines":["According to the Los Angeles Times, about 400 people were already at work on the next edition of the report, which is due in 2027 or 2028. Last Monday all of those volunteer authors were dismissed via an email that said \u201cthe scope of the [Sixth National Climate Assessment] is currently being reevaluated.\u201d This comes several weeks after the Trump administration cut funding and staffing for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversees the creation of the assessment."]},{"begin":"116.280","end":"165.600","lines":["The release of the National Climate Assessment every four years is actually mandated by Congress. Under George W. Bush the report that should have come out in 2004 was released a few years late but it did come out. And that was thanks to a lawsuit led by environmental advocacy groups that forced the administration\u2019s hand. So it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to call up your representatives and ask them to make sure this congressionally mandated report isn\u2019t stymied, but it\u2019s also possible some of the entities that rely on the assessment will take legal action to save it."]},{"begin":"165.600","end":"209.440","lines":["In space news Amazon launched its first round of Internet satellites into orbit last Monday. The 27 Project Kuiper satellites are intended to circle about 400 miles [about 630 kilometers] above the Earth\u2019s surface to provide broadband Internet coverage. Amazon reportedly plans to launch more than 3,200 of the small satellites into orbit, where they\u2019ll join the more than 7,000 SpaceX Starlink satellites already in the sky. Reports indicate that SpaceX aims to have as many as 42,000 satellites in orbit in the future."]},{"begin":"209.440","end":"251.760","lines":["Back in late 2024 more than 100 astronomers signed an open letter asking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to halt the launch of further satellites of this kind, which collectively form networks often referred to as mega constellations. The scientists called for more investigation into how these mega constellations will impact the environment. In addition to creating more and more space debris\u2014which can damage other satellites and even spacecraft like the International Space Station\u2014mega constellations have the potential to interfere with astronomical observations. The satellites that make up these networks can also damage the ozone layer and pollute the planet when they fall back down to Earth, which happens after a few years of operation."]},{"begin":"251.760","end":"292.320","lines":["Speaking of satellites, here\u2019s a riddle for you: how do you go about weighing a few trillion trees? With a giant space umbrella, apparently. Last Tuesday the European Space Agency launched its Biomass satellite, nicknamed the \u201cspace brolly,\u201d to study our planet\u2019s forests. An estimated 1.5 trillion trees in Earth\u2019s forests absorb around eight billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, but it\u2019s difficult to estimate exactly how much carbon is getting stored\u2014especially as forests are damaged and destroyed by human activities. The Biomass satellite will use a special type of radar to see through forest canopies and measure the woody material that stores most of the carbon."]},{"begin":"292.320","end":"331.200","lines":["Farther out in space, new data from NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft offers insights into the extreme environment of Jupiter and its moon Io. One of the most exciting findings focuses on Jupiter\u2019s giant cyclones. While hurricanes on our planet typically pop up one by one\u2014and tend to stay at lower latitudes\u2014Jupiter has a consistent cluster of cyclones around its poles. One is quite close to the north pole itself, and another eight circle around it. After years of observing these cyclones scientists say they\u2019ve seen the storms slowly drift toward the pole\u2014but then bounce off one another when they get close. That could help explain why this set of storms is so stable."]},{"begin":"331.200","end":"347.320","lines":["Juno also provided an update on Io\u2019s volcanic activity. This Jovian moon is constantly squeezed by the massive planet\u2019s gravitational pull, which creates enough friction to melt parts of Io\u2019s interior. That means Io has pretty much constant volcanic activity."]},{"begin":"347.320","end":"363.160","lines":["In December Juno spotted a massive new volcanic hotspot in Io\u2019s southern hemisphere. Scientists estimated that the hotspot was nearly a third larger than Lake Superior and was spewing six times as much energy as all of Earth\u2019s power plants combined."]},{"begin":"363.160","end":"373.680","lines":["According to the latest Juno data, that eruption was still spitting out ash and lava as of March 2. Scientists hope to observe it again during another close flyby on May 6."]},{"begin":"373.680","end":"379.480","lines":["We\u2019ll end with a fun story\u2014or maybe kind of a bummer of a debunking, depending on your perspective."]},{"begin":"379.480","end":"408.120","lines":["You may have seen some news stories last week claiming that lab-grown Tyrannosaurus rex leather could soon be used to craft wallets and purses. Those headlines stemmed from a press release issued by VML, a communications and marketing agency, in partnership with biotech companies Lab-Grown Leather Ltd. and the Organoid Company. The press release claims that together these companies will use fossilized T. rex collagen to engineer cells with synthetic DNA that mimic those found in dinosaur skin."]},{"begin":"408.120","end":"461.520","lines":["Can you guess where this is going? I bet you can. Two different experts told Live Science that the notion is misleading at best. Thomas Carr, director of the Carthage Institute of Paleontology in Wisconsin, told Live Science that scientists have an incomplete understanding of T. rex collagen because all the fossilized evidence we have of its amino acids are fragmented. He also pointed out that collagen is a pretty generic molecule across species, so even having a good sense of what T. rex collagen looked like at the cellular level wouldn\u2019t necessarily help you create distinctly T. rex-esque skin. So yeah, whether you\u2019re reading about mammoth mice, dire wolf puppies or dinosaur wallets, if you see someone promising to resurrect a prehistoric creature using the powers of genetic engineering, you should probably be pretty skeptical. And I promise if that changes, you will hear it here first."]},{"begin":"461.520","end":"467.040","lines":["That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s news roundup.
