      "text": ": The history of the removal of fire from California is at least coastal landscapes began pretty early on with early Spanish settlement. When we think about some of the first policies within the state, that limited the extent of where indigenous people could engage with fire, that policy initially came out around 1793 from a proclamation from the Spanish governor of California that forbid indigenous people from using fire. And so, you know, that spread from mission Santa Barbara outward.\u00a0"

We need to burn, or we're getting too much litter accumulation and on the forest floor. With this policy in place, people were limited in being able to burn because there were really strict penalties applied to people who, who set fires."

I think there was something like 11,000 of them that quickly started fires everywhere around the mountains. You could see these massive smoke columns. We had a wind pickup out of the Northwest and it took the three fires that were burning all around Big Basin, and it just pushed. It just pushed the fire right through the park.\u00a0"

Our normal weather pattern was back. So that marine influence that brings cool moist air from the ocean is now keeping the fire relatively mild."
