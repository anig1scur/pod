It\u2019s green. It is not the business capital of anything. It\u2019s not a place anyone associates with cutting-edge economic research. But there is a research forest here, where scientists study the economic dynamics of forest ecosystems. And at the edge of the forest, there\u2019s a little greenhouse on a hill. [CLIP: Footsteps]"},{"author":"Duff","text":"This is where I came to learn about the surprising economic actors in a hidden economy that we are still just beginning to understand. This economy is being reshaped by climate change \u2026 and without it, we might not even be alive. My name is Meg Duff, and you\u2019re listening to Science, Quickly. [CLIP: Intro music]"},{"author":"Jenny Bhatnagar: ","text":"These are saplings, oak saplings, and we\u2019re planting them in pots. We\u2019re doing a big greenhouse experiment."},{"author":"Duff","text":"That\u2019s Jenny Bhatnagar, an associate professor of biology at Boston University. She and her colleagues are in the Harvard Forest greenhouse setting up an experiment to study an underground economy. And when I say underground I do mean that literally, because under our feet, plants and fungi are constantly trading."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"Oh, the trees provide the fungus with sugar. And in exchange, the fungus provides the tree with nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, sulfate, water, etcetera."},{"author":"Duff","text":"A fungus is like a mullet. As Jenny put it, there\u2019s a business end and a party end."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"The mushroom is the party end.... It only makes a mushroom when the conditions are right."},{"author":"Duff","text":"But I\u2019m here to see the business end: these tiny underground threads that run throughout the soil, collecting nutrients."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"So I\u2019m opening up a cooler.... So this is a cooler full of soil.... And look, see all that white?"},{"author":"Duff (tape)","text":"Wait, that little ..."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"That white is fungus. It\u2019s not plastic."},{"author":"Duff (tape)","text":"It looks like plastic!"},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"It\u2019s not. And you can see they grow on the tips of the roots. See, right there..., see this yellow? That\u2019s an ectomycorrhizal fungus that\u2019s colonizing the roots of the oaks."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Mycorrhizae are these long threadlike fungi that connect to the roots of plants. This network is often called the \u201cwood wide web\u201d because it facilitates communication in the forest. But there is also an economic relationship between plants and these fungi: During photosynthesis, plants collect carbon from the atmosphere. And some of it, they trade it to fungi."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"Tree roots are not very good at getting nutrients and water for themselves."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Because of that, many trees trade with fungi to get resources they can\u2019t otherwise reach. Jenny says that if they don\u2019t have as many fungi to trade with, trees don\u2019t do as well: they\u2019re often smaller, less resilient to stress and less likely to survive. So the experiment Jenny\u2019s working on is about trying to get more mycorrhizal fungi into urban soil. Yeah."},{"author":"Duff (tape)","text":"So then these little sidewalk trees ..."},{"author":"Bhatnagar","text":"They don\u2019t have a lot..., and so we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know how the trees are able to live in the city.... We think they grow fast..., but then they die young."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Because they don\u2019t have as many fungi to trade with, city trees live more of a subsistence lifestyle. Forest trees just have more resources. Or\u2014they have had, for most of the time forests have existed. But recently, their \u201ceconomy\u201d has been changing, too. And unfortunately, it\u2019s been changing in ways that will probably feel really familiar\u2014because trees, like us,\u00a0 have been experiencing inflation. [CLIP: Music]"},{"author":"Renato Braghiere: ","text":"The fungi are interested in the carbon that plants produce, and the plants will pay out this carbon to the fungi, and in turn, the fungi will mobilize, searching for nutrients, and return these nutrients to the plants."},{"author":"Duff","text":"To learn more, I called up Renato Braghiere, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who has been modeling the plant-fungi economy."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"It\u2019s a win-win situation.... We can see carbon as this currency that plants use to benefit from fungi ..."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Except for one thing: For the past few hundred years, humans have been burning fossil fuels\u2014filling the air with more carbon for plants to capture. But the fungi don\u2019t always have more nutrients to trade."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"Eventually the fungi will scavenge soil looking for nutrients, and they will just find it\u2019s harder to gather the same amount of nutrients that the plants are requiring."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Since the supply of nutrients can\u2019t keep up with demand, fungi are raising their prices. And even though plants have more carbon to spend, it\u2019s just not going as far."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"We\u2019re kind of causing this inflation into this trade that has been working for so many years."},{"author":"Duff","text":"You heard that right. Like us, plants are experiencing inflation. For a few million years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were pretty stable. But since the industrial revolution\u2014and especially in the past few decades\u2014humans have added lots more, essentially devaluing the plants\u2019 currency. To oversimplify, there are really two options for what happens next. Just as in the human world, the plant economy could course correct or it could crash. Obviously, the crash scenario is not great for the plants."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"Because they don\u2019t have nutrients, the photosynthetic rates will decrease."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Like Jenny\u2019s street trees, forest trees may begin to grow more slowly, reproduce less often and then die young. That\u2019s also bad for the fungi because they get less carbon. And it\u2019s really bad for us, too, because we benefit when forests store carbon."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"So one third of ... the atmospheric CO2 that we put up there gets absorbed by the land. And if the system crashes, this, this fraction, third, can go down."},{"author":"Duff","text":"By absorbing our carbon dioxide, plants and fungi have actually been helping to slow global warming. That\u2019s why planting trees is such a popular climate solution. To use an economic term, the land sink for carbon is one of the things we factor into our global \u201ccarbon budget\u201d\u2014which helps us decide how much carbon we can burn without overshooting climate goals. And Renato says that if it weren\u2019t for this inconvenient problem of inflation ..."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"We would have plants assimilating more and more and more carbon forever, and we will just see a very, very strong sink of carbon in the land surface."},{"author":"Duff","text":"But, he says, that\u2019s probably not what we should expect. Nutrient limits, along with other challenges, like droughts and fires, paint a different picture."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"From the end of the century on, it seems like projections are saying that this productivity will start to decrease. And eventually... the land can turn into a carbon source instead of a carbon sink. And then the feedback into the climate system will just amplify and accelerate climate change, which will be a disaster."},{"author":"Duff","text":"So that\u2019s what the models say right now. But there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"Like, inflation in economics is really hard to predict.... The future is uncertain for mainly two different reasons. There\u2019s the uncertainty in the processes that we represent in these models. But there\u2019s also the uncertainty in the pathways that humans will take. So we might cut emissions by 2030, and then the climate system would take other pathways."},{"author":"Duff","text":"If humans keep burning fossil fuels and printing more money for the plants, we are making the \u201ccrash\u201d scenario a lot more likely. But we still don\u2019t know how the plants and the fungi will respond."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"Yes, we\u2019re expecting that the system will crash.... It\u2019s also important to say that nature has this incredible capacity to adapt."},{"author":"Duff","text":"There are a few different scenarios that could play out. Among the millions of species of fungi, there may be winners and losers. But some may actually do really well with different carbon prices. Best case scenario, those fungi help forests adapt."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"Because now the price of carbon nutrient is different, one species of fungi can benefit from a different price.... We might see a shift in the composition of different types of fungi that associate with different types of plants."},{"author":"Duff","text":"But those changes may not come quickly enough. And if those plant fungi partnerships change, that could also change these economies in other ways too ..."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"That could have a cascading effect to the entire biodiversity of that ecosystem as well."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Here\u2019s the annoying thing, though: it\u2019s really hard to get good data on underground economies. And that\u2019s even more true when the economy is actually underground\u2014when it\u2019s all happening under a layer of dirt. Right now Renato is extrapolating from a few research forests, like the one I visited. The problem: these forests are mostly near well-funded universities in the U.S. and Europe. So tropical rainforests are underrepresented."},{"author":"Braghiere","text":"So, at the moment, we set one carbon nutrient price per mycorrhizal type all across the world, but we might just end up with extra data realizing that ... in one part of the globe, the symbiotic relationship has a different cost than other parts of the globe."},{"author":"Duff","text":"Right now Renato\u2019s models use some very back-of-the-envelope assumptions about what\u2019s going on under the soil. And he thinks a crash is by far the most likely scenario. But to be certain, we need better data on which fungi are where and how their relationships are shifting. In the next episode, we\u2019ll explore how researchers are getting those data. Because, as it turns out, they are in fact mapping these nearly invisible underground fungi. Here\u2019s the wild part: now, they\u2019re figuring out how to do that from space.
