If you feel like this is happening, you\u2019re probably having a cluster headache. Only about one in 1,000 people experience such headaches, but for those that do, they\u2019re excruciating. Now imagine that you took a psychedelic drug, and all of a sudden your brain-splitting headaches went away. You\u2019d definitely want to investigate that, right?

So we were sitting there and, you know, we were talking with them about conducting a study about LSD. But what happened is that there was a certain pause in the conversation.

Leary was dismissed from his position in the early 1960s for controversial experiments with psychedelics\u2014including giving them to undergraduates\u2014so the Harvard administrators weren\u2019t exactly excited about the prospect of another research group dosing people on campus with LSD. In fact, they wanted Torsten and his colleagues to steer away from using anything psychedelic at all. But Torsten was sure the psychedelic part of LSD was critical for treating cluster headaches, so he proposed a study that he thought would show the Harvard administrators he was right.\u00a0"

Some labs have shifted their entire focus to investigating whether psychedelic drugs sans trip and sans accompanying therapy could be used for all sorts of applications, including things that typically can\u2019t just be cured by popping a pill such as post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and addiction. But is the trip necessary for healing, or is it just a distraction? This is a heated question that\u2019s currently dividing the field. Torsten, for his part, thinks it\u2019s a waste of time to try to use tripless psychedelics to try to treat any kind of neuropsychiatric condition."

We\u2019re talking about a billion people worldwide. That is a huge problem. And if we ever hope to address a problem of that magnitude fully, we\u2019re going to need medicines that are very scalable. And right now psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is not a very scalable option because of the cost and the complexity of the treatment. If we don\u2019t try to decouple the beneficial effects from the hallucinogenic effects, a very small number of patients will benefit from psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy."

      "author": "Nuwer: ",
      "text": "In case you don\u2019t know,psychedelic-assisted therapy is a very involved process. It involves giving someone a psychedelic drug such as MDMA or psilocybin and then having them undergo hours of guided therapy with one or two specially trained therapists. There are also prep sessions with the therapists beforehand and integration sessions after to help people make sense of the experience and apply the lessons or revelations they gained to their sober life.\u00a0 In a way, these sessions are learning exercises: people are learning to think and react in new ways. The question, though, is whether the active learning part of psychedelic therapy can be bypassed partially or completely but still produce positive results. David is betting that it can \u2014 based on one of the things he says psychedelics do in the brain."

      "text": "They promote structural plasticity in the part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Now, the prefrontal cortex is really critical for diseases like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder, because it\u2019s a brain region that talks to a whole bunch of other brain regions that regulate fear, motivation and reward. In many of these stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases, there\u2019s physical changes in the structure of the brain, including the atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. And if you can regrow these atrophied neurons, you can reestablish synaptic connectivity and allow the PFC to talk to the other brain regions that it needs to talk to and then ameliorate disease symptoms. Now, something that\u2019s very unique about molecules like ketamine and psychedelics is that they are very good at promoting the growth of these neurons rapidly\u2014within 24 hours ... And also that their effects last long after the drugs have been cleared from the body."

And the fact is, is that there are drugs like that\u2014psychoactive plastogens\u2014and all of the ones that we know that do that are addictive drugs like cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, alcohol, nicotine. These are all robust inducers of plasticity."

That\u2019s because the combination of trip and drug promotes learning, and it\u2019s this learning, they think, that\u2019s key to achieving the long-lasting results seen in some clinical trials with psychedelics."

Afterward the rodents\u2019 brain returned to an open state of learning as though they were a juvenile mouse. On the other hand, when the mice were given cocaine\u2014a psychoactive drug that increases general plasticity but is not a psychedelic\u2014their critical period did not reopen. The mice\u2019s critical period also did not reopen when they weren\u2019t put through the learning exercise, even if they were on a psychedelic.\u00a0 These findings suggest that it\u2019s not just the psychedelics that are contributing to targeted changes in the brain but also what someone does while on the drugs.\u00a0"
