It\u2019s given rise to the recent court rulings that attempt to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone. [Clip: Show theme music]"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"April was a busy month for the fight to roll back reproductive rights. First, a district judge in Texas issued a ruling that would\u2019ve removed the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. It\u2019s used in more than half of abortions in the U.S., and it\u2019s also used for miscarriage treatment. The Supreme Court has blocked the ruling for now. [Clip: ABC 7 Chicago news report]"},{"author":"Reporter","text":"Mifepristone, known as the abortion pill, gets a temporary lifeline from the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices need more time to weigh in on whether the drug should remain widely available or roll back restrictions placed on Mifepristone when it was approved more than 20 years ago. In the district court case, Trump-appointed judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled in favor of anti-abortion activists and doctors, who argued that the Food and Drug Administration did not adequately address the safety risks when it approved the drug more than 20 years ago."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"But that\u2019s not true, is it? I\u2019ve seen dozens of studies about the pill\u2019s safety."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Right - a wealth of research shows it is extremely safe and effective\u2014studies show that more than 99 percent of patients who take abortion pills have no serious complications."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Just a few hours after the Texas ruling, Thomas Rice, a district judge in Washington State appointed by Barack Obama, issued a competing ruling. That one ordered the FDA to do nothing to restrict mifepristone access where abortion is currently legal. And that includes 17 states and Washington, D.C."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The Department of Justice and Danco Laboratories, the company that manufactures mifepristone, appealed the Texas decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court issued a stay on the ruling until the case could be fully heard, but imposed certain restrictions on the drug that had been in place before 2016."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Restrictions like what?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Like banning people from sending mifepristone by mail\u2014but more on that in a sec. So after all this back-and-forth, the Supreme Court weighed in on April 21. It issued a hold on both the Texas and Fifth Circuit rulings, restoring full access to mifepristone while the Fifth Circuit appeal proceeds later this month. And that\u2019s where things stand now."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"I\u2019m having trouble following the legal logic of all this.\u00a0 What was the original Texas ruling based on? We already talked about mifepristone\u2019s good safety record, and medication abortion has been legal for decades."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s a great question. The plaintiffs in the Texas case argued that mifepristone\u2014which is part of a two-drug regimen along with the drug misoprostol\u2014could cause serious complications in people who took it. But dozens of studies have shown that the drug combo causes fewer side effects than many other FDA-approved medications, including Tylenol and Viagra.\u00a0"},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Interesting that the Texas doctors were more concerned about mifepristone than Viagra. But okay, the abortion pill is quite safe. What about the Fifth Circuit ruling that said that mifepristone shouldn\u2019t be sent by mail? Where did that come from?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I\u2019m glad you asked. Both the Fifth Circuit ruling and the original Texas decision cited a law from 1873 called the Comstock Act, which forbids the mailing of \u201cobscene, lewd or lascivious\u201d materials."},{"author":"Annalee Newitz: ","text":"It's named after a guy named Anthony Comstock, who was a very famous moral crusader based in New York in the mid-19th century. His career started mostly because he was interested in stamping out obscenity."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"That\u2019s Annalee Newitz, an author and science journalist. They wrote a sci-fi novel called \u201cThe Future of Another Timeline.\u201d It\u2019s about a group of feminists who travel back in time to stop Comstock\u2019s misogynistic anti-obscenity crusade. For a recent story on Sciam.com, I spoke with Newitz about Comstock, and how his law is still being used to restrict reproductive rights."},{"author":"Newitz","text":"It just forbids the sending of obscene materials through the mail \u2026 of course, he was targeting very specific people, people who were known to be selling the raw material, but also more importantly, people who were selling any kind of information that was sex education related, not obscene, like just literally things like \u2018here's how to make a baby\u2019 for people who are getting married, and also information about birth control and abortion."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The law was based on the first amendment\u2019s exception for obscenity, which is not protected as free speech. Of course, keep in mind that the definition of obscenity back then was pretty vague. It included anything related to reproductive health, abortion or sex education. Congress actually created a new position for Comstock as a special agent of the U.S. postal service, where he had the power to arrest people for obscenity violations."},{"author":"Newitz","text":"He\u00a0also had kind of an army of deputized suppressors of vice, this organization called the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which just sounds like something out of, like, a Marvel comic. They would figure out who was, you know, an abortion provider and break in."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"AndComstock and his deputies were pretty brutal."},{"author":"Newitz","text":"they would know that the person was in the midst of doing an abortion, they would break into their house during the abortion and drag them to the police station like, bleeding, and leave them on the floor to make a point."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"They really did that? That\u2019s just terrifying. And dangerous! A patient could die."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Absolutely. It was pretty barbaric. Comstock also went after art and literature that he considered obscene."},{"author":"Newitz","text":"Comstock tried to shut down the Chicago World's Fair, because they were putting belly dancers out as one of the many, many acts that you could go see, and he thought belly dancing was obscene."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"In 1905, Playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote an op-ed in the New York Times making fun of America\u2019s \u201cComstockery\u201d\u2014a term he used to refer to its censorious attitude toward art and literature."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Shaw was actually firing back at a public library that put his plays on a restricted reading list. \u201cComstockery,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the world\u2019s standing joke.\u201d \u201cIf I had the misfortune to be a citizen of the United States I should probably have my property confiscated by some postal official, and be myself imprisoned.\u201d Comstockery is a great term. I\u2019m going to start using it."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"I know, right? But even though Comstock himself became kind of a joke, the act and similar laws enacted by states stayed on the books. In the 1960s and 70s, the Supreme Court issued several key rulings that restricted the definition of obscenity. As Justice Potter Stewart famously said in the 1964 case Jacobellis v. Ohio, when asked to define obscenity\u2026 [Clip: Justice Potter Stewart]"},{"author":"Stewart","text":"I know it when I see it."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"And in 1973, you had Roe v. Wade, which basically said abortion is legal because of a constitutional right to privacy, not because abortion itself was protected."},{"author":"Newitz","text":"Pretty much every lawyer I've heard talk about this\u2026who's, you know, sort of knowledgeable about reproductive rights is like, \u201cWhy the hell did we do that?\u201d That was such a precarious ruling\u2014so easy to roll back."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"And that\u2019s exactly what happened when the Dobbs decision came last summer.\u00a0 That one overturned Roe v. Wade, paving the way for many states to ban or severely restrict abortion."},{"author":"Lewis","text":"Exactly. And all this time, we never actually repealed the provisions of the Comstock Act having to do with sending abortion medication by mail. So the Texas mifepristone ruling and the Fifth Circuit stay have used the law as justification for attempting to restrict the abortion pill\u2019s distribution."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"So what happens next?"},{"author":"Lewis","text":"The Fifth Circuit Appeals Court has scheduled a hearing for May 17. But the case is almost certainly headed back to the Supreme Court, where justices will likely have to wrestle with the legacy of Comstock yet again."},{"author":"Fischman","text":"Well, I guess we\u2019ll see if Comstockery holds up in the 21st century.
