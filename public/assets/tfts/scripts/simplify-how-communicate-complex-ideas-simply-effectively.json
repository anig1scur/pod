{"title":"Simplify! How to Communicate Complex Ideas Simply and Effectively","url":"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/simplify-how-communicate-complex-ideas-simply-effectively","intro":["You said it. But did they hear it? For Frances Frei, communication is about saying things simply enough for an audience to truly understand.","As a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, Frei knows that shaping culture within organizations requires communicating in ways that influence how people think and act. The problem for many leaders, she says, is that when we \u201cunderstand something deeply, we describe it in a complicated way. If you want broad influence and persuasion, we have to understand it really deeply. And then describe it in a simple and compelling enough way that others can take action.\u201d","In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Frei and host Matt Abrahams explore strategies for simpler communication, building and maintaining trust, and celebrating diverse perspectives within our teams. They also discuss takeaways from Frei's latest book, Move Fast and Fix Things: The Trusted Leaders' Guide to Solving Hard Problems."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"When it comes to change and persuasion, we must think deeply, but communicate simply. Welcome to Think Fast, talk Smart, the podcast. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Today I am super excited to be joined by Francis Frei, who is Professor of Technology and Operations Management at Harvard Business School. Francis served as Uber\u2019s Senior Vice President of Leadership and Strategy, along with Anne Morriss. Francis hosts the Fixable podcast. And together, Anne and Francis wrote Unleashed: The Unapologetic Leader\u2019s Guide to Empowering Everyone Around You and their new book, Move Fast and Fix Things: The Trusted Leader\u2019s Guide to Solving Hard Problems. Welcome, Francis. I have enjoyed getting to know you over the last few years and I look so forward to our conversation today."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Oh, I\u2019m so thrilled to be here, Matt. Thank you for inviting me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. So let\u2019s get started. You study and advocate for the value and importance of trust in leadership. Can you share some strategies and tactics leaders can use to build and support trust?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Yeah, so the first thing is to realize that many of the sayings we hear are not true. So it takes a long time to build. You lose it in an instant, it can never be rebuilt. None of those statements are true. My first strategic advice is treat trust like you treat everything else you want to build, understand it\u2019s component parts, build it up. If something happens and it gets wobbly, go back in and shore up the part that got wobbly. You don\u2019t have to shore up the rest of it, just the part that got wobbly. So treat it as something that you build and let go of all of the myths around it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it sounds to me like we need to think of trust as something that\u2019s ongoing, that we\u2019re constantly monitoring and measuring and making sure that it\u2019s the level we wish it to be, and if not, we dive right in and fix it. Is that right?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"I would say is that when you are earning trust, you can think about other things and anytime you have skeptics of one source or another, treat that with precision and urgency to go in and shore up what was in the place and then get it back up to humming along and then I think you don\u2019t have to worry about it quite as much anymore."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. And you talked about the different components, so I\u2019d love for you to describe for us your trust triangle, what it is and how we can use it. And I want to follow up on what you just said as well. When you notice that trust is weaker than you want it, what are some of the things you can do to dive in and work on it?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Terrific. Essentially the component parts are authenticity, logic and empathy. And what that means is that I am more likely to earn your trust. You are more likely to trust me if you simultaneously experience my authenticity, my logic, and my empathy. If you are blocked from experiencing any one of those three, you\u2019re not going to trust me. That\u2019s when we say it gets wobbly. That\u2019s when we have skeptics. We\u2019re trusted most of the time. So authenticity, logic and empathy are cooking, they\u2019re going, but every single time trust breaks down between individuals, between any stakeholders, between organizations. Anytime it breaks down, we have always been able to trace it back to one of these three and then we get to go get to work on which one it is because you\u2019ll find that the prescriptions are very different for the three of them. So we really have to get that matching right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s really helpful to have that rubric or key available. And it strikes me, Francis, that reflection is really important in this. A lot of us, myself included, when I feel trust is at risk, I get frustrated and I feel like I\u2019m doing everything I should. Why don\u2019t these people trust me? It sounds like I have to take a step back and really reflect on what\u2019s happening, look at the three that you\u2019ve mentioned and then try to figure out where it is so I can at least make some adjustments."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Yeah, I\u2019d say, Matt, you gave away a little bit of a tell that you might have an empathy wobble. I\u2019m doing everything right. Why don\u2019t they trust me? That\u2019s a pretty classic empathy wobble. Here\u2019s what I would say. I wonder what it is about my communication that\u2019s getting in the way of them. See how I just flipped it back? Because when people say we have to be self-reflected, I don\u2019t always know how to do it, but I know how to do what I just did with you, which is get curiosity from the other person\u2019s perspective."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love it. Thank you. Not only have you helped me, but you\u2019ve demonstrated what we can all do for ourselves and for others, and thank you critically important to take the time to reflect and then to think about how you can reverse the situation to help give the insight that you need. Many of those listening work for organizations that are in various stages of implementing de and i, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Based on your experience, what are some of the best ways to implement, assess and reinforce de and I programs?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"So we have found that the best way is to think about the letters d, e, and I and change the sequence. So the most important of these three letters is I, it\u2019s inclusion. It\u2019s the one that should be done first when we get inclusion, right? Diversity and equity often follow, but many times I see organizations get diversity, right and equity and inclusion may or may not follow. So I think the first thing is to realize that the focus should be on inclusion and now we have a very specific understanding of how to accelerate inclusion in any organization, but the crisp answer to the question is focus on inclusion and you\u2019re going to go at a much faster pace and get to a much higher place."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great. I love the idea of starting with inclusion. Can you give a little more detail into the specifics of what inclusion looks like? Are there stages and steps we can pay attention to?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Yes, indeed. So there\u2019s four stages of it and the stages are safe, welcome, celebrated, championed. The way to think about it is that each of us brings magnificent difference to the table. You\u2019re at Stanford, I\u2019m at Harvard, and then we could then list another 20 differences between us and they\u2019re magnificent. The way to think about inclusion is that despite any difference that we\u2019re bringing to the table, we have to set the condition so that each of us feels safe. Once we\u2019ve achieved safety and only once we\u2019ve achieved safety, we graduate to welcome, which is a lighter and lovelier thing that happened. But don\u2019t worry about welcome if you don\u2019t have safety. Once we have achieved safe and welcome, then we want to start celebrating one another for our uniqueness. And I think this is the part that matters instinctually, we often dwell on what we have in common."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"We look for the common ground and that sounds so good. The problem is the more difference we have, the less common we have, and everything that you and I have in common is a little redundant. I want to know how do you think about the world differently than how I think about the world? That\u2019s when we are both collectively going to be better off. So we want to learn the practice of celebrating uniqueness and we want to celebrate uniqueness in one another\u2019s presence, but also in one another\u2019s absence. And we champion people when I am invited into a room, for example, that maybe others aren\u2019t invited into and I speak on their behalf, I\u2019m championing them. And so it goes safe, welcome, celebrated, champion. And that\u2019s what we talk about is how do we move people up the inclusion dial without moving anyone else down the inclusion dial? And that\u2019s if I\u2019d say in 2023 when there\u2019s a lot of controversy around d e, I think much of it can be found in that concept. We\u2019re afraid of moving some people up at the expense of moving others down, and so we have to be clever in how we do this."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really appreciate that articulation of the different steps. It really helped me to focus on the different strategies and communication approaches I would take depending on where we are. What I do to build a sense of safety is very different than what I do when I\u2019m celebrating. I"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Love that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think it\u2019s important for us to realize that it\u2019s a whole toolkit we need. It\u2019s not just one big approach. I want to turn our attention to your new book, move Fast and Fix Things. You and Anne, your co-author and co-host on your podcast and wife strive to accelerate excellence in organizations by helping them, as you say, build and learn quickly while also avoiding costly mistakes. You do this essentially by providing a playbook for how to fix things fast. And you represent this methodology based on a weekday calendar. Can you walk us through the five steps in your playbook? Essentially walk us through Monday through Friday."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"We\u2019ve organized the book by days of the week. Monday, identify your real problem. We\u2019re often presented with the symptoms, but we got to trace back to what the real underlying cause is. So it\u2019s identification day, Tuesday, whatever your problem is. If it involves human beings, trust is broken. Rebuild trust at the center of your problem Wednesday when you\u2019re looking for how to do all the other things you have to do in addition to rebuilding trust, well, you want to go out and get as many gorgeous new perspectives as you can. So we call it make new friends, but really deliberately go and find people who don\u2019t think like you. What we often say when people gather around the table, which perspective is missing? Look for who\u2019s not at the table and go and invite them in. So Wednesday is make new friends. Thursday your favorite day I believe is storytelling day, which is whatever awesome solutions you\u2019ve come up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"If you don\u2019t communicate it well, it\u2019s as if you didn\u2019t come up with an awesome solution. So we really focus on how to tell a great story and then once you\u2019ve done Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, now you have license to go as fast as you can. So we call the book Move Fast and Fix Things. It\u2019s really a counter to move fast and break things that Mark Zuckerberg made famous, but many people really put out at least implicitly. You can either go fast or you can take care of people, one or the other. In our mind they gave speed a bad name. We find if you do it this way, you can go faster when you fix things than if you broke things. But you can\u2019t do the speed day any earlier than Friday. You actually have to go through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and then you\u2019re in a position to go as fast as you can."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really appreciate you breaking that down. The background work you do allows you to go quickly obviously, and this is not going to surprise you or any of our listeners. I want to linger a little longer on Thursday. I have a couple of questions I\u2019d like to ask. When you tell your stories, do you have a particular structure or way of formulating those stories to really have them provide impact?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"I like the question. So the first thing is that for us, stories have a past, present and future and it\u2019s really important for us to be super deliberate about each one. So when we talk about how the good old days, it\u2019s important to honor what happened in the past, both the good of it and the bad of it because it might\u2019ve been good old days for some and not for others. Hence, we need to change. So honor the past both sides of honor for the present, very few of us want to change unless we have to. And so we need a super clear and compelling change mandate. Why do I have to change now? Can I change next week? What about next month? Next quarter would be next year would be more convenient. All of a sudden it\u2019s just in the ever, ever distant future."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"So why do I have to change now? The joke we often make is that if you\u2019re a retailer and Walmart opens up next door, super clear, super compelling, well, we have to be that clear and that compelling in our story of why now for this change and then the future, which is okay, you want us to change to what? And there\u2019s two aspects of the future that we find to be super necessary. It\u2019s got to be rigorous. You can\u2019t describe some fantastical thing and it has to be optimistic. So people are not going to follow us if you\u2019re going to like, oh, we got to go to the future and it\u2019s going to be grim. Nobody\u2019s getting behind you, but nor are people getting behind us when we\u2019re like, come on, it\u2019s going to be great. And we\u2019re like, why is it going to be great? Oh, it just is not going to work. So we find that honor the past have a clear and compelling change mandate and a rigorous and optimistic way forward that provides the necessary architecture for telling a great story, telling a great change story. And I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying is that this change goes from yesterday to tomorrow."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That structure of past, present future is one that you can see in lots of very motivational presentations and stories that people tell. And I appreciate you breaking it down and the tone with which you deliver it as you mentioned there is also important. It needs to be optimistic. It needs to be motivational and incentivize people to want to strive for it. So I appreciate that structure very much. I\u2019m a huge fan of structure and the past, present future structure I think is ideal for what you\u2019re describing. I want to keep going though on this, you write that the foundation of persuasive communication, communication that will change the way people think and act is to understand something so deeply that you can describe it simply. Can you unpack that for us?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"I love these questions. So I find that when people describe things in simple terms, it\u2019s either because they understood it so deeply that they can describe it that way and that will move me, or they understood it superficially and only one of those is going to move me to action. If I can say there are three components of trust, there are authenticity, logic, and empathy. I\u2019m now describing that very simply. Well, I can do that because I understand it so deeply now, more often than we would like. When people understand something deeply, they use a very complicated way to describe it. So I understand it deeply. I describe it in a complicated way. The problem is you then speak to just a very few people, only the people that can also participate. So if you want broad influence, if you want to have broad persuasion, we have to understand it really deeply and then describe it in a simple and compelling enough way that others can take action and to me so that others can take action in our absence. And that\u2019s where the simplicity part comes in."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s very clear. Those who\u2019ve listened in before have heard my favorite saying that came from my mother, although I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t originate it. Tell me the time, don\u2019t build me the clock. And I think that fits well with what you\u2019re saying is you have to understand how to build the clock, but not everybody wants to know how you built it. They just want to know the time and they want to align with that. So thank you. I am curious if you can talk a bit about emotion and persuasion though."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Yeah. So first of all, I will just say that we think that emotions are underused and there\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve heard so many people give advice, don\u2019t be so emotional, contain your emotions. And I find that to not be correct in most instances. I want people to bring more emotion. Emotion is like the sanding that we can then come and paint on top of emotion really makes us absorptive. So I want us to bring our emotion, but I want us to be able to harness them and use them correctly. To me, not only does emotion make us three dimensional instead of two dimensional, but I think we have greater absorptive capacity in its presence."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love a good analogy and I love the notion of emotion is the sanding you do before you paint and it makes things more absorbent. That\u2019s lovely. And I think that is a perfect way to envision the role of emotion in communication and persuasion. Last thing I\u2019ll ask you about communication. You\u2019ve been around organizations a lot, you studied them. What are one or two of the biggest communication mistakes that organizations make?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"We mistake having said it for your having heard it, I told them as if that matters. I am so uninterested in giving participation trophies in life, but really in this aspect of life, I want to know: did they hear it?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that is so important and I see that play out in my own personal life as a parent, as a partner, as well as a teacher. And I think all of us can imagine circumstances where, hey, we\u2019ve said it, so therefore it\u2019s done without really checking for did somebody hear us and what could I have done better to make it clearer? So thank you for identifying those mistakes and highlighting how we need to address them. Before we end, Francis, I\u2019d like to ask you three questions. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"I\u2019d love it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So my first question for you is your book talks about five days, Monday through Friday, Saturday and Sunday aren\u2019t on that list. What are we doing on those days?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Oh, very importantly, the week has two days of rest and recovery, and that\u2019s how everything should work. You do the work and then you have the rest and recovery. As a former athlete, I knew that my muscles were built while I was resting, so I had to do the workout, but the recovery is when I would actually show the gains. And so the weak has a weak end, and I think it\u2019s a really important metaphor."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. I find myself, and I know many others, use the weekend to catch up on work, and what I\u2019m hearing you say is take the weekend to rejuvenate."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"No, you just substituted the recovery for an extra day and that\u2019s going to catch up on you. That\u2019s going to catch up on you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. Question number two, who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Well, my revealed behavior is that I consume a great deal of comedians. Standup comedy is just something, it\u2019s very difficult for me to imagine 48 hours going by without me consuming some standup comedy. So I\u2019m a connoisseur of that. And I think because they get the simply deeply, they understand an observation so deeply that they can describe it simply how many reps it took them to do that, like a hundred, 500, a thousand. So they also honor the craft of communication, which is, it\u2019s hard to go deeply and then to get it. And I might even say that comedians are deeply simply funny, and that\u2019s like the art form. I\u2019m trying to understand things deeply so I can describe it simply. They\u2019re doing that and then they\u2019re also making it funny. Wow. That\u2019s like another level."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It is amazing to me the depth of experience, practice and work that comedians put in. I have a cousin who\u2019s doing very well as a comedian, and I\u2019ve interviewed several, and you\u2019re absolutely right. And I like how you phrased it though, the simply, deeply funny. That\u2019s the crux of what they do."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"And if I could give a shout-out to the two comedians I find myself listening to over and over again, so I already know what they\u2019re going to say and I still want to listen to it. And that\u2019s saying something, it\u2019s Wanda Sykes and Kathleen Madigan. And I think these two cover a spectrum that\u2019s probably wide enough for your listeners that they\u2019re going to appreciate it, at least one of them."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I enjoy both of them. I\u2019ll let you know a little secret, Frances. One of the things I do as part of my nightly ritual to help me relax and turn off my brain is every night before I go to bed, I\u2019ll listen to a five-minute comedy routine, and both of those comedians are in my playlist. My go-to is Robin Williams. I have just an admiration for his ability to be spontaneous. Alright, question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"I think intention, which is what\u2019s the point of my communication? And again, no participation trophy. My intention is to influence the culture as an example. So I think intention is the first part of it. Two is determination to do the hard work. If we go to our favorite standup comedians who really Jerry Seinfeld is still practicing four or five nights a week, and you know how many CEOs I see go give a really important talk after two reps. So intention, hard work, whatever that word is. But we, let\u2019s refine it and let\u2019s honor it as something that can get better and better and better. And then the third one I\u2019m going to say is joy, which is communication. You mentioned earlier that communication is thought of as a necessary evil. I want to reframe that for people. Communication is the thing that is going to let us unlock unimaginable progress. So let\u2019s look at it as the gift that it really is."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Communication truly is a huge unlock, and thank you for sharing those three ingredients, absolutely critical. That tenacity piece is really, really important. Well, Francis, thank you. I knew we would have a great conversation. I appreciate you introducing us to concepts around trust, around Culture de and I and how to fix things fast. Good luck with your new book. Thank you so much."},{"author":"Frances Frei","text":"Thank you very much, Matt and I get why you have a podcast on communication. You are a beautiful communicator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Why, thank you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve been listening to another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast, a production of Stanford Graduate School of Business.

it comes to change and persuasion, we must think deeply, but communicate simply. Welcome to Think Fast, talk Smart, the podcast. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Today I am super excited to be joined by Francis Frei, who is Professor of Technology and Operations Management at Harvard Business School. Francis served as Uber\u2019s Senior Vice President of Leadership and Strategy, along with Anne Morriss. Francis hosts the Fixable podcast. And together, Anne and Francis wrote Unleashed: The Unapologetic Leader\u2019s Guide to Empowering Everyone Around You and their new book, Move Fast and Fix Things: The Trusted Leader\u2019s Guide to Solving Hard Problems.

Thank you for inviting me."]},{"begin":"57.560","end":"70.480","lines":["Absolutely. So let\u2019s get started. You study and advocate for the value and importance of trust in leadership. Can you share some strategies and tactics leaders can use to build and support trust?"]},{"begin":"70.480","end":"108.360","lines":["Yeah, so the first thing is to realize that many of the sayings we hear are not true. So it takes a long time to build. You lose it in an instant, it can never be rebuilt. None of those statements are true. My first strategic advice is treat trust like you treat everything else you want to build, understand it\u2019s component parts, build it up. If something happens and it gets wobbly, go back in and shore up the part that got wobbly. You don\u2019t have to shore up the rest of it, just the part that got wobbly. So treat it as something that you build and let go of all of the myths around it."]},{"begin":"108.360","end":"122.000","lines":["So it sounds to me like we need to think of trust as something that\u2019s ongoing, that we\u2019re constantly monitoring and measuring and making sure that it\u2019s the level we wish it to be, and if not, we dive right in and fix it. Is that right?"]},{"begin":"122.000","end":"143.920","lines":["I would say is that when you are earning trust, you can think about other things and anytime you have skeptics of one source or another, treat that with precision and urgency to go in and shore up what was in the place and then get it back up to humming along and then I think you don\u2019t have to worry about it quite as much anymore."]},{"begin":"143.920","end":"161.000","lines":["Excellent. And you talked about the different components, so I\u2019d love for you to describe for us your trust triangle, what it is and how we can use it. And I want to follow up on what you just said as well. When you notice that trust is weaker than you want it, what are some of the things you can do to dive in and work on it?"]},{"begin":"161.000","end":"218.680","lines":["Terrific. Essentially the component parts are authenticity, logic and empathy. And what that means is that I am more likely to earn your trust. You are more likely to trust me if you simultaneously experience my authenticity, my logic, and my empathy. If you are blocked from experiencing any one of those three, you\u2019re not going to trust me. That\u2019s when we say it gets wobbly. That\u2019s when we have skeptics. We\u2019re trusted most of the time. So authenticity, logic and empathy are cooking, they\u2019re going, but every single time trust breaks down between individuals, between any stakeholders, between organizations. Anytime it breaks down, we have always been able to trace it back to one of these three and then we get to go get to work on which one it is because you\u2019ll find that the prescriptions are very different for the three of them. So we really have to get that matching right."]},{"begin":"218.680","end":"248.360","lines":["That\u2019s really helpful to have that rubric or key available. And it strikes me, Francis, that reflection is really important in this. A lot of us, myself included, when I feel trust is at risk, I get frustrated and I feel like I\u2019m doing everything I should. Why don\u2019t these people trust me? It sounds like I have to take a step back and really reflect on what\u2019s happening, look at the three that you\u2019ve mentioned and then try to figure out where it is so I can at least make some adjustments."]},{"begin":"248.360","end":"276.200","lines":["Yeah, I\u2019d say, Matt, you gave away a little bit of a tell that you might have an empathy wobble. I\u2019m doing everything right. Why don\u2019t they trust me? That\u2019s a pretty classic empathy wobble. Here\u2019s what I would say. I wonder what it is about my communication that\u2019s getting in the way of them. See how I just flipped it back? Because when people say we have to be self-reflected, I don\u2019t always know how to do it, but I know how to do what I just did with you, which is get curiosity from the other person\u2019s perspective."]},{"begin":"276.200","end":"309.800","lines":["I love it. Thank you. Not only have you helped me, but you\u2019ve demonstrated what we can all do for ourselves and for others, and thank you critically important to take the time to reflect and then to think about how you can reverse the situation to help give the insight that you need. Many of those listening work for organizations that are in various stages of implementing de and i, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Based on your experience, what are some of the best ways to implement, assess and reinforce de and I programs?"]},{"begin":"309.800","end":"361.200","lines":["So we have found that the best way is to think about the letters d, e, and I and change the sequence. So the most important of these three letters is I, it\u2019s inclusion. It\u2019s the one that should be done first when we get inclusion, right? Diversity and equity often follow, but many times I see organizations get diversity, right and equity and inclusion may or may not follow. So I think the first thing is to realize that the focus should be on inclusion and now we have a very specific understanding of how to accelerate inclusion in any organization, but the crisp answer to the question is focus on inclusion and you\u2019re going to go at a much faster pace and get to a much higher place."]},{"begin":"361.200","end":"371.920","lines":["Great. I love the idea of starting with inclusion. Can you give a little more detail into the specifics of what inclusion looks like? Are there stages and steps we can pay attention to?"]},{"begin":"371.920","end":"432.800","lines":["Yes, indeed. So there\u2019s four stages of it and the stages are safe, welcome, celebrated, championed. The way to think about it is that each of us brings magnificent difference to the table. You\u2019re at Stanford, I\u2019m at Harvard, and then we could then list another 20 differences between us and they\u2019re magnificent. The way to think about inclusion is that despite any difference that we\u2019re bringing to the table, we have to set the condition so that each of us feels safe. Once we\u2019ve achieved safety and only once we\u2019ve achieved safety, we graduate to welcome, which is a lighter and lovelier thing that happened. But don\u2019t worry about welcome if you don\u2019t have safety. Once we have achieved safe and welcome, then we want to start celebrating one another for our uniqueness. And I think this is the part that matters instinctually, we often dwell on what we have in common."]},{"begin":"432.800","end":"506.040","lines":["We look for the common ground and that sounds so good. The problem is the more difference we have, the less common we have, and everything that you and I have in common is a little redundant. I want to know how do you think about the world differently than how I think about the world? That\u2019s when we are both collectively going to be better off. So we want to learn the practice of celebrating uniqueness and we want to celebrate uniqueness in one another\u2019s presence, but also in one another\u2019s absence. And we champion people when I am invited into a room, for example, that maybe others aren\u2019t invited into and I speak on their behalf, I\u2019m championing them. And so it goes safe, welcome, celebrated, champion. And that\u2019s what we talk about is how do we move people up the inclusion dial without moving anyone else down the inclusion dial? And that\u2019s if I\u2019d say in 2023 when there\u2019s a lot of controversy around d e, I think much of it can be found in that concept. We\u2019re afraid of moving some people up at the expense of moving others down, and so we have to be clever in how we do this."]},{"begin":"506.040","end":"524.880","lines":["I really appreciate that articulation of the different steps. It really helped me to focus on the different strategies and communication approaches I would take depending on where we are. What I do to build a sense of safety is very different than what I do when I\u2019m celebrating. I"]},{"begin":"524.880","end":"526.040","lines":["Love that."]},{"begin":"526.040","end":"566.800","lines":["I think it\u2019s important for us to realize that it\u2019s a whole toolkit we need. It\u2019s not just one big approach. I want to turn our attention to your new book, move Fast and Fix Things. You and Anne, your co-author and co-host on your podcast and wife strive to accelerate excellence in organizations by helping them, as you say, build and learn quickly while also avoiding costly mistakes. You do this essentially by providing a playbook for how to fix things fast. And you represent this methodology based on a weekday calendar. Can you walk us through the five steps in your playbook? Essentially walk us through Monday through Friday."]},{"begin":"566.800","end":"629.120","lines":["We\u2019ve organized the book by days of the week. Monday, identify your real problem. We\u2019re often presented with the symptoms, but we got to trace back to what the real underlying cause is. So it\u2019s identification day, Tuesday, whatever your problem is. If it involves human beings, trust is broken. Rebuild trust at the center of your problem Wednesday when you\u2019re looking for how to do all the other things you have to do in addition to rebuilding trust, well, you want to go out and get as many gorgeous new perspectives as you can. So we call it make new friends, but really deliberately go and find people who don\u2019t think like you. What we often say when people gather around the table, which perspective is missing? Look for who\u2019s not at the table and go and invite them in. So Wednesday is make new friends. Thursday your favorite day I believe is storytelling day, which is whatever awesome solutions you\u2019ve come up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."]},{"begin":"629.120","end":"683.600","lines":["If you don\u2019t communicate it well, it\u2019s as if you didn\u2019t come up with an awesome solution. So we really focus on how to tell a great story and then once you\u2019ve done Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, now you have license to go as fast as you can. So we call the book Move Fast and Fix Things. It\u2019s really a counter to move fast and break things that Mark Zuckerberg made famous, but many people really put out at least implicitly. You can either go fast or you can take care of people, one or the other. In our mind they gave speed a bad name. We find if you do it this way, you can go faster when you fix things than if you broke things. But you can\u2019t do the speed day any earlier than Friday. You actually have to go through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and then you\u2019re in a position to go as fast as you can."]},{"begin":"683.600","end":"707.560","lines":["I really appreciate you breaking that down. The background work you do allows you to go quickly obviously, and this is not going to surprise you or any of our listeners. I want to linger a little longer on Thursday. I have a couple of questions I\u2019d like to ask. When you tell your stories, do you have a particular structure or way of formulating those stories to really have them provide impact?"]},{"begin":"707.560","end":"756.800","lines":["I like the question. So the first thing is that for us, stories have a past, present and future and it\u2019s really important for us to be super deliberate about each one. So when we talk about how the good old days, it\u2019s important to honor what happened in the past, both the good of it and the bad of it because it might\u2019ve been good old days for some and not for others. Hence, we need to change. So honor the past both sides of honor for the present, very few of us want to change unless we have to. And so we need a super clear and compelling change mandate. Why do I have to change now? Can I change next week? What about next month? Next quarter would be next year would be more convenient. All of a sudden it\u2019s just in the ever, ever distant future."]},{"begin":"756.800","end":"823.800","lines":["So why do I have to change now? The joke we often make is that if you\u2019re a retailer and Walmart opens up next door, super clear, super compelling, well, we have to be that clear and that compelling in our story of why now for this change and then the future, which is okay, you want us to change to what? And there\u2019s two aspects of the future that we find to be super necessary. It\u2019s got to be rigorous. You can\u2019t describe some fantastical thing and it has to be optimistic. So people are not going to follow us if you\u2019re going to like, oh, we got to go to the future and it\u2019s going to be grim. Nobody\u2019s getting behind you, but nor are people getting behind us when we\u2019re like, come on, it\u2019s going to be great. And we\u2019re like, why is it going to be great? Oh, it just is not going to work. So we find that honor the past have a clear and compelling change mandate and a rigorous and optimistic way forward that provides the necessary architecture for telling a great story, telling a great change story. And I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying is that this change goes from yesterday to tomorrow."]},{"begin":"823.800","end":"871.960","lines":["That structure of past, present future is one that you can see in lots of very motivational presentations and stories that people tell. And I appreciate you breaking it down and the tone with which you deliver it as you mentioned there is also important. It needs to be optimistic. It needs to be motivational and incentivize people to want to strive for it. So I appreciate that structure very much. I\u2019m a huge fan of structure and the past, present future structure I think is ideal for what you\u2019re describing. I want to keep going though on this, you write that the foundation of persuasive communication, communication that will change the way people think and act is to understand something so deeply that you can describe it simply. Can you unpack that for us?"]},{"begin":"871.960","end":"945.000","lines":["I love these questions. So I find that when people describe things in simple terms, it\u2019s either because they understood it so deeply that they can describe it that way and that will move me, or they understood it superficially and only one of those is going to move me to action. If I can say there are three components of trust, there are authenticity, logic, and empathy. I\u2019m now describing that very simply. Well, I can do that because I understand it so deeply now, more often than we would like. When people understand something deeply, they use a very complicated way to describe it. So I understand it deeply. I describe it in a complicated way. The problem is you then speak to just a very few people, only the people that can also participate. So if you want broad influence, if you want to have broad persuasion, we have to understand it really deeply and then describe it in a simple and compelling enough way that others can take action and to me so that others can take action in our absence. And that\u2019s where the simplicity part comes in."]},{"begin":"945.000","end":"971.440","lines":["That\u2019s very clear. Those who\u2019ve listened in before have heard my favorite saying that came from my mother, although I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t originate it. Tell me the time, don\u2019t build me the clock. And I think that fits well with what you\u2019re saying is you have to understand how to build the clock, but not everybody wants to know how you built it. They just want to know the time and they want to align with that. So thank you. I am curious if you can talk a bit about emotion and persuasion though."]},{"begin":"971.440","end":"1017.120","lines":["Yeah. So first of all, I will just say that we think that emotions are underused and there\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve heard so many people give advice, don\u2019t be so emotional, contain your emotions. And I find that to not be correct in most instances. I want people to bring more emotion. Emotion is like the sanding that we can then come and paint on top of emotion really makes us absorptive. So I want us to bring our emotion, but I want us to be able to harness them and use them correctly. To me, not only does emotion make us three dimensional instead of two dimensional, but I think we have greater absorptive capacity in its presence."]},{"begin":"1017.120","end":"1046.640","lines":["I love a good analogy and I love the notion of emotion is the sanding you do before you paint and it makes things more absorbent. That\u2019s lovely. And I think that is a perfect way to envision the role of emotion in communication and persuasion. Last thing I\u2019ll ask you about communication. You\u2019ve been around organizations a lot, you studied them. What are one or two of the biggest communication mistakes that organizations make?"]},{"begin":"1046.640","end":"1069.160","lines":["We mistake having said it for your having heard it, I told them as if that matters. I am so uninterested in giving participation trophies in life, but really in this aspect of life, I want to know: did they hear it?"]},{"begin":"1069.160","end":"1104.760","lines":["I think that is so important and I see that play out in my own personal life as a parent, as a partner, as well as a teacher. And I think all of us can imagine circumstances where, hey, we\u2019ve said it, so therefore it\u2019s done without really checking for did somebody hear us and what could I have done better to make it clearer? So thank you for identifying those mistakes and highlighting how we need to address them. Before we end, Francis, I\u2019d like to ask you three questions. Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"1104.760","end":"1105.640","lines":["I\u2019d love it."]},{"begin":"1105.640","end":"1116.120","lines":["So my first question for you is your book talks about five days, Monday through Friday, Saturday and Sunday aren\u2019t on that list. What are we doing on those days?"]},{"begin":"1116.120","end":"1142.320","lines":["Oh, very importantly, the week has two days of rest and recovery, and that\u2019s how everything should work. You do the work and then you have the rest and recovery. As a former athlete, I knew that my muscles were built while I was resting, so I had to do the workout, but the recovery is when I would actually show the gains. And so the weak has a weak end, and I think it\u2019s a really important metaphor."]},{"begin":"1142.320","end":"1151.240","lines":["Absolutely. I find myself, and I know many others, use the weekend to catch up on work, and what I\u2019m hearing you say is take the weekend to rejuvenate."]},{"begin":"1151.240","end":"1157.520","lines":["No, you just substituted the recovery for an extra day and that\u2019s going to catch up on you. That\u2019s going to catch up on you."]},{"begin":"1157.520","end":"1163.080","lines":["Absolutely. Question number two, who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1163.080","end":"1218.680","lines":["Well, my revealed behavior is that I consume a great deal of comedians. Standup comedy is just something, it\u2019s very difficult for me to imagine 48 hours going by without me consuming some standup comedy. So I\u2019m a connoisseur of that. And I think because they get the simply deeply, they understand an observation so deeply that they can describe it simply how many reps it took them to do that, like a hundred, 500, a thousand. So they also honor the craft of communication, which is, it\u2019s hard to go deeply and then to get it. And I might even say that comedians are deeply simply funny, and that\u2019s like the art form. I\u2019m trying to understand things deeply so I can describe it simply. They\u2019re doing that and then they\u2019re also making it funny. Wow. That\u2019s like another level."]},{"begin":"1218.680","end":"1239.960","lines":["It is amazing to me the depth of experience, practice and work that comedians put in. I have a cousin who\u2019s doing very well as a comedian, and I\u2019ve interviewed several, and you\u2019re absolutely right. And I like how you phrased it though, the simply, deeply funny. That\u2019s the crux of what they do."]},{"begin":"1239.960","end":"1264.480","lines":["And if I could give a shout-out to the two comedians I find myself listening to over and over again, so I already know what they\u2019re going to say and I still want to listen to it. And that\u2019s saying something, it\u2019s Wanda Sykes and Kathleen Madigan. And I think these two cover a spectrum that\u2019s probably wide enough for your listeners that they\u2019re going to appreciate it, at least one of them."]},{"begin":"1264.480","end":"1294.640","lines":["I enjoy both of them. I\u2019ll let you know a little secret, Frances. One of the things I do as part of my nightly ritual to help me relax and turn off my brain is every night before I go to bed, I\u2019ll listen to a five-minute comedy routine, and both of those comedians are in my playlist. My go-to is Robin Williams. I have just an admiration for his ability to be spontaneous. Alright, question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1294.640","end":"1361.000","lines":["I think intention, which is what\u2019s the point of my communication? And again, no participation trophy. My intention is to influence the culture as an example. So I think intention is the first part of it. Two is determination to do the hard work. If we go to our favorite standup comedians who really Jerry Seinfeld is still practicing four or five nights a week, and you know how many CEOs I see go give a really important talk after two reps. So intention, hard work, whatever that word is. But we, let\u2019s refine it and let\u2019s honor it as something that can get better and better and better. And then the third one I\u2019m going to say is joy, which is communication. You mentioned earlier that communication is thought of as a necessary evil. I want to reframe that for people. Communication is the thing that is going to let us unlock unimaginable progress. So let\u2019s look at it as the gift that it really is."]},{"begin":"1361.000","end":"1384.800","lines":["Communication truly is a huge unlock, and thank you for sharing those three ingredients, absolutely critical. That tenacity piece is really, really important. Well, Francis, thank you. I knew we would have a great conversation. I appreciate you introducing us to concepts around trust, around Culture de and I and how to fix things fast. Good luck with your new book. Thank you so much."]},{"begin":"1384.800","end":"1391.000","lines":["Thank you very much, Matt and I get why you have a podcast on communication.
