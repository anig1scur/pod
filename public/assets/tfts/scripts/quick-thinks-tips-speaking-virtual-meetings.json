My name is Matt Abrahams and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business and welcome to a Quick Thinks episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Based on the work I have done as a lecturer at Stanford GSB as well as in my consulting practice, there are some specific techniques and tools you can use to insert your ideas in a conversation, a meeting, or even a presentation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The three best tools that I am aware of are to start with a paraphrase. When somebody is speaking and you want to contribute, you can simply interject a paraphrase. Capture something that they\u2019ve said, it doesn\u2019t have to be a grand paraphrase where you say \u201cso what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d You can just jump on a particular topic, like \u201cPricing!\u201d Paraphrasing is a polite way to get your point into a presentation or into a meeting."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Another tool is to simply ask a question, so as somebody is speaking you might say, \u201cI have a question about that point.\u201d And that question can be one where it\u2019s presented in a polite, concerned way, or perhaps in a more direct way. So tone matters."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The final way is to simple start with an emotion, \u201cThat concerns me\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m excited by.\u201d That emotion gives you permission to then follow up. By paraphrasing, asking a question, or stating an emotion, you can get the floor in an in-person or virtual communication situation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Now once you have that floor, you have to contribute. We know from our own personal experience that if we are unstructured, meandering and wandering, people aren\u2019t going to take away what we want them to. We must be clear and concise. The way we become clear and concise is by using some kind of message design or structure. And there are many, many that exist. Structure gives us a place to start, it gives us a place to end, it helps us connect our ideas together. My favorite structure for making contributions in meetings, conversations, and presentations is simply three questions: What, so what, now what. This gives you the guide, the map if you will, for what it is you need to say. You start with the what, \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re talking about,\u201d It could be a process, a product, a point of view."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The So What is \u201cWhy is it important\u201d to the people you\u2019re speaking to, perhaps to the company, or even society at large."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And then the Now What is what you want to come next, it could be action items, a follow-up meeting, a demonstration, but it is the action that follows. What, So What, Now What, is a super powerful structure that upon practicing and becoming comfortable with it can really help you construct your messages so that they are packaged well for your audience to understand. I encourage you to take these tools for inserting your ideas as well as the notion of message design through structure to help you be more effective in your communication."}],"audio":"https://content.production.cdn.art19.com/segment_lists/b3d0cdb6-3adf-46eb-bb94-3d130139c3fe/20200402-UXVpY2tUaGlua3NfU3RydWN0dXJlX0RyYWZ0Mi53YXY-44ec4ca6-3b5f-4e3c-a821-ae38ae7d5210.mp3","img":"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/styles/1630x_variable/public/tfts-key_logo_21.jpg.webp?itok=S-EaSW2x","authors":["Matt Abrahams"],"wave_peaks":[97,14897,12971,7783,4073,3912,1260,9529,13012,10829,6896,7330,4034,5708,5208,7942,5533,4555,2740,1046,84,2627,4641,8020,5092,2635,8993,8470,8872,8598,8216,4630,13174,9186,3909,4993,5228,2294,138,14614,9509,4413,122,5403,7123,5575,4492,6539,4680,97,206,7374,11663,12982,8125,5762,9983,5032,6205,4809,6072,4216,3913,2126,1147,4616,9285,6486,7637,8559,4227,6191,6948,2945,6406,4048,8149,7734,5134,2031,6102,5587,4291,2823,1823,483,586,780,17264,10467,8918,5388,1599,3853,13265,4624,6834,4337,4827,4811,2792,6644,5906,4793,3657,3199,2835,1212,20637,13825,7663,10809,5400,9258,7047,3834,2331,8117,8529,10092,9957,3324,11721,5985,5046,4817,3434,5057,3475,3347,2643,3263,3254,3348,3439,3485,14140,9098,10220,7195,4208,5509,9933,6098,4853,4970,5059,4735,9478,4739,4054,3457,3992,2514,2486,15572,8211,9189,5870,6485,4531,4627,5042,4597,1449,751,8665,11029,13313,9338,5310,3109,4835,4725,4657,3908,6858,5868,5783,3227,1768,388,9480,6729,13451,17854,4679,5523,8249,7158,4080,1405,6820,3993,5503,10206,11015,9476,8372,3568,1930,11577,9169,4826,4057,5824,2273,2875,3189,5545,10239,7162,6097,5394,10083,8646,11344,10309,8635,5393,6390,5774,5865,427,4767,11582,7918,8801,6488,7148,5188,5349,7362,5280,3342,3533,6904,9869,7665,5283,7511,4343,4962,10714,14492,3110,5099,9436,2541,10576,4189,3208,2597,283,1904,12301,9153,3687,8312,6453,3107,4107,7061,3713,2969,5925,3805,4605,4781,2607,3390,1809,603,613,180,11777,18764,4997,6267,8658,11015,7779,5825,7028,5798,3989,4555,4774,3734,3265,10139,7011,10373,8332,4993,1717,171,185,10389,11124,6110,262,7524,7266,9915,10839,9659,7987,4169,246,11473,10384,9985,5890,4413,7918,9631,103,2063,8916,8998,3577,11267,10623,11909,6515,5702,3353,4861,7569,4993,1946,341,231,110,14644,18693,6635,9645,9933,8831,14208,11707,4864,4024,2455,167,138,9678,8247,5456,1559,2266,8835,11873,7903,2987,203,15507,11242,4918,5952,5418,3500,4669,4432,2116,705,16263,13886,14069,9474,2422,9005,10158,7964,6581,1370,6417,6123,6393,6170,1748,5766,5277,7192,6023,5143,3685,5861,8414,9354,3280,6510,12023,4489,4511,825,7132,6523,3410,2263,2159,110,370,16223,10009,12069,7219,9253,12092,6002,3905,212,9985,14274,13514,8586,9899,5118,6460,6099,6343,9359,8749,10286,10037,4577,5246,7182,8842,8431,5084,1871,11389,3810,6721,5735,6224,5359,4607,3504,2640,1568,2433,12275,5246,6422,6244,3767,2858,668,9945,14334,3593,5008,4917,6376,5606,5813,5562,6444,7385,4156,5431,6753,4628,6765,2244,3687,2982,1600,526,13776,12996,11353,5593,9656,3047,1743,2553,163,14322,16903,6267,5457,4085,7409,4507,4300,4472,1730,8244,10277,7497,7662,4219,6054,2722,180,473,13619,15665,9286,7336,2384,471,8142,11850,8942,3001,4910,1649,2532,6457,7706,1440,127,156,7556,7860,4619,4685,3528,4835,7159,5540,4418,3186,1121,1027,3095,10243,147,96,10587,11269,3774,1421,7819,1291,204,100,93,96,15041,10221,7340,11126,11773,6985,10274,9668,3794,1999,557,10705,7908,3916,3572,2290,402,17347,10585,10440,2784,4493,8278,6635,7133,4450,4175,10347,12472,3309,8520,4840,7227,4948,4056,3861,450,91,187,289,13473,13007,4981,6896,6541,5428,4560,1047,8128,5141,5371,4044,1418,112,12225,5912,5578,5628,1047,9220,8534,9522,5255,3357,3543,630,113,10572,7920,7935,2838,757,7169,10015,5906,5498,4590,3633,2758,1840,3710,7400,3794,97,10635,13893,4773,1975,120,6286,9136,7324,4119,1237,11291,10944,8593,3946,1184,284,16652,7517,4812,4995,5061,4287,1644,395,1028,14408,7421,7409,3705,3233,3531,3798,4888,6488,3067,2358,6111,2664,389,14376,1103,8830,10348,15456,4601,4696,6136,6443,4423,4215,6287,6869,3067,272,3034,12638,7051,6240,2547,2180,10119,4860,5509,12142,3890,6372,4854,4000,2815,1922,2816,1663,126,120,477,11049,9968,12836,3141,7771,4002,3568,1650,7429,9807,8785,6544,2756,1242,11566,11525,8665,6034,6616,6671,6449,6075,5288,4687,5592,1591,5109,8589,5025,4930,4839,12514,4802,822,7197,5046,3067,2356,1313,1755,1009,212,429,1641,1130,1169,920,824,929,855,716,662,753,799,661,719,764,629,638,716,668,623,564,474,532,454,320,282,258,146,130,5,2,6,5,4],"fragments":[{"begin":"0.000","end":"15.480","lines":["We\u2019ve all been in the situation where you have something important to contribute to a meeting or a presentation and you just don\u2019t know how to insert your thoughts.
