But to convey deeper meaning, we need a broader color palette, which Dana Carney says requires the mastery of nonverbal communication.","We often focus on the words that we say when honing our communication, but according to Carney, there are many instances \u201cwhere nonverbals start to be more meaningful than verbals.\u201d A professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business and the George Quist Chair in Business Ethics, Carney researches the nonverbal ways in which we communicate our biases, our preferences, our power, and our status.","As Carney explores in her forthcoming book, The Five Nonverbal Rules of Power, there are several key areas of nonverbal behavior that we need to grasp in order to fully tap our potential as communicators. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, she and host Matt Abrahams discuss how to read the nonverbal communication of others \u2014 and how to gain control of the nonverbals we express to the world."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m old enough to remember watching television in black and white, and the day we got our first color tv, my mind was blown. The same thing is true when you go from just focusing on verbal messages to thinking about nonverbal communication. My name is Matt Abraham\u2019s and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast. Today I am really excited to talk with Dana Carney. Dana is the George Quis chair in business ethics at Berkeley\u2019s HA School of Business. This year she\u2019s on sabbatical from Berkeley and is spending time with us here in the management group at the GSB. Her research focuses on the nonverbal ways in which we communicate our biases, our preferences, our power, and our status. Her forthcoming book on nonverbal behavior is expected at the end of the year. Welcome, Dana. I am really looking forward to our conversation. Thanks for being here,"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Matt. Thank you so much for having me. I was so excited when you reached out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Should we get started?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[01:04]: Dana, I\u2019m so excited for this conversation because I have long been fascinated by your research and nonverbal communication. When I teach nonverbal communication, I referenced the three vs. Visual, verbal and vocal. Visual is what we see. Verbal is the words and fillers and spaces that we have, and then vocal is how we say those words. I\u2019m curious, do you see nonverbal communication the same way and how do you explain it when you talk about it"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[01:34]: Almost the same way? First, there\u2019s two big circles, Venn diagram overlapping circles. One is the perception side. What are the nonverbal behaviors that we need to pay attention to when we\u2019re trying to make sense of or understand other people or situations? Then there\u2019s the expression side, which is what are the behaviors that we can use as tools to express or land a particular attribute? So I would layer those on top of your three Vs. And then I would add, when you said visual, I would split that into face and body as separate channels."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So nonverbals gives us a whole set of tools through which we can communicate information, and some of it are things we can control as you mentioned, and other things are things that perhaps are a less in our control, but we convey information through the words we say, but also how we say it and the demeanor with which we say it. I find this fascinating because there\u2019s this whole other channel that we often don\u2019t think about. Can you discuss how our perceptions of power in status are influenced by nonverbal communication?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[02:40]: So it\u2019s an entire chapter in my books in the chapter, it\u2019s called The Five Nonverbal Rules of Power, and what it is is a Venn diagram where the perception nonverbals, the ones we need to know to read power accurately and the ones that people think are associated with power they intersect, and five areas of nonverbal behavior that if we remember those we can really tap into power and I\u2019ll give you two that I think are particularly useful because people have a lot of control over them. One of them is eye contact. When you look at someone when you\u2019re speaking and when they\u2019re speaking, you\u2019re really taking up space with your eyes. You\u2019re not only saying, I see you, I hear you, but also I\u2019m speaking to you and distributing that around the room. You\u2019re almost spreading yourself around the room when you\u2019re looking around there."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[03:33] So eye contact is one that we have control over and it\u2019s easy to force yourself to distribute and to use, and it has additional benefits. Not only does it convey power, but it conveys intelligence and warmth. So you just can\u2019t go wrong with eye contact. So that would be one that I would say is one that everyone can practice and use. And another one is expansion. And I don\u2019t just mean with your body, I don\u2019t just mean taking up physical space with the bubble that\u2019s around your body. I mean expansion in all kinds of ways. So taking a longer time to say what you\u2019re saying, if you take more time, you are taking up space. So you see there\u2019s a number of ways of taking up space. You can do it with how much you speak, how slowly you speak physically, spreading your body out in a way that feels comfortable. So those were the two I would say are easy to control and there\u2019s a version of each that most people could probably find."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[04:37]: So taking space and connecting through space, through eye contact, really important. That example of all the things we could do to take space shows the different types of paint that we can use to paint in this nonverbal way. It\u2019s how you say it, how long you say it, how you physically show up, and not just you personally, but the stuff you put in front of you. All of that. And there\u2019s this whole conversation that\u2019s happening at that level that we perceive that we don\u2019t necessarily consciously think about. I want to dive just a little deeper. Clearly culture and context plays a role in this. Some cultures I\u2019m aware of, eye contact is actually seen as rude because you\u2019re supposed to defer. What\u2019s your take on the intersection of culture and context when it comes to nonverbals"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Eye contact? There\u2019s not a lot of variability across culture when it comes to the speaker making eye contact with others. It\u2019s where the rudeness or the cross-cultural variability in whether or not you\u2019re being disrespectful comes from whether you\u2019re looking at the speaker when you\u2019re being spoken to. So it\u2019s when you\u2019re on the receiving end of being yelled at or reprimanded or whatever. Looking back is typically where you see the variability, not if I\u2019m the speaker and I look at you, but yes, context matters, culture matters. So what I like to say is that there are certain sort of pillars that are safe spaces. For example, if you\u2019re trying to convey warmth, looking at someone being a little bit closer to them, how close varies by culture, but proximity in general is associated with intimacy, body orientation toward, so these are all cues called immediacy cues, directing your communication toward them, like talking to them and smiling or nodding like you\u2019re doing now you\u2019re encouraging me smiling and nodding."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Those are called back channel responses. They unconsciously or implicitly are saying, I hear you, I see you. I recognize what you\u2019re saying. We\u2019re on the same page. There\u2019s a cluster of things that convey liking, and so there might be some variability around how close or how much eye contact, but generally speaking, those are safe. And so when we go to another culture, we just need to figure out what are the boundaries around. So if I go to one culture, it\u2019s two kisses, kiss, kiss, other cultures, there\u2019s three kisses, kiss, kiss, kiss, other cultures, it\u2019s the left cheek for them, another right? So it\u2019s kind of like those things. It\u2019s a nonverbal version of how many cheeks do I kiss and how many times. Right,"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[07:16]: Right. I appreciate that answer. It\u2019s very nuanced and there\u2019s complexity to it, but that\u2019s the reality of nonverbal communication. This is not simple. I\u2019m taking several things away from what you said. One that there are some foundational principles are, as you said, safe spaces around which there\u2019s nuance that is culturally learnable and we just have to be sensitive to that. And so the big message I\u2019m taking away is we just have to build awareness and be sensitive. We can ask, we can observe, we can research to learn what\u2019s appropriate and not appropriate and know that by invoking the appropriate nonverbals, we can achieve goals like demonstrating warmth and liking that can really help us in ways sometimes that our words don\u2019t allow us to do."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[08:01]: I have another question for you about the relative value of nonverbals and actual messages. Where do you fall on the relative importance of verbal content versus nonverbal behavior? In other words, what we say versus how we say it?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"No, I don\u2019t think any reasonable scientists would say that nonverbal is more important than verbal. I think most of us would say both are extremely important. If we\u2019re in a domain where I have a reason to lie or maybe I don\u2019t know, racial bias and discrimination being one, right? People aren\u2019t aware of their biases or they are aware of them, but maybe not the extent to which they hold them, then we get into some territory where nonverbals start to be maybe more meaningful than verbals because I don\u2019t realize that I have bias. I think that when you get into territory where either people don\u2019t have introspective access to how they think or feel or they have their incentivized not to reveal it, right? In an economic game or a strategic interaction or a negotiation, that\u2019s where nonverbal becomes really fun and interesting and useful because words aren\u2019t enough in that case."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. Yeah. So they\u2019re both important and sometimes differentially important depending on the context, which again brings us back to this notion of context. So I have an example I always use when I teach. If you\u2019re in a doctor\u2019s office and the doctor says, how are you doing? That means one thing. If you\u2019re at a bar at a party and somebody says, how are you doing? That means something very different. The words are the same, the environment and context is different, and we somehow know how to navigate through that, but also we can run into a lot of trouble when we misunderstand."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[09:46]: Yes, and this is when knowing what our goal is is so incredibly important. If I\u2019m at that bar and my goal is I\u2019m attracted to this person and so I want to convey some attraction, so I might dip into some cues associated with attraction or being attractive. So when people use a breathier voice, they can come off as a little more attractive versus I\u2019m a doctor and my goal is empathy. I want you to know that I\u2019m listening. So the first thing you need to think about in a context is what\u2019s my goal here? If I\u2019m a doctor, I want to make sure that my patient feels heard and understood. If I\u2019m in a bar and I just truly want to know how someone\u2019s doing, I don\u2019t want to use a vocal tone that might express attraction, I might want to be more casual or upbeat like, Hey, how you doing?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[10:39] Use colloquial tone of voice with a lot of vocal variability that might be associated with having a good time. So that\u2019s the first thing to do is what is my goal in this social interaction? And look, all of this stuff is happening in a fraction of a second, right? I mean, we don\u2019t sit down and script out what we\u2019re going to do before I\u2019m going to go to the barge, and when I see this person, I\u2019m going to say, I like to think about nonverbal communication as a language. Because once we kind of know what\u2019s the list of cues associated with liking, which ones of those are associated with platonic liking versus intimate liking, and when I do this one, oh gosh, I don\u2019t mean to be sending the wrong signal. So now not to do them and which behaviors are associated with being trusted, which behaviors are associated with conveying power? That I think really will help us think about how can I best land whatever it is that I am trying to land."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[11:33]: We\u2019ve talked often about this notion of having a goal. When you communicate by default, I think many people think of the words that I say, and what I\u2019m hearing you say is we have to expand that goal to be thinking about how do we achieve that goal, not just through the words we say, but how we say it. And that\u2019s really, really important. This notion of there\u2019s a language and we have to understand and become fluent in that language, and some are more fluent than others, perhaps we have a time to talk about the people receiving that language. If I\u2019m at a bar and hope that you\u2019re signaling attraction to me, I\u2019m going to be looking for things in a way that I might not if I weren\u2019t the rose colored glasses, if you will, which I think is a separate conversation about our perception of nonverbals, not just our signaling of nonverbals"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[12:19]: Sometimes the nonverbal cues overlap, but if the audience takes one thing away from this conversation about nonverbal communication, it\u2019s that there are perception and expression and they\u2019re different, and also they overlap. And the easiest places to memorize what are the cues are the places of overlap, which is when we talked about the five non-verbal rules of power, and I gave you two of them, that they\u2019re at the intersection of both perception and expression, which is those are the nice ones to memorize and practice because they do both."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[12:52]: Excellent. I want to keep this notion of language fluency. What are some things that we can do to become more aware of our nonverbal communication and how they come across? When I\u2019m learning a language, I practice with people who say, no, your accent\u2019s off, or you\u2019re saying that wrong. What are some things that we can do to actually become more fluent? How can we learn about it? I ask my students to digitally record themselves as they practice. So they see their nonverbals and they watch it, and then they listen to it separately. So they\u2019re hearing the different channels. What advice do you have about ways to help us become more conscious of what we\u2019re doing? Because a lot of this is unconscious."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[13:29]: Yes, that is exactly right. Hearing or seeing ourselves. So watching yourself is a really big way to know how, at least, how you perceive yourself. I would add some layers on top of that. First of all, in an exercise like that, right down beforehand, one or two goals that you have for that interaction. Do I want to try to come off as really smart here? Do I want to be warm? Am I trying to make new friends? Am I trying to do well in this negotiation? Am I trying to do well in this negotiation and retain friends? What\u2019s my goal? And then I watch that video or listen to the audio, and I try to assess whether I appropriately land it that way. At least did I think that I correctly sent the messages I intended to send? That\u2019s one piece of the puzzle, but that\u2019s your perception."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[14:20] Now it\u2019s a matter of what did other people perceive. A big part of it is I intended to be kind, and when I look at myself, I seem to be kind, but we lack self-awareness about how we come across sometimes. And other people will see us and say like, oh, no, no, no. Let\u2019s say our faces tend to be a little cranky, and we know that we smiled three more times in that interaction. So for us, we\u2019re like, I was so nice in that interaction. I smiled three times. I never smile. So for us, we knew it was a big deviation from our baseline, and so we think we landed in a really warm positive way, but a stranger or another person with whom we interacted, if they were to watch and make ratings on those same dimensions, might give us a much lower score, which helps us assess, okay, so how I intended to land and whether or not I was successful, and then there was how did other people perceive that? And so that\u2019s the missing piece in that puzzle is how do other people perceive you? And a layer a bit more on top of that, which is how do strangers perceive you versus friends or people who know you a little bit?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[15:34]: This is really useful in that we can all look to better understand our nonverbal presence in terms of how it\u2019s landing. We have our intent and we can see it, and we have knowledge relative to our baseline, but we also have to seek outside of ourselves. And when we do that, we also have to think about how much does information does that other person have about us? That\u2019s really insightful, and in fact, it\u2019s going to change the way I have my students look at their own behavior."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[16:07]: I like to say the only way to get better at communication, verbal or nonverbal is three things, repetition, reflection, and feedback. You have to practice, you have to reflect, and then you have to give feedback. Dana, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you some questions. The first question will be unique to you, and then the other two are questions I ask everybody. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Yep, sounds great."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[16:28]: Is there a particular nonverbal behavior that you look to assess credibility and confidence when you\u2019re talking to others? What is it that you look for as an expert in this? Is there one thing you look for?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"Yes. We have not talked about coherence across channels. We talked about different channels of communication, the voice, the body, the face, but we haven\u2019t talked about consistency across those channels. I\u2019m looking for consistency across channels. If my face and my body and my voice and my words, if all of those things are saying the same thing, that makes me feel like that person is full in that way, I feel comfortable with them. Not only that they know what they\u2019re talking about and they know whatever they\u2019re saying is probably true. That is the thing that I pay attention to the most. And if people are inconsistent across channel, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something\u2019s awry, but it\u2019s something I pay attention to because it provides information about are they conflicted about what it is they\u2019re talking about."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[17:37]: I appreciate you sharing with us this notion of coherence because we\u2019ve really dissected nonverbal communication into these very specific parts, and we have to remember that there\u2019s a totality and whole that gets communicated and that we can assess that as well. It\u2019s not just, did you make eye contact? It\u2019s is the eye contact consistent with the body posture, with the vocal tone and the words and the words to help? Thank you. Question number two, who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[18:05]: Winston Churchill, the two reasons I think that he\u2019s just one of the best communicators, or the one that I probably look up to the most is that, I mean, he was so effective in being able to grab the hearts and minds of an entire country and to galvanize people. And the second reason is that Winston Churchill turned a speech impediment into his greatest source of power. He had a stutter, and he turned that into pause because of his stutter, he learned to pause a lot and to use those pauses extremely effectively,"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[18:43]: Truly an amazing communicator, and he worked hard. Final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[18:53]: So first of all, we had talked about goals, right? You have to know what your goal is. If you don\u2019t have clarity, at least a little bit of clarity about what your goal is, then you\u2019re not going to be very effective. So my goal today was just to be clear, I didn\u2019t quite know where we were going to go. I just knew that it was important for me to, whatever it was that I was going to get it across in a way that was at least a little bit succinct. Then knowing the nonverbal behaviors that land best for us, and that goes back to what we were talking about, the baseline knowing how we typically are so that we can figure out like, okay, I need to dial up the warmth. I don\u2019t come across warmly at all. Like, gosh, I kind of see mean I\u2019m not mean at all."},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"[19:40] It\u2019s not that you\u2019re trying to be something that you\u2019re not. It\u2019s that you are something, but it doesn\u2019t come across and you\u2019re like, oh gosh, how do I fix that? Right? And that\u2019s where your idea of practice. So then it\u2019s knowing which cues I can dabble in. There\u2019s a long list of immediacy cues that you can look at to try to practice and try on to figure out which one suits you the best, literally. And then what you said, practice, and it\u2019s not about faking it or not being authentic. It really is about, I am a nice person, or let\u2019s say you\u2019re not a nice person. Let\u2019s say you truly are not a nice person. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a cranky person, but there are sometimes that you\u2019re nice and let\u2019s say your goal is to be nice right now. So my advice is try to think about the times that you want to be nice or that you are nice or that you truly feel nice and say like, okay, what are the things that are most comfortable for me to do when I am being nice? And then tap into those behaviors because those are the ones that are comfortable for you. And then practice them, and they do in fact land the way you intend them to. So those are the ingredients. It\u2019s having a goal, knowing the best nonverbal behaviors that land what you\u2019re intending to land, and then practicing, right? Just making sure that you\u2019re doing them in an unconscious way, that you don\u2019t have to spend a whole lot of time thinking about it, that they\u2019re just automatically coming out of you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[21:09]: So be clear on your goal. Be clear on your baseline and practice. So Dana, thank you so much for your time and for your wisdom. People can\u2019t see this, but I\u2019m bowing my head and putting my hands together to demonstrate gratefulness,"},{"author":"Dana Carney","text":"And I have my hand on my heart and I\u2019m nodding my head to using, saying, thank you so much."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[21:30]: Thank you for joining us for another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast from Stanford, GSB.

old enough to remember watching television in black and white, and the day we got our first color tv, my mind was blown. The same thing is true when you go from just focusing on verbal messages to thinking about nonverbal communication. My name is Matt Abraham\u2019s and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast. Today I am really excited to talk with Dana Carney. Dana is the George Quis chair in business ethics at Berkeley\u2019s HA School of Business. This year she\u2019s on sabbatical from Berkeley and is spending time with us here in the management group at the GSB. Her research focuses on the nonverbal ways in which we communicate our biases, our preferences, our power, and our status. Her forthcoming book on nonverbal behavior is expected at the end of the year. Welcome, Dana. I am really looking forward to our conversation. Thanks for being here,"]},{"begin":"59.080","end":"62.720","lines":["Matt. Thank you so much for having me. I was so excited when you reached out."]},{"begin":"62.720","end":"63.640","lines":["Should we get started?"]},{"begin":"63.640","end":"64.200","lines":["Absolutely."]},{"begin":"64.200","end":"93.040","lines":["[01:04]: Dana, I\u2019m so excited for this conversation because I have long been fascinated by your research and nonverbal communication. When I teach nonverbal communication, I referenced the three vs. Visual, verbal and vocal. Visual is what we see. Verbal is the words and fillers and spaces that we have, and then vocal is how we say those words. I\u2019m curious, do you see nonverbal communication the same way and how do you explain it when you talk about it"]},{"begin":"93.040","end":"131.520","lines":["[01:34]: Almost the same way? First, there\u2019s two big circles, Venn diagram overlapping circles. One is the perception side. What are the nonverbal behaviors that we need to pay attention to when we\u2019re trying to make sense of or understand other people or situations? Then there\u2019s the expression side, which is what are the behaviors that we can use as tools to express or land a particular attribute? So I would layer those on top of your three Vs. And then I would add, when you said visual, I would split that into face and body as separate channels."]},{"begin":"131.520","end":"160.520","lines":["So nonverbals gives us a whole set of tools through which we can communicate information, and some of it are things we can control as you mentioned, and other things are things that perhaps are a less in our control, but we convey information through the words we say, but also how we say it and the demeanor with which we say it. I find this fascinating because there\u2019s this whole other channel that we often don\u2019t think about. Can you discuss how our perceptions of power in status are influenced by nonverbal communication?"]},{"begin":"160.520","end":"212.480","lines":["[02:40]: So it\u2019s an entire chapter in my books in the chapter, it\u2019s called The Five Nonverbal Rules of Power, and what it is is a Venn diagram where the perception nonverbals, the ones we need to know to read power accurately and the ones that people think are associated with power they intersect, and five areas of nonverbal behavior that if we remember those we can really tap into power and I\u2019ll give you two that I think are particularly useful because people have a lot of control over them. One of them is eye contact. When you look at someone when you\u2019re speaking and when they\u2019re speaking, you\u2019re really taking up space with your eyes. You\u2019re not only saying, I see you, I hear you, but also I\u2019m speaking to you and distributing that around the room. You\u2019re almost spreading yourself around the room when you\u2019re looking around there."]},{"begin":"212.480","end":"213.680","lines":["[03:33]"]},{"begin":"213.680","end":"276.920","lines":["So eye contact is one that we have control over and it\u2019s easy to force yourself to distribute and to use, and it has additional benefits. Not only does it convey power, but it conveys intelligence and warmth. So you just can\u2019t go wrong with eye contact. So that would be one that I would say is one that everyone can practice and use. And another one is expansion. And I don\u2019t just mean with your body, I don\u2019t just mean taking up physical space with the bubble that\u2019s around your body. I mean expansion in all kinds of ways. So taking a longer time to say what you\u2019re saying, if you take more time, you are taking up space. So you see there\u2019s a number of ways of taking up space. You can do it with how much you speak, how slowly you speak physically, spreading your body out in a way that feels comfortable. So those were the two I would say are easy to control and there\u2019s a version of each that most people could probably find."]},{"begin":"276.920","end":"326.600","lines":["[04:37]: So taking space and connecting through space, through eye contact, really important. That example of all the things we could do to take space shows the different types of paint that we can use to paint in this nonverbal way. It\u2019s how you say it, how long you say it, how you physically show up, and not just you personally, but the stuff you put in front of you. All of that. And there\u2019s this whole conversation that\u2019s happening at that level that we perceive that we don\u2019t necessarily consciously think about. I want to dive just a little deeper. Clearly culture and context plays a role in this. Some cultures I\u2019m aware of, eye contact is actually seen as rude because you\u2019re supposed to defer. What\u2019s your take on the intersection of culture and context when it comes to nonverbals"]},{"begin":"326.600","end":"396.680","lines":["Eye contact? There\u2019s not a lot of variability across culture when it comes to the speaker making eye contact with others. It\u2019s where the rudeness or the cross-cultural variability in whether or not you\u2019re being disrespectful comes from whether you\u2019re looking at the speaker when you\u2019re being spoken to. So it\u2019s when you\u2019re on the receiving end of being yelled at or reprimanded or whatever. Looking back is typically where you see the variability, not if I\u2019m the speaker and I look at you, but yes, context matters, culture matters. So what I like to say is that there are certain sort of pillars that are safe spaces. For example, if you\u2019re trying to convey warmth, looking at someone being a little bit closer to them, how close varies by culture, but proximity in general is associated with intimacy, body orientation toward, so these are all cues called immediacy cues, directing your communication toward them, like talking to them and smiling or nodding like you\u2019re doing now you\u2019re encouraging me smiling and nodding."]},{"begin":"396.680","end":"437.640","lines":["Those are called back channel responses. They unconsciously or implicitly are saying, I hear you, I see you. I recognize what you\u2019re saying. We\u2019re on the same page. There\u2019s a cluster of things that convey liking, and so there might be some variability around how close or how much eye contact, but generally speaking, those are safe. And so when we go to another culture, we just need to figure out what are the boundaries around. So if I go to one culture, it\u2019s two kisses, kiss, kiss, other cultures, there\u2019s three kisses, kiss, kiss, kiss, other cultures, it\u2019s the left cheek for them, another right? So it\u2019s kind of like those things. It\u2019s a nonverbal version of how many cheeks do I kiss and how many times. Right,"]},{"begin":"437.640","end":"480.400","lines":["[07:16]: Right. I appreciate that answer. It\u2019s very nuanced and there\u2019s complexity to it, but that\u2019s the reality of nonverbal communication. This is not simple. I\u2019m taking several things away from what you said. One that there are some foundational principles are, as you said, safe spaces around which there\u2019s nuance that is culturally learnable and we just have to be sensitive to that. And so the big message I\u2019m taking away is we just have to build awareness and be sensitive. We can ask, we can observe, we can research to learn what\u2019s appropriate and not appropriate and know that by invoking the appropriate nonverbals, we can achieve goals like demonstrating warmth and liking that can really help us in ways sometimes that our words don\u2019t allow us to do."]},{"begin":"480.400","end":"481.160","lines":["Exactly."]},{"begin":"481.160","end":"497.640","lines":["[08:01]: I have another question for you about the relative value of nonverbals and actual messages. Where do you fall on the relative importance of verbal content versus nonverbal behavior? In other words, what we say versus how we say it?"]},{"begin":"497.640","end":"555.080","lines":["No, I don\u2019t think any reasonable scientists would say that nonverbal is more important than verbal. I think most of us would say both are extremely important. If we\u2019re in a domain where I have a reason to lie or maybe I don\u2019t know, racial bias and discrimination being one, right? People aren\u2019t aware of their biases or they are aware of them, but maybe not the extent to which they hold them, then we get into some territory where nonverbals start to be maybe more meaningful than verbals because I don\u2019t realize that I have bias. I think that when you get into territory where either people don\u2019t have introspective access to how they think or feel or they have their incentivized not to reveal it, right? In an economic game or a strategic interaction or a negotiation, that\u2019s where nonverbal becomes really fun and interesting and useful because words aren\u2019t enough in that case."]},{"begin":"555.080","end":"586.320","lines":["Absolutely. Yeah. So they\u2019re both important and sometimes differentially important depending on the context, which again brings us back to this notion of context. So I have an example I always use when I teach. If you\u2019re in a doctor\u2019s office and the doctor says, how are you doing? That means one thing. If you\u2019re at a bar at a party and somebody says, how are you doing? That means something very different. The words are the same, the environment and context is different, and we somehow know how to navigate through that, but also we can run into a lot of trouble when we misunderstand."]},{"begin":"586.320","end":"640.600","lines":["[09:46]: Yes, and this is when knowing what our goal is is so incredibly important. If I\u2019m at that bar and my goal is I\u2019m attracted to this person and so I want to convey some attraction, so I might dip into some cues associated with attraction or being attractive. So when people use a breathier voice, they can come off as a little more attractive versus I\u2019m a doctor and my goal is empathy. I want you to know that I\u2019m listening. So the first thing you need to think about in a context is what\u2019s my goal here? If I\u2019m a doctor, I want to make sure that my patient feels heard and understood. If I\u2019m in a bar and I just truly want to know how someone\u2019s doing, I don\u2019t want to use a vocal tone that might express attraction, I might want to be more casual or upbeat like, Hey, how you doing?"]},{"begin":"640.600","end":"641.320","lines":["[10:39]"]},{"begin":"641.320","end":"692.280","lines":["Use colloquial tone of voice with a lot of vocal variability that might be associated with having a good time. So that\u2019s the first thing to do is what is my goal in this social interaction? And look, all of this stuff is happening in a fraction of a second, right? I mean, we don\u2019t sit down and script out what we\u2019re going to do before I\u2019m going to go to the barge, and when I see this person, I\u2019m going to say, I like to think about nonverbal communication as a language. Because once we kind of know what\u2019s the list of cues associated with liking, which ones of those are associated with platonic liking versus intimate liking, and when I do this one, oh gosh, I don\u2019t mean to be sending the wrong signal. So now not to do them and which behaviors are associated with being trusted, which behaviors are associated with conveying power?

And that\u2019s really, really important. This notion of there\u2019s a language and we have to understand and become fluent in that language, and some are more fluent than others, perhaps we have a time to talk about the people receiving that language. If I\u2019m at a bar and hope that you\u2019re signaling attraction to me, I\u2019m going to be looking for things in a way that I might not if I weren\u2019t the rose colored glasses, if you will, which I think is a separate conversation about our perception of nonverbals, not just our signaling of nonverbals"]},{"begin":"738.640","end":"770.640","lines":["[12:19]: Sometimes the nonverbal cues overlap, but if the audience takes one thing away from this conversation about nonverbal communication, it\u2019s that there are perception and expression and they\u2019re different, and also they overlap.

How can we learn about it? I ask my students to digitally record themselves as they practice. So they see their nonverbals and they watch it, and then they listen to it separately.

Am I trying to make new friends? Am I trying to do well in this negotiation? Am I trying to do well in this negotiation and retain friends? What\u2019s my goal? And then I watch that video or listen to the audio, and I try to assess whether I appropriately land it that way. At least did I think that I correctly sent the messages I intended to send?

And other people will see us and say like, oh, no, no, no. Let\u2019s say our faces tend to be a little cranky, and we know that we smiled three more times in that interaction. So for us, we\u2019re like, I was so nice in that interaction. I smiled three times. I never smile. So for us, we knew it was a big deviation from our baseline, and so we think we landed in a really warm positive way, but a stranger or another person with whom we interacted, if they were to watch and make ratings on those same dimensions, might give us a much lower score, which helps us assess, okay, so how I intended to land and whether or not I was successful, and then there was how did other people perceive that? And so that\u2019s the missing piece in that puzzle is how do other people perceive you?

And when we do that, we also have to think about how much does information does that other person have about us?

We talked about different channels of communication, the voice, the body, the face, but we haven\u2019t talked about consistency across those channels. I\u2019m looking for consistency across channels. If my face and my body and my voice and my words, if all of those things are saying the same thing, that makes me feel like that person is full in that way, I feel comfortable with them. Not only that they know what they\u2019re talking about and they know whatever they\u2019re saying is probably true. That is the thing that I pay attention to the most. And if people are inconsistent across channel, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something\u2019s awry, but it\u2019s something I pay attention to because it provides information about are they conflicted about what it is they\u2019re talking about."]},{"begin":"1055.200","end":"1084.720","lines":["[17:37]: I appreciate you sharing with us this notion of coherence because we\u2019ve really dissected nonverbal communication into these very specific parts, and we have to remember that there\u2019s a totality and whole that gets communicated and that we can assess that as well.

You have to know what your goal is. If you don\u2019t have clarity, at least a little bit of clarity about what your goal is, then you\u2019re not going to be very effective. So my goal today was just to be clear, I didn\u2019t quite know where we were going to go. I just knew that it was important for me to, whatever it was that I was going to get it across in a way that was at least a little bit succinct. Then knowing the nonverbal behaviors that land best for us, and that goes back to what we were talking about, the baseline knowing how we typically are so that we can figure out like, okay, I need to dial up the warmth. I don\u2019t come across warmly at all. Like, gosh, I kind of see mean I\u2019m not mean at all."]},{"begin":"1178.360","end":"1179.240","lines":["[19:40]"]},{"begin":"1179.240","end":"1268.520","lines":["It\u2019s not that you\u2019re trying to be something that you\u2019re not. It\u2019s that you are something, but it doesn\u2019t come across and you\u2019re like, oh gosh, how do I fix that? Right? And that\u2019s where your idea of practice. So then it\u2019s knowing which cues I can dabble in. There\u2019s a long list of immediacy cues that you can look at to try to practice and try on to figure out which one suits you the best, literally. And then what you said, practice, and it\u2019s not about faking it or not being authentic. It really is about, I am a nice person, or let\u2019s say you\u2019re not a nice person. Let\u2019s say you truly are not a nice person. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a cranky person, but there are sometimes that you\u2019re nice and let\u2019s say your goal is to be nice right now. So my advice is try to think about the times that you want to be nice or that you are nice or that you truly feel nice and say like, okay, what are the things that are most comfortable for me to do when I am being nice? And then tap into those behaviors because those are the ones that are comfortable for you. And then practice them, and they do in fact land the way you intend them to. So those are the ingredients. It\u2019s having a goal, knowing the best nonverbal behaviors that land what you\u2019re intending to land, and then practicing, right? Just making sure that you\u2019re doing them in an unconscious way, that you don\u2019t have to spend a whole lot of time thinking about it, that they\u2019re just automatically coming out of you."]},{"begin":"1268.520","end":"1283.080","lines":["[21:09]: So be clear on your goal.
