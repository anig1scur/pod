Many of us dread small talk, especially around the holidays. Yet I think small talk gets a bad rap. Lots of big things can happen during small talk. We can learn about others and ourselves. We can collaborate and we can set up future opportunities. Today we have a special episode for you. I worked with our friends at Harvard Business Review on a video called How to Get Good at Small Talk and Even Enjoy It, and it pulls together a lot of concepts that we dig into on Think Fast, talk Smart, the podcast and my new book, think Faster, talk Smarter. Let\u2019s listen in and enjoy. You can watch the video on Harvard Business Reviews YouTube channel and learn much more at HBR.org. Without further ado, here\u2019s how to get good at small talk."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Small talk, I think, is actually a misnomer. We refer to small talk as any chit chat or just conversation that we don\u2019t put a lot of import on when in fact small talk is a wonderful way of connecting, bonding, learning, growing. What makes it so challenging is the fact that we can\u2019t have a script. We have to just go with what\u2019s happening in the moment. We often think that it is a test for us. It\u2019s like a tennis match where I\u2019ve got to lob something over to the person or people I\u2019m talking to and I hope it lands and goes well. I think a better way to look at small talk is like that game of hacky sack, that little beanbag where everybody\u2019s trying to keep it up all at the same time and never have it hit the ground. If you envision your job as collaborating with others to keep the conversation moving rather than a hot potato tennis match where I just need to get it back to the other person, it can really change one, how it flows, and two, the experience from your perspective."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All of a sudden it\u2019s something that\u2019s enjoyable rather than something that\u2019s scary when you first get into a small talk situation. I think we need to establish appropriate goals. Rachel Greenwald, a matchmaker and an academic has this wonderful saying, your goal is to be interested, not interesting. A lot of us go into these situations thinking that we need to be really fascinating, engaging, and interesting when in fact we just need to be present and be interested in the conversation that\u2019s happening. It also helps reduce the anxiety. Many of us feel, we feel like we are being judged and the reality is you are being judged. You can reduce the intensity of that spotlight we feel by putting your attention on the other."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Many of us have this desire as soon as something spontaneous happens and we have to respond to do it as quickly as possible. We have this sense that speed to respond in somehow is associated with competence, but really what reflects best on your competence is an appropriate response, and appropriateness can take a little bit of time. We have all said something we didn\u2019t mean to say because it wasn\u2019t clear, it wasn\u2019t appropriate. Pausing helps reduce that likelihood, so here\u2019s some things you can do to help slow yourself down. Paraphrasing is wonderful. Why not? Just because you are repeating the gist of what somebody said to make sure you\u2019re clearly going to respond to what\u2019s asked or what\u2019s needed, but paraphrasing forces you to slow down and listen more carefully. Paraphrase isn\u2019t what a five-year-old does, who parrots back what you\u2019ve said. It\u2019s a distillation of what the other person said, and when you paraphrase it, you do several things."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One, you validate the other person because you\u2019re saying, I heard you. You\u2019re not necessarily agreeing. Paraphrasing doesn\u2019t mean agreement just means this is what I heard and it validates the content, so you validate the person, but the content, the person can say, no, no, no, no. What I really meant was this. So it helps with fidelity. Most of us listen just enough to get the gist of what somebody\u2019s saying, and then we immediately start judging, rehearsing and responding. When I paraphrase, I have to listen super intently. I have to listen to understand what\u2019s the bottom line of what you\u2019re saying. That slows me down and by slowing my own thoughts down and then paraphrasing them, I buy myself some time to really think there\u2019s always something to say. You can always ask a question. My mother-in-law was amazing at small talk. She had a black belt in small talk, and her superpower was a simple phrase."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"She would pause for a moment and she would say, tell me more. If you are ever in a situation, a communication conversation where you don\u2019t know what to say, most of the time you could simply say, tell me more, or give me some more detail, or What did you mean about that point? And just by giving the person an opportunity to speak again, that gives you time to find what you might want to say and to connect to it. Tell me more. When you say, tell me more, you have to act inquisitively. If you just say, tell me more. It\u2019s not, but if you say, tell me. Yeah, tell me more. Tell me more about that. Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mistakes are normal and natural in communication. We make them all the time. Spontaneous communication is about connection, not perfection. In film and TV, directors will ask their actors to have multiple takes. A take is just another shot at doing the same thing. So an actor might say something in one way very passionately, or they might say it in another way, being more curious. Those are all different takes. So I\u2019d like people to reframe a mistake as a missed take. What you did wasn\u2019t wrong, there might be another way to do it and we can try it again."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Many of us, when we feel very uncomfortable in spontaneous speaking situations, we go on too long. We are discovering what we\u2019re thinking as we\u2019re thinking it, so we just take people on the journey of our thought process as we\u2019re speaking and we keep going on and on and on. It\u2019s almost a defensive technique where if I just throw out a lot of stuff that maybe something will stick and people will think, oh, that person\u2019s smart, or they know what they\u2019re talking about. Concision is almost always better in communication. My mother has this wonderful saying, I know she didn\u2019t create it, but it\u2019s tell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock. Many of us are clock builders in these spontaneous speaking situations, and we have to remind ourselves when we start speaking, just tell the time. I know the irony that I\u2019m talking about concision, and I was not concise in that answer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One of the best ways to be concise and clear is to leverage structure. Structure is not a listing of ideas. It\u2019s not bullet points. Structure is a logical connection of your points. It\u2019s like a recipe or a map. Now, this sounds ironic, right? We\u2019re talking about being spontaneous, and here I am saying structure is the key to spontaneity, but we see this in our life in many other facets. If you enjoy jazz music, jazz music isn\u2019t just random playing jazz. Music follows particular structures, chord progressions, connections of notes, so we can leverage structure to help our communication be tighter and clearer. One of my favorite structures of all time, because it\u2019s so useful in so many different situations is three simple questions. What? So what now is your idea, your product, your service, your belief, the So why is it important to the person or people you\u2019re talking to?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And the now, what comes next? Maybe I\u2019m going to show you something, take your questions, set up another appointment. When it comes to small talk, this is a magical tool. Imagine you\u2019re at a corporate mixer and you\u2019re going in and there are people in the company that you have not yet met. So if I\u2019m engaging you in conversation, I could say, Hey, what brings you here? That\u2019s the what. When you answer, I could say, oh, why is that important or Why do you find that interesting? That\u2019s the so what. And then after that I can ask a question like, oh, so what more are you going to do? Or What are you going to do next? Or Do you want to join me and go over here? So I\u2019ve got the now what is a question? As with anything that you\u2019re trying to learn, you have to practice it. When you read something or listen to a podcast, pause it, stop your reading. Think, what was it about? Why is it important to me and how can I use it? By drilling, it becomes more natural."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"When we\u2019re in small talk situations, we often initiate with trite very common phrases, how are you? What brings you here? What do you do? These are simple, reflexive ways to get started, but they actually don\u2019t take you very far. I am a big fan of initiating through questions, but through questions that connect to the particular context and environment that I\u2019m in. Just the other day, I was in a situation for small talk, and the very first thing I did, I came up to somebody I didn\u2019t know and I said, this is amazing to me. There are more people in this room wearing blue shirts than I think I\u2019ve seen in a long time, and the person said, you know what? You\u2019re right. That\u2019s really interesting. And all of a sudden the conversation was off and running. All I did was notice something in the environment. Initiating with something that piques somebody\u2019s curiosity, something that might be highlighting something that\u2019s not known or commonly discussed in the moment can really invite people in versus, hi, how are you? And they say, fine. Well, now I\u2019m back to where I started, and it\u2019s even more awkward, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Perhaps more challenging than initiating small talk is getting out of small talk. Many of us rely on biology, oh, I\u2019m thirsty. I\u2019m going to go get a drink. I\u2019m hungry, or I need to go to the bathroom. Biology is not necessarily the best exit for these circumstances. I love an approach I learned from Rachel Greenwald. It\u2019s called the White Flag Approach. If you know anything about auto racing prior to the last lap, the final lap, they wave a white flag to signal to all the drivers that the race is ending. As you\u2019re drawing near to the end of the conversation, either because you need to leave, you want to leave, or the conversation is sort of run its course, you signal that you say, I need to go in a moment, and this is where you ask one last question, provide one bit of feedback so you\u2019ve continued the conversation on for a little bit, so it might sound something like this, I need to get going because some friends over there I need to meet, but before I go, I want to know just a little bit more about that trip you were telling me about to Hawaii, and together you can draw the conversation to an end rather than you abruptly saying, oh, I need to go to the bathroom, or, wow, that looks like good food over there."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s just a much better, cleaner way to end a small talk conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I hope you now have some ideas you can put into practice right away about how to be better at small talk.

Matt here. Many of us dread small talk, especially around the holidays. Yet I think small talk gets a bad rap. Lots of big things can happen during small talk. We can learn about others and ourselves. We can collaborate and we can set up future opportunities. Today we have a special episode for you. I worked with our friends at Harvard Business Review on a video called How to Get Good at Small Talk and Even Enjoy It, and it pulls together a lot of concepts that we dig into on Think Fast, talk Smart, the podcast and my new book, think Faster, talk Smarter. Let\u2019s listen in and enjoy. You can watch the video on Harvard Business Reviews YouTube channel and learn much more at HBR.org. Without further ado, here\u2019s how to get good at small talk."]},{"begin":"50.320","end":"108.840","lines":["Small talk, I think, is actually a misnomer. We refer to small talk as any chit chat or just conversation that we don\u2019t put a lot of import on when in fact small talk is a wonderful way of connecting, bonding, learning, growing. What makes it so challenging is the fact that we can\u2019t have a script. We have to just go with what\u2019s happening in the moment. We often think that it is a test for us. It\u2019s like a tennis match where I\u2019ve got to lob something over to the person or people I\u2019m talking to and I hope it lands and goes well. I think a better way to look at small talk is like that game of hacky sack, that little beanbag where everybody\u2019s trying to keep it up all at the same time and never have it hit the ground. If you envision your job as collaborating with others to keep the conversation moving rather than a hot potato tennis match where I just need to get it back to the other person, it can really change one, how it flows, and two, the experience from your perspective."]},{"begin":"108.840","end":"155.480","lines":["All of a sudden it\u2019s something that\u2019s enjoyable rather than something that\u2019s scary when you first get into a small talk situation. I think we need to establish appropriate goals. Rachel Greenwald, a matchmaker and an academic has this wonderful saying, your goal is to be interested, not interesting. A lot of us go into these situations thinking that we need to be really fascinating, engaging, and interesting when in fact we just need to be present and be interested in the conversation that\u2019s happening. It also helps reduce the anxiety. Many of us feel, we feel like we are being judged and the reality is you are being judged. You can reduce the intensity of that spotlight we feel by putting your attention on the other."]},{"begin":"155.480","end":"212.520","lines":["Many of us have this desire as soon as something spontaneous happens and we have to respond to do it as quickly as possible. We have this sense that speed to respond in somehow is associated with competence, but really what reflects best on your competence is an appropriate response, and appropriateness can take a little bit of time. We have all said something we didn\u2019t mean to say because it wasn\u2019t clear, it wasn\u2019t appropriate. Pausing helps reduce that likelihood, so here\u2019s some things you can do to help slow yourself down. Paraphrasing is wonderful. Why not? Just because you are repeating the gist of what somebody said to make sure you\u2019re clearly going to respond to what\u2019s asked or what\u2019s needed, but paraphrasing forces you to slow down and listen more carefully. Paraphrase isn\u2019t what a five-year-old does, who parrots back what you\u2019ve said. It\u2019s a distillation of what the other person said, and when you paraphrase it, you do several things."]},{"begin":"212.520","end":"265.560","lines":["One, you validate the other person because you\u2019re saying, I heard you. You\u2019re not necessarily agreeing. Paraphrasing doesn\u2019t mean agreement just means this is what I heard and it validates the content, so you validate the person, but the content, the person can say, no, no, no, no. What I really meant was this. So it helps with fidelity. Most of us listen just enough to get the gist of what somebody\u2019s saying, and then we immediately start judging, rehearsing and responding. When I paraphrase, I have to listen super intently. I have to listen to understand what\u2019s the bottom line of what you\u2019re saying. That slows me down and by slowing my own thoughts down and then paraphrasing them, I buy myself some time to really think there\u2019s always something to say. You can always ask a question. My mother-in-law was amazing at small talk. She had a black belt in small talk, and her superpower was a simple phrase."]},{"begin":"265.560","end":"299.360","lines":["She would pause for a moment and she would say, tell me more. If you are ever in a situation, a communication conversation where you don\u2019t know what to say, most of the time you could simply say, tell me more, or give me some more detail, or What did you mean about that point? And just by giving the person an opportunity to speak again, that gives you time to find what you might want to say and to connect to it. Tell me more. When you say, tell me more, you have to act inquisitively. If you just say, tell me more. It\u2019s not, but if you say, tell me. Yeah, tell me more. Tell me more about that. Yeah."]},{"begin":"299.360","end":"340.440","lines":["Mistakes are normal and natural in communication. We make them all the time. Spontaneous communication is about connection, not perfection. In film and TV, directors will ask their actors to have multiple takes. A take is just another shot at doing the same thing. So an actor might say something in one way very passionately, or they might say it in another way, being more curious. Those are all different takes. So I\u2019d like people to reframe a mistake as a missed take. What you did wasn\u2019t wrong, there might be another way to do it and we can try it again."]},{"begin":"340.440","end":"392.520","lines":["Many of us, when we feel very uncomfortable in spontaneous speaking situations, we go on too long. We are discovering what we\u2019re thinking as we\u2019re thinking it, so we just take people on the journey of our thought process as we\u2019re speaking and we keep going on and on and on. It\u2019s almost a defensive technique where if I just throw out a lot of stuff that maybe something will stick and people will think, oh, that person\u2019s smart, or they know what they\u2019re talking about. Concision is almost always better in communication. My mother has this wonderful saying, I know she didn\u2019t create it, but it\u2019s tell me the time. Don\u2019t build me the clock. Many of us are clock builders in these spontaneous speaking situations, and we have to remind ourselves when we start speaking, just tell the time. I know the irony that I\u2019m talking about concision, and I was not concise in that answer."]},{"begin":"392.520","end":"449.120","lines":["One of the best ways to be concise and clear is to leverage structure. Structure is not a listing of ideas. It\u2019s not bullet points. Structure is a logical connection of your points. It\u2019s like a recipe or a map. Now, this sounds ironic, right? We\u2019re talking about being spontaneous, and here I am saying structure is the key to spontaneity, but we see this in our life in many other facets. If you enjoy jazz music, jazz music isn\u2019t just random playing jazz. Music follows particular structures, chord progressions, connections of notes, so we can leverage structure to help our communication be tighter and clearer. One of my favorite structures of all time, because it\u2019s so useful in so many different situations is three simple questions. What? So what now is your idea, your product, your service, your belief, the So why is it important to the person or people you\u2019re talking to?"]},{"begin":"449.120","end":"498.080","lines":["And the now, what comes next? Maybe I\u2019m going to show you something, take your questions, set up another appointment. When it comes to small talk, this is a magical tool. Imagine you\u2019re at a corporate mixer and you\u2019re going in and there are people in the company that you have not yet met. So if I\u2019m engaging you in conversation, I could say, Hey, what brings you here? That\u2019s the what. When you answer, I could say, oh, why is that important or Why do you find that interesting? That\u2019s the so what. And then after that I can ask a question like, oh, so what more are you going to do? Or What are you going to do next? Or Do you want to join me and go over here? So I\u2019ve got the now what is a question? As with anything that you\u2019re trying to learn, you have to practice it. When you read something or listen to a podcast, pause it, stop your reading. Think, what was it about? Why is it important to me and how can I use it? By drilling, it becomes more natural."]},{"begin":"498.080","end":"562.280","lines":["When we\u2019re in small talk situations, we often initiate with trite very common phrases, how are you? What brings you here? What do you do? These are simple, reflexive ways to get started, but they actually don\u2019t take you very far. I am a big fan of initiating through questions, but through questions that connect to the particular context and environment that I\u2019m in. Just the other day, I was in a situation for small talk, and the very first thing I did, I came up to somebody I didn\u2019t know and I said, this is amazing to me. There are more people in this room wearing blue shirts than I think I\u2019ve seen in a long time, and the person said, you know what? You\u2019re right. That\u2019s really interesting. And all of a sudden the conversation was off and running. All I did was notice something in the environment. Initiating with something that piques somebody\u2019s curiosity, something that might be highlighting something that\u2019s not known or commonly discussed in the moment can really invite people in versus, hi, how are you? And they say, fine. Well, now I\u2019m back to where I started, and it\u2019s even more awkward, right?"]},{"begin":"562.280","end":"628.440","lines":["Perhaps more challenging than initiating small talk is getting out of small talk. Many of us rely on biology, oh, I\u2019m thirsty. I\u2019m going to go get a drink. I\u2019m hungry, or I need to go to the bathroom. Biology is not necessarily the best exit for these circumstances. I love an approach I learned from Rachel Greenwald. It\u2019s called the White Flag Approach. If you know anything about auto racing prior to the last lap, the final lap, they wave a white flag to signal to all the drivers that the race is ending. As you\u2019re drawing near to the end of the conversation, either because you need to leave, you want to leave, or the conversation is sort of run its course, you signal that you say, I need to go in a moment, and this is where you ask one last question, provide one bit of feedback so you\u2019ve continued the conversation on for a little bit, so it might sound something like this, I need to get going because some friends over there I need to meet, but before I go, I want to know just a little bit more about that trip you were telling me about to Hawaii, and together you can draw the conversation to an end rather than you abruptly saying, oh, I need to go to the bathroom, or, wow, that looks like good food over there."]},{"begin":"628.440","end":"634.400","lines":["It\u2019s just a much better, cleaner way to end a small talk conversation."]},{"begin":"634.400","end":"670.640","lines":["I hope you now have some ideas you can put into practice right away about how to be better at small talk.
