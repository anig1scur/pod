Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:00:17] Today, I\u2019m excited to speak with Linda Hill. Linda is a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Her research focuses on leadership development, building agile, innovative organizations and implementing global strategies. Linda is also the author of three important and popular books, Becoming a Manager, Collective Genius: The Art and Practice of Leading Innovation and Being the Boss and The 3 Imperatives of Becoming a Great Leader."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Linda, thanks for being here and thanks to our friends at HBR for allowing us to record in their studio."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"It\u2019s a real pleasure to be with you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:00:53]: Excellent. I look forward to our conversation. Up for getting started?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Yes, I am."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. I find your research really interesting and important. One outcome of your work is your distinction between leading for innovation and leading for change. Can you help us understand the difference between the two?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Yes, I\u2019d be glad to. So I am a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John Cotter and Warren Bennis. And they taught us that leadership was about dealing with change or coping with change. So leadership was about, if you will, coming up with a vision, communicating that vision, and inspiring people to want to fulfill that vision."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:01:25] I always thought that was leadership. I went out and talked to people who were exceptional leaders of innovation, individuals who had built teams, organizations, or even ecosystems that were able to routinely innovate. And when I asked them, what do they do? What is leadership about? A few of them said to me, well, you know what? I don\u2019t even read leadership books because they immediately say you\u2019re supposed to have a vision."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"But you know what? When you\u2019re trying to do breakthrough innovation, you have no vision. You don\u2019t know the answer. The only reason I took this job is I have no vision. Now that is actually not completely accurate because everyone that I\u2019ve studied, who\u2019s really good at this, was a visionary. But they also understood that innovation was not about an individual coming up with an idea or a new idea. Instead, innovation is the result normally of the collaboration of people with diverse expertise and diverse perspectives coming together, being able to collaborate, being able to experiment together and learn as quickly as they can to come up with a solution to some problem or some opportunity."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So it turns out that leading innovation, as one of them put it, is the following. It is not about saying to people, I have a vision, follow me to the future. Instead, it\u2019s about saying, let me create an environment in which a group of us will be willing and able to co-create that future together."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:02:38]: I find this really, really fascinating. Can you explain for us some of the components that go into that culture of innovation or that environment that allows for that innovation to happen? And what role does communication play in that?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Communication plays a very important role. It turns out, that if in fact you want to build a group that can co create the future together, what you need to think about is what does innovation really require? First, it requires that we can collaborate, and we can collaborate even though we\u2019re different."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:03:09] Second, it requires that we actually know how to experiment and learn together. We can iterate and go through that whole process where there are going to be, in fact, missteps and mistakes, failures, in fact. And third, it requires that we actually can utilize all of our talents and passions, the whole groups. And the final thing is that, it turns out, that innovation can be fun and exhilarating, but mostly it\u2019s emotionally and intellectually very challenging. So that\u2019s reality of what innovation is about."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:03:40] So if you want a group to be able to innovate time and again, what you need to be able to do is first make sure they\u2019re willing. How you make sure they\u2019re willing is really about your culture. Unless I feel a part of a community and we have some sense of shared purpose, then I don\u2019t really want to take the risks associated and do that hard work, that intellectual, emotionally hard work with you to try to come up with something new."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:04:01] So the first thing about the culture is there is this sense of shared purpose, there is a why. If you don\u2019t have that purpose, then I don\u2019t have a sense of belonging to a community I care about. Now, also what we need to do is we need to have in our community a set of shared values that are consistent with our collaborating, experimenting, and learning together, and taking care of each other because it is such hard work."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So there are a set of values that we see in most of these organizations. And finally, related to those values are rules of engagement, how we\u2019re supposed to be together. Now, often these are implicit, but what we see in these organizations is that the leaders make them more explicit. So that we, in fact, need to communicate in various ways that this is what really matters to us, this is what we value, and this is how we behave."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And in terms of behavior, there are two, two sort of areas of concern. One is how we\u2019re going to interact together. We\u2019re going to have mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual influence, all easy words to say, very difficult to live. The other set of rules of engagement are really about how we\u2019re going to think together because innovation is really a kind of problem solving."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And so the rules about how we\u2019re going to think together are, you know what, you need to tell people what your evidence is. Your evidence can be your gut, but admit it. Just say, it\u2019s my gut. Now, with AI, with data, whatever it is, say these are the data. Well, okay, you can tell me this is what I believe and this is why, and you have to provide the evidence, that\u2019s the rule."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:05:23] And the second piece is that I can still question you. So you may say to me, everybody can question anybody. You may say, this is what I believe and it\u2019s because of all my experience. And I can say to you, hmm, is your experience relevant to what we\u2019re doing right now, even if I\u2019m a junior person? And then the last rule of engagement about how we\u2019re supposed to think together really is that we\u2019re supposed to think holistically."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So you can say, you know what, I get it, I agree. But I don\u2019t think my part of the organization can do it. And if we think about what the whole enterprise or what all of us have to contribute for this to happen. Can we spend a little bit more time thinking about a solution that actually might allow my function or my geography to participate in the way you\u2019d like?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:06:04]: So clearly communication plays a really important role in establishing a culture and environment where innovation can thrive. We have to be focused on shared purpose, shared values, and thank you for articulating the rules of engagement. I\u2019m curious if you can give us a little more detail about shared values."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So shared values, there are four shared values and obviously each organization has its own culture, but we did see these values in all of them. The first is bold ambition. These are organizations where people aren\u2019t thinking about just what they should be doing but what they could be doing and that bold ambition is what makes it worthwhile for us to even bother to innovate if it\u2019s not a big enough idea."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And so this is a place where communication really matters because if you want people to take on bold ambitions. You need to frame it in a way that is inspiring, that actually captures their attention. The second value is collaboration. The third is learning. And the fourth is responsibility. That is, people feel responsible to deliver and do their part to contribute to whatever that shared purpose is."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:07:02]: Those values certainly can drive innovation and I think just drive a healthy organization in general. I\u2019m curious to talk about purpose, can you help me understand the difference between vision and purpose? Because I can see some people using those words almost synonymously."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So vision is about where we\u2019re going and purpose is about why we\u2019re going there. And as it turns out. This issue of why we\u2019re going there is what really creates that sense of community. And I think why I heard from many people who are really good at innovation is they don\u2019t have the vision. Well, they don\u2019t have the answer, but they do know what the question is and why it\u2019s an important question."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So purpose can also be about who we serve. So I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on digital transformation, and it turns out that in terms of communication, and the reason why you often want to put in digital tools is so that you can be more agile and you can innovate for your customer. Well, it turns out that if you want people again to really take up and adopt and use data, use digital tools, I find that unless you start with purpose, the why, and you can tell a story, a narrative that is a customer centric narrative about why we should be doing this and why this is going to help the customer, people aren\u2019t willing to adopt those tools, that technology, because it\u2019s really hard to do it for many people. It\u2019s not easy to learn how to do things very differently unless they get the why. And they buy into that, then they\u2019re not going to want to do what you want them to do. Because again, going back to innovation, you cannot tell someone to innovate. You can only invite them. So communication becomes very important because it\u2019s an invitation. It\u2019s not about, you know, you can\u2019t say, I\u2019m the boss. You will innovate. That is useless. You can only invite them. This is why the willing is an important piece of the puzzle. So how do we write invitations or send invitations to people? We think about that a lot when we\u2019re doing a party or whatever we\u2019re going to do. So when you\u2019re trying to invite someone to do something that\u2019s really going to be very hard, you have to understand why."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And the only way you\u2019re going to get what you need out of them is if they share with them what we refer to as their slice of genius. Everybody has a slice of genius. Everyone has talents. Everyone has passions. And what you\u2019re trying to do in your communication is help tap into what their talents and passions are, connect them to some collective good, and help them understand the connection between the two."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:09:17] So purpose, the why, is where the alignment comes. It\u2019s not about where we\u2019re going, because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going. So how you help people understand that and tell a story where they see, yeah, I care about that and I see why you need me to give my all, my slice of genius to help do this collective thing we want to do, since the book is called Collective Genius. The concept of Slice of Genius came from the work I did at Pixar. And they talk about everybody having a slice of genius, and when we were thinking about what should we call our book, we felt that Collective Genius was the only thing we could do."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:09:53]: I love that storytelling is a critical component in innovation and declaring purpose. And purpose is really about the why and the sense of urgency. And we talk often on this podcast about knowing your audience when you communicate, when you tell stories. And I love your language around slice of genius. What that really is to my mind, to my ear is that you\u2019re looking to understand the value that people bring, the unique value. And that\u2019s really understanding who you\u2019re speaking to. So innovation boils down to, in many ways, the ability to align and motivate people behind the why. And storytelling helps you do that."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Yes, indeed, you\u2019re right. And I would say that there are capabilities that need to be in place once you have inspired people, the willing part of it. But you also have to help them be able."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:10:43]: Since we\u2019re sitting in HBR\u2019s studio, I wanted to highlight an article that you wrote. And in it, you talk about the importance of collaboration, but you also talk about the importance of conflict. And I\u2019d love for you to talk about the value of conflict in these processes, because I think so many people listening, and myself included are conflict averse, we feel conflict is bad and I think you have a very different perspective on it that I\u2019d love for you to share."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"This idea of innovation being the result of a collaboration is not the result of my work. There\u2019s a whole history of that. What we did in our work is look at the connection between leadership and innovation because as it turns out, most people who study innovation are either economists or macro sociologists so they don\u2019t really care as much about what the individual leader needs to do and this is how we discovered we needed to talk a lot more about conflict. And what we saw in our work when we looked at organizations that were very innovative is, yeah, we know we need to collaborate, as I told you, but what\u2019s the real test of collaboration? And that is whether or not you can take advantage of all the diversity of thought you need to get that innovative solution."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:11:45] So when you have diversity of thought, by definition, you have the potential for conflict. So if you cannot deal with conflict, then you\u2019re either going to compromise, a lowest common denominator, or you\u2019re going to let one group dominate. So the capabilities really are about how we actually use our diversity of thought in a constructive way and come up with innovative solutions."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:12:07] So the first one is creative abrasion. If you want to have an innovative solution, you as a leader actually want to amplify the differences that are happening, not minimize them. And once they\u2019re amplified, if people are talented and passionate, guess what? There\u2019s going to be a little bit of tussle. And if you are not comfortable as a leader allowing for that tussle, then you\u2019re not going to get the full advantage of that diversity of thought, you\u2019re going to cut somebody off."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:12:33] The second one is about creative agility and that is, can we experiment and learn together because you cannot really plan your way to an innovation, you have to act your way to an innovation. So I\u2019m not surprised. Agile methodologies, lean start-up, design thinking, all of that stuff, that is really about how you experiment and learn as efficiently as you can."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:12:54] The last capability, which goes to why communication becomes very important too, is creative resolution. And that is about how we make a decision. So we have our tussle and we have our conflict, we might start experimenting and all along the way we have to make various decisions, do we go this way or that way."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And that\u2019s what creative resolution is about. What you see in organizations that are very innovative is that people do not compromise, do not go along to get along. They also don\u2019t let one group dominate. They don\u2019t let the bosses dominate and they don\u2019t let the experts dominate. And the experts are a real challenge when you\u2019re trying to do something new."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And the final thing is, instead they have a more patient and inclusive way of allowing the voices to be heard. And that means working through things. So we all need to be communicating as effectively as we can."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:13:42]: So much in what you just said, the value of conflict is that it provides a diversity of opinions and it allows for more creative solutions and innovation to arise. But you have to set up an infrastructure, a way of being that allows for that to happen. And we have to be very clear on making sure that everybody can contribute to that conversation, be it collaborative and, or conflictual. And we have to be very clear on who makes those decisions. I want to move to something that personally is fascinating and something we visited a lot on this podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You talk about six dilemmas for innovative change. One of them has to do with a tension that we\u2019ve often talked about, which is the struggle between structure and improvisation. Can you elaborate on this dialectic and how it helps in innovation?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"[00:14:30]: So there are these six dilemmas, or paradoxes, that must be managed as you\u2019re trying to innovate. And whether or not your team develops those capabilities relates to your capacity as a leader to deal with those six dilemmas. One of them is in fact, improvisation and structure. So it turns out that the six are laid out in a way that when you\u2019re behaving on one side, you\u2019re actually unleashing people\u2019s slices of genius, you\u2019re amplifying. When you\u2019re playing on the other side, you\u2019re harnessing or leveraging them for the collective good. So on the one side for unleashing, which is very consistent with the kinds of conditions that my colleague Amy Edmondson says you need for psychological safety, is you\u2019re going to have to improvise."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"If you want that individual to be able to do his best work, or her best work, you may have to do things a little differently and create the circumstances that fit them and the way they do their best work. It may be different for them than me. On the other hand, when you\u2019re trying to leverage and get to the collective good, you got to put some structures in place."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So you do want to have structures in place. You want to have the least amount of structure you need, but structures that help us either collaborate, experiment, or learn. And if the structures aren\u2019t helping us with those three things, then that sort of bureaucracy has a purpose. But if it\u2019s not about that, then we don\u2019t need it. So hierarchy does matter. It is helpful for us to know what the hierarchy is and what the roles are because it just lets us be more agile, to be quick. I don\u2019t have to ask you every time, what\u2019s your job, et cetera. So the structures that you put in place are in support of our being able to collaborate, experiment, learn together, make decisions in the creative resolution kind of way."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:16:06]: You\u2019re echoing a conversation we\u2019ve had often about the value of structure. Having a minimal structure enables the creativity. If you don\u2019t have the structure, the hierarchy in place, you could have anarchy and you could have confusion. So structure enables, supports, and allows people to be creative and innovative."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And we\u2019ve talked about it often in spontaneous communication moments when I have to answer a question, give feedback. And what you\u2019re sharing is this works at a collective level, and that\u2019s really important. Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you three questions. One I create just for you and the other two are similar to everyone I interview. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Oh dear, yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:16:49]: You are incredibly collaborative as a researcher and as an author. What practices do you put in place to foster that collaborative work you do with others? How do you enable it?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"First, I make sure there is diversity of thought. And the last two books that I have written, I\u2019m working on one right now, I always have an author who, at least when they\u2019ve been she\u2019s, she starts with me, she\u2019s under the age of twenty-five. And I like strong willed people. I always pick people who have a point of view. And who I find are pretty talented, but they\u2019re younger than me. That they\u2019re old souls, it turns out all of them, I think. But fundamentally they will take me on. I pick people that I really am going to learn from and I enjoy, and are outspoken."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:17:38]: I like that you think about the quality of the communication you have. And I really like that you seek out different opinions. Question number two, who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"One I have on my mind just at the moment is Vineet Nayar. I don\u2019t know that you would know his name or not. He was the CEO of HCL Technologies. And HCL Technologies was the company that started the computer business in India, but it lost its way. He\u2019s an unbelievable communicator. He wrote a book called Employees First, Customers Second. The reason why he\u2019s such a good communicator is his language is so visual and so colorful. It\u2019s about communicating in simple but vibrant ways. And I highly recommend you look up Employees First, Customer Second, or anything that Vineet has written or said."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:18:30]: So what I\u2019m hearing that makes him such a powerful communicator is that he\u2019s able to paint a picture with the words. Final question, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"The first, I would say is there\u2019s something about it that is provocative, that gets your attention. It really raises a question and you\u2019re really eager to hear how that question is going to be answered. I think the other thing is that you do in fact know your audience. You\u2019re empathic enough to know this is the way I need to come at this with this particular group of people, because this is the kind of thing they care about."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"So I think you do take the time to know your audience. I think the other thing about communication, when you\u2019re communicating, you are trying to engage someone\u2019s head and someone\u2019s heart. And to the extent that you can think about both when you\u2019re communicating with them, the communication is going to be more powerful."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"And I think we all meet people that can do the head piece of it very well, and we\u2019re impressed and we get it, but then afterwards we don\u2019t remember much of it. And then we meet people who do the heart and sometimes you think about a little bit more was, what was the there there, but you kind of remember it more. And so when you can get that combination of both, I think that\u2019s when the communication has been quite powerful, which is why storytelling is important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:19:45]: Creating curiosity by being provocative, really knowing your audience and being able to balance and give importance to the heart and the feeling, not just the information. Absolutely key ingredients to a successful communication recipe."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Linda, thank you so much. Your insight and input into innovation, into how we can build cultures and support that innovation are really, really helpful. And your insights into what makes for good stories and good facilitation and managing conflict very, very useful for all of us. I appreciate your time. Thank you for joining us."},{"author":"Linda Hill","text":"Well, thank you.

I look forward to our conversation. Up for getting started?"]},{"begin":"56.280","end":"57.160","lines":["Yes, I am."]},{"begin":"57.160","end":"70.240","lines":["All right. I find your research really interesting and important. One outcome of your work is your distinction between leading for innovation and leading for change. Can you help us understand the difference between the two?"]},{"begin":"70.240","end":"85.400","lines":["Yes, I\u2019d be glad to. So I am a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John Cotter and Warren Bennis. And they taught us that leadership was about dealing with change or coping with change. So leadership was about, if you will, coming up with a vision, communicating that vision, and inspiring people to want to fulfill that vision."]},{"begin":"85.400","end":"86.840","lines":["[00:01:25]"]},{"begin":"86.840","end":"106.560","lines":["I always thought that was leadership. I went out and talked to people who were exceptional leaders of innovation, individuals who had built teams, organizations, or even ecosystems that were able to routinely innovate. And when I asked them, what do they do? What is leadership about? A few of them said to me, well, you know what? I don\u2019t even read leadership books because they immediately say you\u2019re supposed to have a vision."]},{"begin":"106.560","end":"143.000","lines":["But you know what? When you\u2019re trying to do breakthrough innovation, you have no vision. You don\u2019t know the answer. The only reason I took this job is I have no vision. Now that is actually not completely accurate because everyone that I\u2019ve studied, who\u2019s really good at this, was a visionary. But they also understood that innovation was not about an individual coming up with an idea or a new idea. Instead, innovation is the result normally of the collaboration of people with diverse expertise and diverse perspectives coming together, being able to collaborate, being able to experiment together and learn as quickly as they can to come up with a solution to some problem or some opportunity."]},{"begin":"143.000","end":"158.080","lines":["So it turns out that leading innovation, as one of them put it, is the following. It is not about saying to people, I have a vision, follow me to the future. Instead, it\u2019s about saying, let me create an environment in which a group of us will be willing and able to co-create that future together."]},{"begin":"158.080","end":"172.760","lines":["[00:02:38]: I find this really, really fascinating. Can you explain for us some of the components that go into that culture of innovation or that environment that allows for that innovation to happen? And what role does communication play in that?"]},{"begin":"172.760","end":"189.320","lines":["Communication plays a very important role. It turns out, that if in fact you want to build a group that can co create the future together, what you need to think about is what does innovation really require? First, it requires that we can collaborate, and we can collaborate even though we\u2019re different."]},{"begin":"189.320","end":"189.880","lines":["[00:03:09]"]},{"begin":"189.880","end":"218.800","lines":["Second, it requires that we actually know how to experiment and learn together. We can iterate and go through that whole process where there are going to be, in fact, missteps and mistakes, failures, in fact. And third, it requires that we actually can utilize all of our talents and passions, the whole groups. And the final thing is that, it turns out, that innovation can be fun and exhilarating, but mostly it\u2019s emotionally and intellectually very challenging. So that\u2019s reality of what innovation is about."]},{"begin":"218.800","end":"220.240","lines":["[00:03:40]"]},{"begin":"220.240","end":"241.040","lines":["So if you want a group to be able to innovate time and again, what you need to be able to do is first make sure they\u2019re willing. How you make sure they\u2019re willing is really about your culture. Unless I feel a part of a community and we have some sense of shared purpose, then I don\u2019t really want to take the risks associated and do that hard work, that intellectual, emotionally hard work with you to try to come up with something new."]},{"begin":"241.040","end":"241.720","lines":["[00:04:01]"]},{"begin":"241.720","end":"261.600","lines":["So the first thing about the culture is there is this sense of shared purpose, there is a why. If you don\u2019t have that purpose, then I don\u2019t have a sense of belonging to a community I care about. Now, also what we need to do is we need to have in our community a set of shared values that are consistent with our collaborating, experimenting, and learning together, and taking care of each other because it is such hard work."]},{"begin":"261.600","end":"283.640","lines":["So there are a set of values that we see in most of these organizations. And finally, related to those values are rules of engagement, how we\u2019re supposed to be together. Now, often these are implicit, but what we see in these organizations is that the leaders make them more explicit. So that we, in fact, need to communicate in various ways that this is what really matters to us, this is what we value, and this is how we behave."]},{"begin":"283.640","end":"303.520","lines":["And in terms of behavior, there are two, two sort of areas of concern. One is how we\u2019re going to interact together. We\u2019re going to have mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual influence, all easy words to say, very difficult to live. The other set of rules of engagement are really about how we\u2019re going to think together because innovation is really a kind of problem solving."]},{"begin":"303.520","end":"322.560","lines":["And so the rules about how we\u2019re going to think together are, you know what, you need to tell people what your evidence is. Your evidence can be your gut, but admit it. Just say, it\u2019s my gut. Now, with AI, with data, whatever it is, say these are the data. Well, okay, you can tell me this is what I believe and this is why, and you have to provide the evidence, that\u2019s the rule."]},{"begin":"322.560","end":"323.680","lines":["[00:05:23]"]},{"begin":"323.680","end":"345.600","lines":["And the second piece is that I can still question you. So you may say to me, everybody can question anybody. You may say, this is what I believe and it\u2019s because of all my experience. And I can say to you, hmm, is your experience relevant to what we\u2019re doing right now, even if I\u2019m a junior person? And then the last rule of engagement about how we\u2019re supposed to think together really is that we\u2019re supposed to think holistically."]},{"begin":"345.600","end":"363.400","lines":["So you can say, you know what, I get it, I agree. But I don\u2019t think my part of the organization can do it. And if we think about what the whole enterprise or what all of us have to contribute for this to happen. Can we spend a little bit more time thinking about a solution that actually might allow my function or my geography to participate in the way you\u2019d like?"]},{"begin":"363.400","end":"382.000","lines":["[00:06:04]: So clearly communication plays a really important role in establishing a culture and environment where innovation can thrive. We have to be focused on shared purpose, shared values, and thank you for articulating the rules of engagement. I\u2019m curious if you can give us a little more detail about shared values."]},{"begin":"382.000","end":"400.840","lines":["So shared values, there are four shared values and obviously each organization has its own culture, but we did see these values in all of them. The first is bold ambition. These are organizations where people aren\u2019t thinking about just what they should be doing but what they could be doing and that bold ambition is what makes it worthwhile for us to even bother to innovate if it\u2019s not a big enough idea."]},{"begin":"400.840","end":"422.240","lines":["And so this is a place where communication really matters because if you want people to take on bold ambitions. You need to frame it in a way that is inspiring, that actually captures their attention. The second value is collaboration. The third is learning. And the fourth is responsibility. That is, people feel responsible to deliver and do their part to contribute to whatever that shared purpose is."]},{"begin":"422.240","end":"437.520","lines":["[00:07:02]: Those values certainly can drive innovation and I think just drive a healthy organization in general. I\u2019m curious to talk about purpose, can you help me understand the difference between vision and purpose? Because I can see some people using those words almost synonymously."]},{"begin":"437.520","end":"458.840","lines":["So vision is about where we\u2019re going and purpose is about why we\u2019re going there. And as it turns out. This issue of why we\u2019re going there is what really creates that sense of community. And I think why I heard from many people who are really good at innovation is they don\u2019t have the vision. Well, they don\u2019t have the answer, but they do know what the question is and why it\u2019s an important question."]},{"begin":"458.840","end":"536.640","lines":["So purpose can also be about who we serve. So I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on digital transformation, and it turns out that in terms of communication, and the reason why you often want to put in digital tools is so that you can be more agile and you can innovate for your customer. Well, it turns out that if you want people again to really take up and adopt and use data, use digital tools, I find that unless you start with purpose, the why, and you can tell a story, a narrative that is a customer centric narrative about why we should be doing this and why this is going to help the customer, people aren\u2019t willing to adopt those tools, that technology, because it\u2019s really hard to do it for many people. It\u2019s not easy to learn how to do things very differently unless they get the why. And they buy into that, then they\u2019re not going to want to do what you want them to do. Because again, going back to innovation, you cannot tell someone to innovate. You can only invite them. So communication becomes very important because it\u2019s an invitation. It\u2019s not about, you know, you can\u2019t say, I\u2019m the boss. You will innovate. That is useless. You can only invite them. This is why the willing is an important piece of the puzzle. So how do we write invitations or send invitations to people? We think about that a lot when we\u2019re doing a party or whatever we\u2019re going to do. So when you\u2019re trying to invite someone to do something that\u2019s really going to be very hard, you have to understand why."]},{"begin":"536.640","end":"557.640","lines":["And the only way you\u2019re going to get what you need out of them is if they share with them what we refer to as their slice of genius. Everybody has a slice of genius. Everyone has talents. Everyone has passions. And what you\u2019re trying to do in your communication is help tap into what their talents and passions are, connect them to some collective good, and help them understand the connection between the two."]},{"begin":"557.640","end":"558.160","lines":["[00:09:17]"]},{"begin":"558.160","end":"594.600","lines":["So purpose, the why, is where the alignment comes. It\u2019s not about where we\u2019re going, because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going. So how you help people understand that and tell a story where they see, yeah, I care about that and I see why you need me to give my all, my slice of genius to help do this collective thing we want to do, since the book is called Collective Genius. The concept of Slice of Genius came from the work I did at Pixar. And they talk about everybody having a slice of genius, and when we were thinking about what should we call our book, we felt that Collective Genius was the only thing we could do."]},{"begin":"594.600","end":"633.320","lines":["[00:09:53]: I love that storytelling is a critical component in innovation and declaring purpose. And purpose is really about the why and the sense of urgency. And we talk often on this podcast about knowing your audience when you communicate, when you tell stories. And I love your language around slice of genius. What that really is to my mind, to my ear is that you\u2019re looking to understand the value that people bring, the unique value. And that\u2019s really understanding who you\u2019re speaking to. So innovation boils down to, in many ways, the ability to align and motivate people behind the why. And storytelling helps you do that."]},{"begin":"633.320","end":"643.280","lines":["Yes, indeed, you\u2019re right. And I would say that there are capabilities that need to be in place once you have inspired people, the willing part of it. But you also have to help them be able."]},{"begin":"643.280","end":"667.160","lines":["[00:10:43]: Since we\u2019re sitting in HBR\u2019s studio, I wanted to highlight an article that you wrote. And in it, you talk about the importance of collaboration, but you also talk about the importance of conflict. And I\u2019d love for you to talk about the value of conflict in these processes, because I think so many people listening, and myself included are conflict averse, we feel conflict is bad and I think you have a very different perspective on it that I\u2019d love for you to share."]},{"begin":"667.160","end":"704.600","lines":["This idea of innovation being the result of a collaboration is not the result of my work. There\u2019s a whole history of that. What we did in our work is look at the connection between leadership and innovation because as it turns out, most people who study innovation are either economists or macro sociologists so they don\u2019t really care as much about what the individual leader needs to do and this is how we discovered we needed to talk a lot more about conflict. And what we saw in our work when we looked at organizations that were very innovative is, yeah, we know we need to collaborate, as I told you, but what\u2019s the real test of collaboration? And that is whether or not you can take advantage of all the diversity of thought you need to get that innovative solution."]},{"begin":"704.600","end":"706.200","lines":["[00:11:45]"]},{"begin":"706.200","end":"727.520","lines":["So when you have diversity of thought, by definition, you have the potential for conflict. So if you cannot deal with conflict, then you\u2019re either going to compromise, a lowest common denominator, or you\u2019re going to let one group dominate. So the capabilities really are about how we actually use our diversity of thought in a constructive way and come up with innovative solutions."]},{"begin":"727.520","end":"728.160","lines":["[00:12:07]"]},{"begin":"728.160","end":"753.600","lines":["So the first one is creative abrasion. If you want to have an innovative solution, you as a leader actually want to amplify the differences that are happening, not minimize them. And once they\u2019re amplified, if people are talented and passionate, guess what? There\u2019s going to be a little bit of tussle. And if you are not comfortable as a leader allowing for that tussle, then you\u2019re not going to get the full advantage of that diversity of thought, you\u2019re going to cut somebody off."]},{"begin":"753.600","end":"754.280","lines":["[00:12:33]"]},{"begin":"754.280","end":"773.520","lines":["The second one is about creative agility and that is, can we experiment and learn together because you cannot really plan your way to an innovation, you have to act your way to an innovation. So I\u2019m not surprised. Agile methodologies, lean start-up, design thinking, all of that stuff, that is really about how you experiment and learn as efficiently as you can."]},{"begin":"773.520","end":"774.880","lines":["[00:12:54]"]},{"begin":"774.880","end":"790.840","lines":["The last capability, which goes to why communication becomes very important too, is creative resolution. And that is about how we make a decision. So we have our tussle and we have our conflict, we might start experimenting and all along the way we have to make various decisions, do we go this way or that way."]},{"begin":"790.840","end":"810.200","lines":["And that\u2019s what creative resolution is about. What you see in organizations that are very innovative is that people do not compromise, do not go along to get along. They also don\u2019t let one group dominate. They don\u2019t let the bosses dominate and they don\u2019t let the experts dominate. And the experts are a real challenge when you\u2019re trying to do something new."]},{"begin":"810.200","end":"821.680","lines":["And the final thing is, instead they have a more patient and inclusive way of allowing the voices to be heard. And that means working through things. So we all need to be communicating as effectively as we can."]},{"begin":"821.680","end":"857.160","lines":["[00:13:42]: So much in what you just said, the value of conflict is that it provides a diversity of opinions and it allows for more creative solutions and innovation to arise. But you have to set up an infrastructure, a way of being that allows for that to happen. And we have to be very clear on making sure that everybody can contribute to that conversation, be it collaborative and, or conflictual. And we have to be very clear on who makes those decisions. I want to move to something that personally is fascinating and something we visited a lot on this podcast."]},{"begin":"857.160","end":"870.880","lines":["You talk about six dilemmas for innovative change. One of them has to do with a tension that we\u2019ve often talked about, which is the struggle between structure and improvisation. Can you elaborate on this dialectic and how it helps in innovation?"]},{"begin":"870.880","end":"913.720","lines":["[00:14:30]: So there are these six dilemmas, or paradoxes, that must be managed as you\u2019re trying to innovate. And whether or not your team develops those capabilities relates to your capacity as a leader to deal with those six dilemmas. One of them is in fact, improvisation and structure. So it turns out that the six are laid out in a way that when you\u2019re behaving on one side, you\u2019re actually unleashing people\u2019s slices of genius, you\u2019re amplifying. When you\u2019re playing on the other side, you\u2019re harnessing or leveraging them for the collective good. So on the one side for unleashing, which is very consistent with the kinds of conditions that my colleague Amy Edmondson says you need for psychological safety, is you\u2019re going to have to improvise."]},{"begin":"913.720","end":"929.960","lines":["If you want that individual to be able to do his best work, or her best work, you may have to do things a little differently and create the circumstances that fit them and the way they do their best work. It may be different for them than me. On the other hand, when you\u2019re trying to leverage and get to the collective good, you got to put some structures in place."]},{"begin":"929.960","end":"966.360","lines":["So you do want to have structures in place. You want to have the least amount of structure you need, but structures that help us either collaborate, experiment, or learn. And if the structures aren\u2019t helping us with those three things, then that sort of bureaucracy has a purpose. But if it\u2019s not about that, then we don\u2019t need it. So hierarchy does matter. It is helpful for us to know what the hierarchy is and what the roles are because it just lets us be more agile, to be quick. I don\u2019t have to ask you every time, what\u2019s your job, et cetera. So the structures that you put in place are in support of our being able to collaborate, experiment, learn together, make decisions in the creative resolution kind of way."]},{"begin":"966.360","end":"990.280","lines":["[00:16:06]: You\u2019re echoing a conversation we\u2019ve had often about the value of structure. Having a minimal structure enables the creativity. If you don\u2019t have the structure, the hierarchy in place, you could have anarchy and you could have confusion. So structure enables, supports, and allows people to be creative and innovative."]},{"begin":"990.280","end":"1008.240","lines":["And we\u2019ve talked about it often in spontaneous communication moments when I have to answer a question, give feedback. And what you\u2019re sharing is this works at a collective level, and that\u2019s really important. Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you three questions. One I create just for you and the other two are similar to everyone I interview. Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"1008.240","end":"1009.400","lines":["Oh dear, yes."]},{"begin":"1009.400","end":"1020.720","lines":["[00:16:49]: You are incredibly collaborative as a researcher and as an author.

And I like strong willed people. I always pick people who have a point of view. And who I find are pretty talented, but they\u2019re younger than me. That they\u2019re old souls, it turns out all of them, I think. But fundamentally they will take me on. I pick people that I really am going to learn from and I enjoy, and are outspoken."]},{"begin":"1059.120","end":"1072.400","lines":["[00:17:38]: I like that you think about the quality of the communication you have.

Question number two, who\u2019s a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1072.400","end":"1109.960","lines":["One I have on my mind just at the moment is Vineet Nayar. I don\u2019t know that you would know his name or not. He was the CEO of HCL Technologies. And HCL Technologies was the company that started the computer business in India, but it lost its way. He\u2019s an unbelievable communicator. He wrote a book called Employees First, Customers Second. The reason why he\u2019s such a good communicator is his language is so visual and so colorful. It\u2019s about communicating in simple but vibrant ways. And I highly recommend you look up Employees First, Customer Second, or anything that Vineet has written or said."]},{"begin":"1109.960","end":"1123.880","lines":["[00:18:30]: So what I\u2019m hearing that makes him such a powerful communicator is that he\u2019s able to paint a picture with the words. Final question, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1123.880","end":"1147.080","lines":["The first, I would say is there\u2019s something about it that is provocative, that gets your attention. It really raises a question and you\u2019re really eager to hear how that question is going to be answered. I think the other thing is that you do in fact know your audience. You\u2019re empathic enough to know this is the way I need to come at this with this particular group of people, because this is the kind of thing they care about."]},{"begin":"1147.080","end":"1163.600","lines":["So I think you do take the time to know your audience. I think the other thing about communication, when you\u2019re communicating, you are trying to engage someone\u2019s head and someone\u2019s heart. And to the extent that you can think about both when you\u2019re communicating with them, the communication is going to be more powerful."]},{"begin":"1163.600","end":"1184.400","lines":["And I think we all meet people that can do the head piece of it very well, and we\u2019re impressed and we get it, but then afterwards we don\u2019t remember much of it. And then we meet people who do the heart and sometimes you think about a little bit more was, what was the there there, but you kind of remember it more. And so when you can get that combination of both, I think that\u2019s when the communication has been quite powerful, which is why storytelling is important."]},{"begin":"1184.400","end":"1203.240","lines":["[00:19:45]: Creating curiosity by being provocative, really knowing your audience and being able to balance and give importance to the heart and the feeling, not just the information.
