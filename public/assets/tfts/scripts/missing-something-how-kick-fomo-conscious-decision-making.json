How to Kick FOMO with Conscious Decision-Making","url":"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/missing-something-how-kick-fomo-conscious-decision-making","intro":["What if you had that job? What if you were with that person? What if there's a better option out there? If you find yourself asking these questions, Patrick McGinnis invented the term for what you're experiencing: FOMO.","First coined by McGinnis in a piece published by the Harvard Business School newspaper, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) describes the anxiety we feel when thinking that other people are having more fun and living more fulfilling lives than we are. As McGinnis says, \u201cWe are constantly comparing ourselves to other people. We are seeing the options that are out there. And then we're saying, what I'm doing right now isn't good enough. I am missing out on something.\u201d","Both in his book, Fear of Missing Out: Practical Decision-Making in a World of Overwhelming Choice, and in this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, McGinnis explains how conscious decision-making can help us feel more sure of our choices and experience less anxiety about the options we pass up."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One of the biggest fears that I struggle with is the fear of missing out. Is there a better opportunity? Are there other people I should be talking to? Is this the right place to eat or visit? The fear of missing out looms large in my life. Today we\u2019ll explore FOMO and how to deal with it. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams. I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast. Today I am really excited to speak with Patrick McGinnis. Patrick is the bestselling author of Fear of Missing Out Practical Decision-Making in a World of Overwhelming Choice and the 10% Entrepreneur. He\u2019s also the creator and host of the FOMO Sapiens podcast. Patrick, thanks so much for being here."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Thanks so much for having me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I certainly don\u2019t want to miss out of any of our conversations, so let\u2019s go ahead and get started. It\u2019s hard for me to believe, but I\u2019m actually talking to the originator of the term FOMO, fear of missing Out. In preparing for this chat, you told me that FOMO, in your words, hijacks us and takes us away from our intentions and gets us to do and say things we don\u2019t want and probably shouldn\u2019t want. I\u2019d love for you to share more about what FOMO is and how does it work against us."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Yeah, FOMO is, it\u2019s a word that we use in jest a lot. It\u2019s sort of like a meme, and it is a word that I created when I wrote about it in a humor article in the newspaper of Harvard Business School about 20 years ago when I was a student there, so sorry, Stanford people. FOMO was invented at Harvard, and it would\u2019ve probably stayed there except that all my classmates, I\u2019ll go to McKinsey all over the world and started using it. And then there was a guy who was my neighbor, his name\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who happened to start this company called Facebook that gave us all FOMO. When I invented it, I saw it very much as a high-class problem of MBA students who had so many options that they could go anywhere they wanted on the weekend, they could fly off to Europe, they could go on vacation, they could apply to a million jobs, all this sort of stuff."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Now, what that has materialized into today is a phenomenon in which many of us, because of the pernicious effects of social media, because of the accelerant that is being able to figure out what other people are doing all the time we are living lives in which we are constantly comparing ourselves to other people, we are seeing the options that are out there, and then we\u2019re saying, what I\u2019m doing right now isn\u2019t good enough. I am missing out on something. And so it\u2019s not just about the party or the vacation. It goes much, much deeper. When I go on LinkedIn, I start to question every decision I\u2019ve ever made professionally when I see my classmates or the CEO of this or the partner at that. And the reality is, of course, that all of this is an internal struggle. It is something we are putting on ourselves. We are creating a narrative inside of our head about something that we don\u2019t even really know that much about. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019d like to be a partner at a law firm or a partner at Goldman Sachs. We don\u2019t know if we would like to go to this place or do that thing, but we create a best case scenario just like we put filters on social media and then we compare our present condition to those things and we feel inadequate. So that\u2019s the hijacking that happens."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I certainly personally myself, have suffered from a lot of FOMO. It\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve struggled with for a long time, and when I learned of the term, it actually gave me some solace because it helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t the only one. I mean, if there\u2019s a term out there and people are talking about it, then it actually helped to put into perspective for me. However, I still struggle with it. So I\u2019m wondering if you can suggest ways to reduce or stop FOMO, and I\u2019m especially curious if you can give ideas or suggest ways in which communication plays a role in how we can reduce our FOMO."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"I love this problem, and part of the reason I love this problem is because the communication that we\u2019re focusing on is internal. It is the internal talk track of your life. And as somebody who has always been highly competitive and loved to win, my talk track has constantly been, I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m not doing the best thing. And that is so many of us in the world of MBAs and business people and all the things that we all do, and it\u2019s a motivator. So FOMO is not all bad. FOMO is a beautiful motivator, and if we can tap into it and control it and not let it get out of hand, it can be wonderful. But the problem is if it gets out of hand, it causes us to do bad things. It causes us to feel bad. It has a lot of emotional tolls."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"There\u2019s a real psychological sort of implication here. Now, how then do we manage that internal conversation? Well, FOMO is created by two powerful forces. The first is what I call the aspirational FOMO. It\u2019s the idea that something\u2019s bigger and better shinier and that we want to have that thing right. It\u2019s great in a sense because it means that we want more and we have aspirations. But of course what happens is that it gets out of hand. So the aspirational FOMO is part one. The second is herd FOMO. Everybody\u2019s doing that thing. I\u2019m not. Should I be doing that thing? And that comes from our earliest humans, I mean our ancestors, they stuck together in packs because if they got separated, they didn\u2019t have the information, they didn\u2019t have the physical safety they needed. Of course, today it\u2019s not physical safety, it\u2019s psychological safety that we\u2019re seeking when we have FOMO."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"So, to deal with those, we must attack each one for the aspirational FOMO. We must ask ourselves. It\u2019s a pretty basic set of questions. Things like, is that thing as good as it looks? Can I afford to do that? Do I have time to do that? What are the trade-offs I must make to do that? And then we must dig into that thing and replace the fear with facts so that we can make a decision based on data, not emotion. So that\u2019s how you attack the aspirational FOMO on the herd. FOMO, that\u2019s a question of motivation. And so the question you must ask yourself is, why do I want this thing? Is this something I truly want? Do I have agency or am I simply following the crowd? And we all know from we were little kids that you don\u2019t just follow the crowd. Nobody. If so-and-so jumps off a bridge, will you jump off? Of course not yet. Emotionally and psychologically when we have FOMO, we\u2019re jumping off many bridges. So you got to attack those two roots and then you are good to go."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you for delineating the inner workings of FOMO. The aspirational versus the herd makes a lot of sense to me. I had never thought of that, but in reflecting on the FOMO I have, I certainly have both, but it helps to have names to those and the ability to introspect, to reflect as a way to help ourselves out of it and to change that talk track makes a lot of sense to me. I love your fear to fact combat the fear by looking at the facts and then really questioning our motivations makes a lot of sense. So thank you for that. You\u2019ve also coined another term, FOBO, fear of a better option. Can you help us understand what is FOBO and how is it different from FOMO?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"It is a very, very high class problem. FOBO stands for fear of a better option. It\u2019s the idea that we are waiting for something slightly better to come along. You\u2019re trying to pick the hotel for the vacation. You\u2019ve got three job offers. You\u2019re on the dating app and you keep swiping and swiping and swiping, and you never actually choose. And unlike FOMO, I like to think of sort of this as drinking wine and smoking. FOMO is like drinking wine. You can drink some wine and if you have a lot of wine, of course it\u2019s bad, but you have a little wine, it\u2019s okay, you have a little more fun, you loosen up, you dance, all that sort of stuff. FOBO is like smoking. Nothing good about it. And also terrible secondhand effects. So it is the kind of thing that I see amongst my friends and classmates from Harvard Business School. The more options you have, the more money, the more power you become trapped within this world of Fogo because you can, because it\u2019s really an affliction of affluence."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love how you used a really powerful analogy of helping clarify through the analogy of drinking versus smoking. I always look for how people explicate concepts, and you did a great job there. I too, I guess am fortunate enough to have Fogo. I guess it\u2019s a gift, right? That you can actually experience it. So let me ask you the same question I asked regarding FOMO. What can we do to help reduce or stop FOBO from in some ways paralyzing us and making us miserable when we should actually be doing quite well?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Yeah, and it\u2019s close to FOMO. There are very similar characteristics here, but again, it\u2019s that internal talk track and saying to yourself, oh, if I just keep looking, if I keep searching, I will find something better. And that is fallacious. Because what happens is that we fool ourselves into thinking that the more we look, the better we will come out. But the reality is the longer you wait, the more likely it is that in fact some of those options slip away. And that is the danger over time offices, they don\u2019t last forever. They do go away. And so number one is to remember that. And number two is to have a conversation with yourself about what really matters. What am I actually looking for? What are my criteria? A lot of times people get stuck because they\u2019ve never set the criteria that they\u2019re trying to measure towards."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"And so if you do create that criteria, you\u2019re positioned to be able to then make better decisions. Now what I do, and this is where things get extra fun, and I did a fun video for Ted around this that was called How to Make Faster Decisions, is that a lot of the things that give me Fogo actually are things that don\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s like which restaurant to go to or which hotel or which TV to buy, stuff like that. Because why? Because when you go on Amazon and you want to buy a pair of white socks, there are a thousand different choices. It\u2019s overwhelming. We live in a world where there\u2019s just too much. I outsource everything. I never pick the restaurant, you pick the restaurant, I don\u2019t decide the tv. I get the wire cutter on New York Times to do it for me. I just go with what they say. And so the more that you do that, you outsource simple decision making in your life, you actually build up a muscle around decision-making that is very powerful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So two things I heard there. First, you need to think about what does success look like? What is it that I\u2019m really trying to achieve here? Have some goals around that to then help become criteria for decision-making. And then when possible, don\u2019t put yourself in a position where you have to be concerned about what a potential outcome could be. Outsource it if you can. I love that idea. I can\u2019t tell you in my immediate family, there\u2019s a lot of rumination over decisions that I think could be easily outsourced to people who are better served to make those decisions like Wirecutter, like consumer reports, things of that nature. In a conversation you and I had in advance of this, Patrick, you shared with me that you love language and love words, and I just want to comment on that. It comes through in your communication. I love that you use words like fallacious and pernicious and use analogies to help explain things that you\u2019re an author, a podcast host, you\u2019re using language all the time. Talk to me about your thoughts on language and the importance of it and why is it important? What do you think about when you think about using language effectively?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"That\u2019s the best question anybody\u2019s ever asked me in all of my interviews ever. And I mean that I love that and just put a smile on my face because I do love language and I also speak for languages. So I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and I love foreign language as well, and I love the English language. To me, when you\u2019re using words, it\u2019s just like a puzzle that you\u2019re spontaneously, and why not try to make it as interesting as possible? And so to me, it\u2019s just like a constant opportunity to amuse myself and to challenge myself to be clever. And that\u2019s why I so enjoy meeting people who love words as well and who are clever conversationalists because it\u2019s sort of like a game. You\u2019re playing a game that is very fast-paced and fun. And the reality is if you use language creatively, you\u2019ll never be bored, and I\u2019m easily bored. So that\u2019s really what it\u2019s for me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I appreciate that. I too see communication as a puzzle, and I love trying to play with communication. I\u2019m a huge fan of alliteration, and I always try to throw alliteration in wherever I can. What I find that you do really interesting, and I\u2019d love for people to listen to how you speak, you\u2019ll use engaging words and vocabulary that might not be as common, but you then very quickly in either the example you give or the very next phrase, you in essence define the word for us. So you help bring along those who might not know the word. And that\u2019s a skill that I think any of us who serve as teachers or educators could bring to help people understand what we\u2019re saying."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to ask you, what are you thinking about next? What\u2019s the next think that you\u2019re thinking of? I put some thought into this myself, and maybe this is just where I am in my age and in my stage of life, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot of FOGO, fear of growing old and also relatedly, FOPO, fear of peeing often. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s going on for you in terms of your thoughts about what\u2019s next to look at?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"I love this question because I hadn\u2019t thought about this, but now you just got me. I\u2019m going to, can I break some news here? And it\u2019s such the right place to do this because of the Stanford connection. So I\u2019ve been thinking about the venture capital market. So I do venture capital investing in addition to the other things I do. And right now there\u2019s a big retrade happening down rounds and renegotiations of terms and things like that. And it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon that needs a name and people are starting to say, oh, it\u2019s pay to play and all this sort of stuff. And I don\u2019t like that term. I think it sounds very negative because if you\u2019re a venture capitalist and you\u2019re supporting a company and you\u2019re able to renegotiate all the crazy terms that you had last year and get something a bit more appropriate and support a company, that\u2019s a good thing. And we should call that out and we should appropriately value it. So I\u2019m calling that a support premium."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I like it."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Yes. And I want to do something with it Support premium. That\u2019s one of the words that I really like. And so I hope all you VCs listening, I want to be the person from Cowboy Ventures who coined Unicorn. I want support premium to be big."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Alright, well we\u2019ll try to help you with that. But I think support premium spans beyond just capital. I think like FOMO and FOBO. I think there are lots of areas of our life where that idea resonates. Well. Before I end, I like to ask some questions of my guests that are a little rapid fire. Give us a little personal insight. Are you up for answering some of these?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My first question is targeted based on who you are and what you look at and study. So I want to ask you, Patrick, what gives you FOMO? What gives you FOMO the most? For me, it\u2019s social. It\u2019s all socially related. I always wonder, am I missing out on some great conversation or great connection? What gives you FOMO?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"What doesn\u2019t? Everything. I left the corporate world to do something very unconventional and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it, but I constantly ask myself, is this the right path for me? And I think that that\u2019s very natural in the human experience, and I try to shut it down and I know how to manage it, but I always wonder, should I have done this other thing? Would I be better at this other thing?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I can relate to that too. I\u2019ve made several career choices and I often wonder, did I make the right choice? I\u2019m very, very thrilled with what I do, but it\u2019s always, it\u2019s a curiosity of what could the other be. Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"So I just met this woman at a conference in Sweden called Brilliant Minds. Her name is Rupi Kuar. Rupi is a poet. She got up and read a poem about the female experience. It was amazing, and you all should check her out. She\u2019s got a huge Instagram following. And just the fact that she, in this day and age that a poet has, the kind of audiences she has and the things she talks about aren\u2019t easy. And when she performs her poetry, it is spell binding and then you hang out with her and she\u2019s just like the nicest person. And when I met her, I felt like I\u2019d known her for years. She is able to connect with people in a way that I find amazing, whether she\u2019s on a stage or in a small conversation. And I just came away being like, I really, really admire her and I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s my friend."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m not surprised that you pick somebody who uses language, in this case, poetry to be effective and that it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s passionate and really connecting, and that seems to be who you are too. Question number three, our final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"All right, I love this question. The first is truth. We got to be truthful, like misinformation, disinformation, it\u2019s the worst. Truth is number one. Number two, humility. When you\u2019re communicating who\u2019s the star of the show, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s the person who receives the communication, whether you\u2019re a writer or a podcaster or just a person having a chat. And number three, panache got to have a little personal style, a little charisma, and so we have this rich language. It\u2019s amazing. Use it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I absolutely agree. And I think based on what we\u2019ve talked about today, Patrick, I think it\u2019s not just objective truth outside of us, but also part of what you talked about in terms of managing FOMO and FOMO as we have to think about our inner truth and what\u2019s important to us, making the other person the star. It\u2019s all about them. Absolutely. 100%. We hear that a lot on this podcast and wholeheartedly believe it. I want to hear just a little bit more about Panache. I love this idea. Besides the language we use, what else can convey this notion of panache?"},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"It\u2019s a good question, and by the way, everybody should have the experience of having Matt summarize what you just said because it\u2019s great. You summarize it. I\u2019m like, did I? It\u2019s better than what I said. I\u2019m very impressed. You\u2019re a good listener."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you. My wife would disagree, by the way, but yes, thank you."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"For me, panache, it\u2019s sort of like we spend so much time trying to look good, buying nice clothes, getting dressed up and all that sort of stuff. And then we open our mouths and we should do the same. We should try to have a little bit of style, a little bit of charisma, a little bit of elegance, language. It\u2019s an incredible way to connect with people. And if you invest in language, your ability to meet people and make an impression on them, it\u2019s incredible. And I\u2019ve found as I\u2019ve become a stronger communicator, I look at every time I talk as an opportunity to just experiment, freestyle, improvise, and just engage with people. And the more that you add a little flavor, the better you\u2019ll do."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s like cooking a good recipe, a little extra flavor makes a big difference."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"Just put turmeric in everything. It\u2019s going to be delicious."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. I like it. The point you made there that I really took to heart is we dress up ourselves for important communication. Let\u2019s dress up our language as well. Patrick, this has been fantastic. Thank you for being here. We have all learned a lot about the way we can approach our lives and perhaps reduce some of the stress and pressure we put on ourselves. I certainly have. I wish you well with your books, fear of Missing Out as well as the 10% Entrepreneur. And congratulations on the success of FOMO Sapiens, your podcast. Thank you."},{"author":"Patrick McGinnis","text":"I want to thank you for offering me a support premium, and I wish you the best of luck."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

of the biggest fears that I struggle with is the fear of missing out. Is there a better opportunity? Are there other people I should be talking to? Is this the right place to eat or visit? The fear of missing out looms large in my life. Today we\u2019ll explore FOMO and how to deal with it. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams. I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast. Today I am really excited to speak with Patrick McGinnis. Patrick is the bestselling author of Fear of Missing Out Practical Decision-Making in a World of Overwhelming Choice and the 10% Entrepreneur.

It\u2019s hard for me to believe, but I\u2019m actually talking to the originator of the term FOMO, fear of missing Out. In preparing for this chat, you told me that FOMO, in your words, hijacks us and takes us away from our intentions and gets us to do and say things we don\u2019t want and probably shouldn\u2019t want. I\u2019d love for you to share more about what FOMO is and how does it work against us."]},{"begin":"86.000","end":"129.960","lines":["Yeah, FOMO is, it\u2019s a word that we use in jest a lot. It\u2019s sort of like a meme, and it is a word that I created when I wrote about it in a humor article in the newspaper of Harvard Business School about 20 years ago when I was a student there, so sorry, Stanford people. FOMO was invented at Harvard, and it would\u2019ve probably stayed there except that all my classmates, I\u2019ll go to McKinsey all over the world and started using it. And then there was a guy who was my neighbor, his name\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who happened to start this company called Facebook that gave us all FOMO. When I invented it, I saw it very much as a high-class problem of MBA students who had so many options that they could go anywhere they wanted on the weekend, they could fly off to Europe, they could go on vacation, they could apply to a million jobs, all this sort of stuff."]},{"begin":"129.960","end":"202.600","lines":["Now, what that has materialized into today is a phenomenon in which many of us, because of the pernicious effects of social media, because of the accelerant that is being able to figure out what other people are doing all the time we are living lives in which we are constantly comparing ourselves to other people, we are seeing the options that are out there, and then we\u2019re saying, what I\u2019m doing right now isn\u2019t good enough. I am missing out on something. And so it\u2019s not just about the party or the vacation. It goes much, much deeper. When I go on LinkedIn, I start to question every decision I\u2019ve ever made professionally when I see my classmates or the CEO of this or the partner at that. And the reality is, of course, that all of this is an internal struggle. It is something we are putting on ourselves. We are creating a narrative inside of our head about something that we don\u2019t even really know that much about. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019d like to be a partner at a law firm or a partner at Goldman Sachs. We don\u2019t know if we would like to go to this place or do that thing, but we create a best case scenario just like we put filters on social media and then we compare our present condition to those things and we feel inadequate. So that\u2019s the hijacking that happens."]},{"begin":"202.600","end":"240.240","lines":["I certainly personally myself, have suffered from a lot of FOMO. It\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve struggled with for a long time, and when I learned of the term, it actually gave me some solace because it helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t the only one. I mean, if there\u2019s a term out there and people are talking about it, then it actually helped to put into perspective for me. However, I still struggle with it. So I\u2019m wondering if you can suggest ways to reduce or stop FOMO, and I\u2019m especially curious if you can give ideas or suggest ways in which communication plays a role in how we can reduce our FOMO."]},{"begin":"240.240","end":"283.640","lines":["I love this problem, and part of the reason I love this problem is because the communication that we\u2019re focusing on is internal. It is the internal talk track of your life. And as somebody who has always been highly competitive and loved to win, my talk track has constantly been, I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m not doing the best thing. And that is so many of us in the world of MBAs and business people and all the things that we all do, and it\u2019s a motivator. So FOMO is not all bad. FOMO is a beautiful motivator, and if we can tap into it and control it and not let it get out of hand, it can be wonderful. But the problem is if it gets out of hand, it causes us to do bad things. It causes us to feel bad. It has a lot of emotional tolls."]},{"begin":"283.640","end":"332.520","lines":["There\u2019s a real psychological sort of implication here. Now, how then do we manage that internal conversation? Well, FOMO is created by two powerful forces. The first is what I call the aspirational FOMO. It\u2019s the idea that something\u2019s bigger and better shinier and that we want to have that thing right. It\u2019s great in a sense because it means that we want more and we have aspirations. But of course what happens is that it gets out of hand. So the aspirational FOMO is part one. The second is herd FOMO. Everybody\u2019s doing that thing. I\u2019m not. Should I be doing that thing? And that comes from our earliest humans, I mean our ancestors, they stuck together in packs because if they got separated, they didn\u2019t have the information, they didn\u2019t have the physical safety they needed. Of course, today it\u2019s not physical safety, it\u2019s psychological safety that we\u2019re seeking when we have FOMO."]},{"begin":"332.520","end":"385.800","lines":["So, to deal with those, we must attack each one for the aspirational FOMO. We must ask ourselves. It\u2019s a pretty basic set of questions. Things like, is that thing as good as it looks? Can I afford to do that? Do I have time to do that? What are the trade-offs I must make to do that? And then we must dig into that thing and replace the fear with facts so that we can make a decision based on data, not emotion. So that\u2019s how you attack the aspirational FOMO on the herd. FOMO, that\u2019s a question of motivation. And so the question you must ask yourself is, why do I want this thing? Is this something I truly want? Do I have agency or am I simply following the crowd? And we all know from we were little kids that you don\u2019t just follow the crowd. Nobody. If so-and-so jumps off a bridge, will you jump off? Of course not yet. Emotionally and psychologically when we have FOMO, we\u2019re jumping off many bridges. So you got to attack those two roots and then you are good to go."]},{"begin":"385.800","end":"429.160","lines":["Thank you for delineating the inner workings of FOMO. The aspirational versus the herd makes a lot of sense to me. I had never thought of that, but in reflecting on the FOMO I have, I certainly have both, but it helps to have names to those and the ability to introspect, to reflect as a way to help ourselves out of it and to change that talk track makes a lot of sense to me. I love your fear to fact combat the fear by looking at the facts and then really questioning our motivations makes a lot of sense. So thank you for that. You\u2019ve also coined another term, FOBO, fear of a better option. Can you help us understand what is FOBO and how is it different from FOMO?"]},{"begin":"429.160","end":"490.000","lines":["It is a very, very high class problem. FOBO stands for fear of a better option. It\u2019s the idea that we are waiting for something slightly better to come along. You\u2019re trying to pick the hotel for the vacation. You\u2019ve got three job offers. You\u2019re on the dating app and you keep swiping and swiping and swiping, and you never actually choose. And unlike FOMO, I like to think of sort of this as drinking wine and smoking. FOMO is like drinking wine. You can drink some wine and if you have a lot of wine, of course it\u2019s bad, but you have a little wine, it\u2019s okay, you have a little more fun, you loosen up, you dance, all that sort of stuff. FOBO is like smoking. Nothing good about it. And also terrible secondhand effects. So it is the kind of thing that I see amongst my friends and classmates from Harvard Business School. The more options you have, the more money, the more power you become trapped within this world of Fogo because you can, because it\u2019s really an affliction of affluence."]},{"begin":"490.000","end":"523.880","lines":["I love how you used a really powerful analogy of helping clarify through the analogy of drinking versus smoking. I always look for how people explicate concepts, and you did a great job there. I too, I guess am fortunate enough to have Fogo. I guess it\u2019s a gift, right? That you can actually experience it. So let me ask you the same question I asked regarding FOMO. What can we do to help reduce or stop FOBO from in some ways paralyzing us and making us miserable when we should actually be doing quite well?"]},{"begin":"523.880","end":"573.400","lines":["Yeah, and it\u2019s close to FOMO. There are very similar characteristics here, but again, it\u2019s that internal talk track and saying to yourself, oh, if I just keep looking, if I keep searching, I will find something better. And that is fallacious. Because what happens is that we fool ourselves into thinking that the more we look, the better we will come out. But the reality is the longer you wait, the more likely it is that in fact some of those options slip away. And that is the danger over time offices, they don\u2019t last forever. They do go away. And so number one is to remember that. And number two is to have a conversation with yourself about what really matters. What am I actually looking for? What are my criteria? A lot of times people get stuck because they\u2019ve never set the criteria that they\u2019re trying to measure towards."]},{"begin":"573.400","end":"624.480","lines":["And so if you do create that criteria, you\u2019re positioned to be able to then make better decisions. Now what I do, and this is where things get extra fun, and I did a fun video for Ted around this that was called How to Make Faster Decisions, is that a lot of the things that give me Fogo actually are things that don\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s like which restaurant to go to or which hotel or which TV to buy, stuff like that. Because why? Because when you go on Amazon and you want to buy a pair of white socks, there are a thousand different choices. It\u2019s overwhelming. We live in a world where there\u2019s just too much. I outsource everything. I never pick the restaurant, you pick the restaurant, I don\u2019t decide the tv. I get the wire cutter on New York Times to do it for me. I just go with what they say. And so the more that you do that, you outsource simple decision making in your life, you actually build up a muscle around decision-making that is very powerful."]},{"begin":"624.480","end":"690.960","lines":["So two things I heard there. First, you need to think about what does success look like? What is it that I\u2019m really trying to achieve here? Have some goals around that to then help become criteria for decision-making. And then when possible, don\u2019t put yourself in a position where you have to be concerned about what a potential outcome could be. Outsource it if you can. I love that idea. I can\u2019t tell you in my immediate family, there\u2019s a lot of rumination over decisions that I think could be easily outsourced to people who are better served to make those decisions like Wirecutter, like consumer reports, things of that nature. In a conversation you and I had in advance of this, Patrick, you shared with me that you love language and love words, and I just want to comment on that. It comes through in your communication. I love that you use words like fallacious and pernicious and use analogies to help explain things that you\u2019re an author, a podcast host, you\u2019re using language all the time. Talk to me about your thoughts on language and the importance of it and why is it important? What do you think about when you think about using language effectively?"]},{"begin":"690.960","end":"753.400","lines":["That\u2019s the best question anybody\u2019s ever asked me in all of my interviews ever. And I mean that I love that and just put a smile on my face because I do love language and I also speak for languages. So I speak Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and I love foreign language as well, and I love the English language. To me, when you\u2019re using words, it\u2019s just like a puzzle that you\u2019re spontaneously, and why not try to make it as interesting as possible? And so to me, it\u2019s just like a constant opportunity to amuse myself and to challenge myself to be clever. And that\u2019s why I so enjoy meeting people who love words as well and who are clever conversationalists because it\u2019s sort of like a game. You\u2019re playing a game that is very fast-paced and fun. And the reality is if you use language creatively, you\u2019ll never be bored, and I\u2019m easily bored. So that\u2019s really what it\u2019s for me."]},{"begin":"753.400","end":"794.680","lines":["I appreciate that. I too see communication as a puzzle, and I love trying to play with communication. I\u2019m a huge fan of alliteration, and I always try to throw alliteration in wherever I can. What I find that you do really interesting, and I\u2019d love for people to listen to how you speak, you\u2019ll use engaging words and vocabulary that might not be as common, but you then very quickly in either the example you give or the very next phrase, you in essence define the word for us. So you help bring along those who might not know the word. And that\u2019s a skill that I think any of us who serve as teachers or educators could bring to help people understand what we\u2019re saying."]},{"begin":"794.680","end":"817.920","lines":["I want to ask you, what are you thinking about next? What\u2019s the next think that you\u2019re thinking of? I put some thought into this myself, and maybe this is just where I am in my age and in my stage of life, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot of FOGO, fear of growing old and also relatedly, FOPO, fear of peeing often. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s going on for you in terms of your thoughts about what\u2019s next to look at?"]},{"begin":"817.920","end":"872.400","lines":["I love this question because I hadn\u2019t thought about this, but now you just got me. I\u2019m going to, can I break some news here? And it\u2019s such the right place to do this because of the Stanford connection. So I\u2019ve been thinking about the venture capital market. So I do venture capital investing in addition to the other things I do. And right now there\u2019s a big retrade happening down rounds and renegotiations of terms and things like that. And it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon that needs a name and people are starting to say, oh, it\u2019s pay to play and all this sort of stuff. And I don\u2019t like that term. I think it sounds very negative because if you\u2019re a venture capitalist and you\u2019re supporting a company and you\u2019re able to renegotiate all the crazy terms that you had last year and get something a bit more appropriate and support a company, that\u2019s a good thing. And we should call that out and we should appropriately value it. So I\u2019m calling that a support premium."]},{"begin":"872.400","end":"873.720","lines":["I like it."]},{"begin":"873.720","end":"886.360","lines":["Yes. And I want to do something with it Support premium. That\u2019s one of the words that I really like. And so I hope all you VCs listening, I want to be the person from Cowboy Ventures who coined Unicorn. I want support premium to be big."]},{"begin":"886.360","end":"907.480","lines":["Alright, well we\u2019ll try to help you with that. But I think support premium spans beyond just capital. I think like FOMO and FOBO. I think there are lots of areas of our life where that idea resonates. Well. Before I end, I like to ask some questions of my guests that are a little rapid fire. Give us a little personal insight. Are you up for answering some of these?"]},{"begin":"907.480","end":"908.360","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"908.360","end":"927.560","lines":["My first question is targeted based on who you are and what you look at and study. So I want to ask you, Patrick, what gives you FOMO? What gives you FOMO the most? For me, it\u2019s social. It\u2019s all socially related. I always wonder, am I missing out on some great conversation or great connection? What gives you FOMO?"]},{"begin":"927.560","end":"951.920","lines":["What doesn\u2019t? Everything. I left the corporate world to do something very unconventional and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it, but I constantly ask myself, is this the right path for me? And I think that that\u2019s very natural in the human experience, and I try to shut it down and I know how to manage it, but I always wonder, should I have done this other thing? Would I be better at this other thing?"]},{"begin":"951.920","end":"970.880","lines":["I can relate to that too. I\u2019ve made several career choices and I often wonder, did I make the right choice? I\u2019m very, very thrilled with what I do, but it\u2019s always, it\u2019s a curiosity of what could the other be. Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"970.880","end":"1023.360","lines":["So I just met this woman at a conference in Sweden called Brilliant Minds. Her name is Rupi Kuar. Rupi is a poet. She got up and read a poem about the female experience. It was amazing, and you all should check her out. She\u2019s got a huge Instagram following. And just the fact that she, in this day and age that a poet has, the kind of audiences she has and the things she talks about aren\u2019t easy. And when she performs her poetry, it is spell binding and then you hang out with her and she\u2019s just like the nicest person. And when I met her, I felt like I\u2019d known her for years. She is able to connect with people in a way that I find amazing, whether she\u2019s on a stage or in a small conversation. And I just came away being like, I really, really admire her and I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s my friend."]},{"begin":"1023.360","end":"1043.440","lines":["I\u2019m not surprised that you pick somebody who uses language, in this case, poetry to be effective and that it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s passionate and really connecting, and that seems to be who you are too. Question number three, our final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1043.440","end":"1076.200","lines":["All right, I love this question. The first is truth. We got to be truthful, like misinformation, disinformation, it\u2019s the worst. Truth is number one. Number two, humility. When you\u2019re communicating who\u2019s the star of the show, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s the person who receives the communication, whether you\u2019re a writer or a podcaster or just a person having a chat. And number three, panache got to have a little personal style, a little charisma, and so we have this rich language. It\u2019s amazing. Use it."]},{"begin":"1076.200","end":"1109.040","lines":["I absolutely agree. And I think based on what we\u2019ve talked about today, Patrick, I think it\u2019s not just objective truth outside of us, but also part of what you talked about in terms of managing FOMO and FOMO as we have to think about our inner truth and what\u2019s important to us, making the other person the star. It\u2019s all about them. Absolutely. 100%. We hear that a lot on this podcast and wholeheartedly believe it. I want to hear just a little bit more about Panache. I love this idea. Besides the language we use, what else can convey this notion of panache?"]},{"begin":"1109.040","end":"1120.840","lines":["It\u2019s a good question, and by the way, everybody should have the experience of having Matt summarize what you just said because it\u2019s great. You summarize it. I\u2019m like, did I? It\u2019s better than what I said. I\u2019m very impressed. You\u2019re a good listener."]},{"begin":"1120.840","end":"1124.120","lines":["Thank you. My wife would disagree, by the way, but yes, thank you."]},{"begin":"1124.120","end":"1168.280","lines":["For me, panache, it\u2019s sort of like we spend so much time trying to look good, buying nice clothes, getting dressed up and all that sort of stuff. And then we open our mouths and we should do the same. We should try to have a little bit of style, a little bit of charisma, a little bit of elegance, language. It\u2019s an incredible way to connect with people. And if you invest in language, your ability to meet people and make an impression on them, it\u2019s incredible. And I\u2019ve found as I\u2019ve become a stronger communicator, I look at every time I talk as an opportunity to just experiment, freestyle, improvise, and just engage with people. And the more that you add a little flavor, the better you\u2019ll do."]},{"begin":"1168.280","end":"1172.200","lines":["It\u2019s like cooking a good recipe, a little extra flavor makes a big difference."]},{"begin":"1172.200","end":"1175.040","lines":["Just put turmeric in everything.

The point you made there that I really took to heart is we dress up ourselves for important communication. Let\u2019s dress up our language as well. Patrick, this has been fantastic.
