As he and Matt Abrahams discuss on this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, we have to be skilled translators, adept at decoding our ideas and recording them in ways our audience will understand."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"A lot of our communication is really about translation. Translating our ideas so other people can understand them. Being a leader, a manager, a working professional, part of your job is to understand the context, the knowledge level, the information that you need to communicate and translate in a way that people can understand it and work on it. My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today I\u2019m excited to be joined by Greg LaBlanc, who is a lecturer at Stanford GSB and Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. His research lies at the intersection of law, innovation, and the use of data in rapidly-changing industries. Greg\u2019s teaching covers many topics, including data strategy, digital transformation, human resource strategy, and behavioral finance. Greg also hosts the the Unsiloed podcast, which recently was added to the GSB podcast family. Welcome, Greg."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Thanks, Matt. Great to be here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am super-excited to be chatting with you. And I know we\u2019re going to talk about lots of cool topics, including podcasting. Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. You are truly a renaissance man. Your areas of research and teaching cover such a wide range of topics. I\u2019d love to focus on a few of these today that directly relate to communication. Let\u2019s start by talking about data, their importance and organizational success, and your advice and guidance on who best to communicate data inside and outside of an organization."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"That\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ve been teaching courses on data for a long time. And a lot of people think of this as a quantitative topic, where you have to understand the math and so forth. But I find that it\u2019s equally a qualitative topic. And you have to have an intuitive understanding of what\u2019s happening and how to ask questions, how to answer questions, and so forth."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And in my experience, if you think you understand something, but you\u2019re incapable of communicating it, it probably means that you don\u2019t really understand it. I think it was Einstein \u2014 I\u2019m not sure \u2014 who said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it to your grandmother or to a five-year-old, then you probably need to go back and reexamine what it is that you think you understand.\u201d"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And I think that\u2019s true not just for communicating with others, but also can you communicate it with yourself? Can you put things in you own words? So I always encourage students to put what they\u2019re learning into their own words, so that they can explain it back to themselves."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think all of us who teach have learned that having to teach something really forces you to learn it in a way that just thinking you know it doesn\u2019t bring you to that same level of knowledge. When it comes to taking numbers and taking data and communicating them, are there certain best practices you encourage your students to think about using analogies, making sure people understand the baseline or base rates? Anything in particular you focus on?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"We have three different ways of understanding the world. We have the formulaic way that involves complicated explanations. But we also understand things through stories, the narratives. And we also understand things through pictures and images. And those are a little bit deeper. They go back a little further in our evolutionary history. And so I try to encourage everyone to explain every concept in each of those three ways. So you should be well-practiced in switching gears and switching modes of explanation in all three ways."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it\u2019s like casting a wide net to bring in as many people as you can."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Yeah. And I think that even with the same audience member, if they see all three types of explanation they\u2019re going to learn more, than if they\u2019re only exposed to one."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. So getting people to think through different modalities I think absolutely helps them connect better and remember more. And it also forces all of us as communicators to stretch what we\u2019re comfortable with. Because I think many of us gravitate towards one of those three, and that\u2019s just the way we communicate. And by reminding ourselves that we have to leverage more can help us more accurately communicate the information."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We had our colleague, Rob Siegel, on this podcast a while back and we discussed the challenges and benefits of corporate digital transformation. I\u2019m curious to get your take on how companies and their employees can avoid some of the common pitfalls involved in digital transformation. And I\u2019m going to give you extra credit if you talk about communication in your answer."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"I\u2019m trained as an historian. Historians are always very skeptical when they\u2019re told everything is new, we\u2019re experiencing unprecedented change, and so forth. So we always tend to look back and say, \u201cYou know what? I think we\u2019ve seen this thing before.\u201d So I think that we are undergoing this massive fundamental transformation, but we\u2019ve been through transformations before."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And I think to be a good manager you have to be a change manager. It doesn\u2019t take a Stanford MBA to sit on top of a steady state and to just administer some inputs and outputs. To be someone who can change that function and radically transform things, that\u2019s really the most difficult aspect of business. And so I think that management today is increasingly change management."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Now that said, of course, the specifics of digital transformation are really about understanding how to match organizational architecture with the technology. And if you bolt on new technologies to existing organizational architecture, existing incentive structures, existing cultures, then you\u2019re going to have a Frankenstein monster company. So it\u2019s really about the management and the technology and how they fit."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it sounds like we over-index on the technology and we don\u2019t think about the actual specific, interpersonal, managerial, day-to-day interaction piece. And, of course, when you talk about change management you\u2019re talking about communication. How do we align people? How do we articulate clear goals, or key performance indicators? How do we get people in lockstep?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Have you, in your classes or in your experience as a consultant, seen that there are certain traps that people fall into beyond not seeing the change management piece?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Yeah. One of the reasons why I chose the term unsiloed for my podcast is because I\u2019m a big believer in, I don\u2019t way to say multitasking, but being multilingual. Being able to understand the discourse of different disciplines within the academy, but also understanding the different discourses of the different functional areas within a business."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"So I think many poorly run organizations have people that are overly specialized and they lack the capacity to communicate with people in different functional areas. Oftentimes, the people who are on the tech side of the business can\u2019t talk to the folks on the business side of the business and vice versa. So I think that in today\u2019s world to be a successful business person, successful manager, successful executive you have to be bilingual, trilingual, quadrilingual."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And you have to be able to translate. So you have to be able to translate what\u2019s going on on the tech side of the business to the folks who are less tech savvy. And you also need to be able to translate the business objectives to the folks who are in the tech trenches. And if you can do that \u2014 and sometimes I wonkishly say that\u2019s like being a human API \u2014 if you can be the human API within the organization who is the connector, the translator, then you will, ultimately, be indispensable and, ultimately, super-successful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I like that notion of human API being that interface that connects and translates. I recently interviewed a senior leader at the company that includes cliff notes, because I was interested in how do you relay complex information in a concise way. And he convinced me that it\u2019s not just the transmission of information, it\u2019s really about translating that information appropriately for the audience that you\u2019re working with and talking to. And that\u2019s exactly what you just said. As managers, as leaders part of our job is to translate information, rather than just broadcast information. I think that\u2019s really important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You are clearly a master teacher. You have won numerous teaching awards. Can you share some of your insights and teaching tactics you use that could help all of us as we mentor colleagues and pass along information in our work?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Well, those are some nice, kind words. I always think that there\u2019s room for improvement in the world of teaching. But I think when it comes to teaching you have to start with respect. You have to respect your students. You have to respect where they\u2019re coming from. You have to respect what they bring to the table. And you have to understand that you\u2019re going to learn from them. And if you walk into the teaching experience with a view to learning, then I think that you\u2019ll be successful as a teacher."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"At Berkeley, where I also teach, one of the mottos is students always. So you\u2019re going to be a student for the rest of your life. And if I can go in and add to that, I would add a fifth defining principle, which is teachers always. And being a teacher is being a student. I started in a Montessori school. I did Montessori through the third grade. And I knew when I was about three-years-old when I started Montessori school that I wanted to be a teacher."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Because in Montessori school, as soon as you learn something you have to turn to the people next to you and you have to teach them. And maybe you start teaching them before you\u2019ve even fully-ingested what it is that you\u2019re learning. And then as you start teaching it, what you encounter on the other side of that teaching interface helps you, then, to go back and learn better."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And so I really believe in that Montessori approach. It sort of informed everything that I\u2019ve done. So to be a teacher you have to be a good student. I think that\u2019s the one overarching principle and rule that I would recommend to every teacher."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And while it makes sense intuitively, I think a lot of people who find themselves in positions where they are teaching people feel like they have to be the expert. Like I have to know this, and I know something you don\u2019t know. And that sets up a very different relationship than what you\u2019re talking about, which is I have some things that I\u2019ve learned that I can pass to you, and you have some experiences you\u2019ve learned that you can pass to me. It\u2019s much more collaborative."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So while it sounds intuitive and makes sense, I think a lot of us who find ourselves in teaching positions don\u2019t always adopt that point of view. And the first thing you said when I asked the question, you said you really have to understand where your students, your recipients, the people you\u2019re mentoring are coming from, so that you can adjust and adapt. And that\u2019s a theme that we\u2019ve heard lots on this podcast. You have to know who you\u2019re speaking to and how to adjust to that audience."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to turn now to your podcast. When you and I first met I was in awe of the number of episodes you do and how frequently you do them, and the amount of reading that you do to prepare yourself. You do several episodes a week and you read several books a week. I am a very slow, methodical reader. I always have been. It\u2019s been a challenge for me. What advice do you have to help people read more quickly, or take in information more quickly and make it actionable? Because you clearly do that well. How do you do it? I want to learn personally."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"The skill that I\u2019ve developed is one that I encourage students to develop. And I think part of what you\u2019re learning in graduate school is you\u2019re learning how to process information more quickly and effectively. And to somehow take this firehose of information that\u2019s coming in from all directions and make sense of it."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And so if you have frameworks and theories and models, these are preexisting structures, which allow you to, as the information comes in in real-time you can sort it into different buckets. I like to talk about like a compression algorithm. If you have an image, if you\u2019re storing a movie and you go from frame to frame, you don\u2019t store every single frame. You just store, okay, what changed when you go from frame two to frame one? And that\u2019s a tiny, tiny bit of incremental information."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"So when I\u2019m reading books I\u2019m looking for, okay, what\u2019s new here? What lines up with what I already know and that I\u2019ve already seen? And I just check that box and say, \u201cOkay. This person is using this, this, this and this. And this framework to structure, this theory,\u201d etcetera. And then, boom! When I see the new stuff that\u2019s when my eyes light up. So I\u2019m reading the entire book, I\u2019m reading every word, but if it\u2019s familiar it flows very, very smoothly. And then I slow down when I see the stuff that is new."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So part of what I\u2019m hearing you say is that when you\u2019re reading you\u2019re synthesizing and prioritizing and packaging the information according to framework structures and theories that you\u2019ve already had in place. And that\u2019s really insightful for me, because I do that retrospectively, not concurrently. If I\u2019m done reading something I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, that links here.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And what I\u2019m hearing you say is you\u2019re doing it in real-time. And I can see how that can help me, and I can imagine it would help many of our listeners, especially when you\u2019re taking on new content or if you\u2019re new to the language that you\u2019re learning it in. If you can think about those heuristics in frameworks and apply them in the moment that can really help. I think you\u2019ve just made my life easier. I can read more quickly now."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, you know we like to end this podcast by asking the same three questions of everybody. So now it\u2019s your turn. Are you up for answering the questions?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Yeah. I\u2019ll give it a try."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. You\u2019re going to do great. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"I think it would be meet them where they are. I think it was Ignatius Loyola that is famous for having said this first. And I had spent some time at a Jesuit high school, and maybe that\u2019s where I picked it up. But the idea is that people are where they are when you first encounter them. And they\u2019re not going to be where you wish they were. That\u2019s why I would say that I don\u2019t think of myself as a great communicator because I have a long way to go with respect to this principle."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"I communicate best when I encounter people who enter the interaction with a lot of curiosity. And when I meet people that maybe are set in their ways they don\u2019t do so well. And so I need to get better at this. But if you don\u2019t meet people where they are, then you\u2019ll never get anywhere in conversation. You\u2019ll never get anywhere with communication. You\u2019ll never get anywhere with teaching."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that\u2019s exactly right. And, again, you\u2019re coming back to this theme of translating. And the only way you can translate is if you know where one person is to help translate the information to where they need to be, or you would like to get them. And many people like yourself who are very good at communication say the same thing, that I need to get better. I can get better I know. And so there\u2019s this introspection that comes with good communication, recognizing that there\u2019s more work to be done. And that really motivates what I do in my profession and the core of this podcast, too."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Wow, that\u2019s a tough one because there are so many people that I admire. I\u2019d have to go back to a professor that I had at the undergrad and the grad level. And this professor was someone who taught intellectual history. And he would teach every week a different author, a different philosopher, a different literary figure. And while he was teaching that person he would inhabit them. He would become them. He would stand up on stage and it was as if this person had come back to life."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And some of these people were people that I knew later socially that [he agreed] with profoundly. But he would inhabit them so effectively that you couldn\u2019t but get swept up in the enthusiasm that they had and that they brought to their work. And, of course, these folks were often in contradiction with one another. And I thought, wow, that\u2019s the best way to understand these authors, is to kind of live inside of them."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One of the things that stands out in your answer is this notion of empathy and really understanding the person that you\u2019re talking about teaching, or talking to and teaching. That\u2019s an important skill to have. And I think it would have been great to have learned some of the philosophy and great thinkers I learned from a professor such as the one you had versus the ones I had, which back in the day on acetate bullet points just walking through their points of view. So, clearly, your experience was different than mine."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let me ask question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"I\u2019m going to say level, length, and levity. So when you\u2019re communicating you have to pick the right level. Meaning you don\u2019t want to talk down to people. So part of my podcast I know it\u2019s tough for some people, but I don\u2019t want to talk down to people. But you also don\u2019t want to talk up to people. You have to make sure that the sophistication and complexity of what you\u2019re saying is within the reach of the people that you\u2019re communicating with. That\u2019s number one."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Number two, length. Concision is super-important in a lot of contexts. But in other contexts people really want to go deep. And figuring out the length of someone\u2019s attention span, and calibrating what you\u2019re saying, and the level of granularity, the level of detail, the level of depth with their appetite for comprehension, getting that right is super-important."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"And then the third thing is levity. I like humor. I like using humor. There are situations where humor might be inappropriate, okay, and that needs to be serious. And so you can be too funny \u2014 and I\u2019ve certainly made errors in that direction \u2014 but you can also be too serious. And so getting that balance of inspiring affect. And I guess you could apply it to other emotions because sometimes you want the people you\u2019re communicating with to be a little bit anxious."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"One of the reasons why people sit in the front row is because they want the adrenaline rush of the professor leaning over them. And if you don\u2019t stimulate that by cold calling, then people don\u2019t learn as much. So finding that right emotional balance in communication. If there\u2019s any fear or anxiety or levity that exceeds the proper parameters, then it will interfere with the communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I love, love, love your three Ls. The notion of finding the right level, the right length, and bringing levity in are definitely mantras we can all take into account. And for many of us, just thinking about those going into a communication event I think could really help. Well, Greg, you did not disappoint. Your podcast is called Unsiloed. And I feel like our conversation was unsiloed. That\u2019s exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you for sharing your insight. Thank you for having your podcast be part of the GSB podcast family. And it\u2019s nice to have a fellow podcast host on Faculty. Thank you."},{"author":"Greg LaBlanc","text":"Thank you, Matt. It\u2019s great."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, a podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

So I always encourage students to put what they\u2019re learning into their own words, so that they can explain it back to themselves."]},{"begin":"153.600","end":"179.560","lines":["I think all of us who teach have learned that having to teach something really forces you to learn it in a way that just thinking you know it doesn\u2019t bring you to that same level of knowledge. When it comes to taking numbers and taking data and communicating them, are there certain best practices you encourage your students to think about using analogies, making sure people understand the baseline or base rates? Anything in particular you focus on?"]},{"begin":"179.560","end":"214.920","lines":["We have three different ways of understanding the world. We have the formulaic way that involves complicated explanations. But we also understand things through stories, the narratives. And we also understand things through pictures and images. And those are a little bit deeper. They go back a little further in our evolutionary history. And so I try to encourage everyone to explain every concept in each of those three ways. So you should be well-practiced in switching gears and switching modes of explanation in all three ways."]},{"begin":"214.920","end":"219.040","lines":["So it\u2019s like casting a wide net to bring in as many people as you can."]},{"begin":"219.040","end":"230.640","lines":["Yeah. And I think that even with the same audience member, if they see all three types of explanation they\u2019re going to learn more, than if they\u2019re only exposed to one."]},{"begin":"230.640","end":"255.440","lines":["Absolutely. So getting people to think through different modalities I think absolutely helps them connect better and remember more. And it also forces all of us as communicators to stretch what we\u2019re comfortable with. Because I think many of us gravitate towards one of those three, and that\u2019s just the way we communicate. And by reminding ourselves that we have to leverage more can help us more accurately communicate the information."]},{"begin":"255.440","end":"275.080","lines":["We had our colleague, Rob Siegel, on this podcast a while back and we discussed the challenges and benefits of corporate digital transformation. I\u2019m curious to get your take on how companies and their employees can avoid some of the common pitfalls involved in digital transformation. And I\u2019m going to give you extra credit if you talk about communication in your answer."]},{"begin":"275.080","end":"300.000","lines":["I\u2019m trained as an historian. Historians are always very skeptical when they\u2019re told everything is new, we\u2019re experiencing unprecedented change, and so forth. So we always tend to look back and say, \u201cYou know what? I think we\u2019ve seen this thing before.\u201d So I think that we are undergoing this massive fundamental transformation, but we\u2019ve been through transformations before."]},{"begin":"300.000","end":"324.760","lines":["And I think to be a good manager you have to be a change manager. It doesn\u2019t take a Stanford MBA to sit on top of a steady state and to just administer some inputs and outputs. To be someone who can change that function and radically transform things, that\u2019s really the most difficult aspect of business. And so I think that management today is increasingly change management."]},{"begin":"324.760","end":"353.640","lines":["Now that said, of course, the specifics of digital transformation are really about understanding how to match organizational architecture with the technology. And if you bolt on new technologies to existing organizational architecture, existing incentive structures, existing cultures, then you\u2019re going to have a Frankenstein monster company. So it\u2019s really about the management and the technology and how they fit."]},{"begin":"353.640","end":"377.160","lines":["So it sounds like we over-index on the technology and we don\u2019t think about the actual specific, interpersonal, managerial, day-to-day interaction piece. And, of course, when you talk about change management you\u2019re talking about communication. How do we align people? How do we articulate clear goals, or key performance indicators? How do we get people in lockstep?"]},{"begin":"377.160","end":"387.600","lines":["Have you, in your classes or in your experience as a consultant, seen that there are certain traps that people fall into beyond not seeing the change management piece?"]},{"begin":"387.600","end":"408.640","lines":["Yeah. One of the reasons why I chose the term unsiloed for my podcast is because I\u2019m a big believer in, I don\u2019t way to say multitasking, but being multilingual. Being able to understand the discourse of different disciplines within the academy, but also understanding the different discourses of the different functional areas within a business."]},{"begin":"408.640","end":"435.120","lines":["So I think many poorly run organizations have people that are overly specialized and they lack the capacity to communicate with people in different functional areas. Oftentimes, the people who are on the tech side of the business can\u2019t talk to the folks on the business side of the business and vice versa. So I think that in today\u2019s world to be a successful business person, successful manager, successful executive you have to be bilingual, trilingual, quadrilingual."]},{"begin":"435.120","end":"466.160","lines":["And you have to be able to translate. So you have to be able to translate what\u2019s going on on the tech side of the business to the folks who are less tech savvy. And you also need to be able to translate the business objectives to the folks who are in the tech trenches. And if you can do that \u2014 and sometimes I wonkishly say that\u2019s like being a human API \u2014 if you can be the human API within the organization who is the connector, the translator, then you will, ultimately, be indispensable and, ultimately, super-successful."]},{"begin":"466.160","end":"502.960","lines":["I like that notion of human API being that interface that connects and translates. I recently interviewed a senior leader at the company that includes cliff notes, because I was interested in how do you relay complex information in a concise way. And he convinced me that it\u2019s not just the transmission of information, it\u2019s really about translating that information appropriately for the audience that you\u2019re working with and talking to. And that\u2019s exactly what you just said. As managers, as leaders part of our job is to translate information, rather than just broadcast information. I think that\u2019s really important."]},{"begin":"502.960","end":"516.880","lines":["You are clearly a master teacher. You have won numerous teaching awards. Can you share some of your insights and teaching tactics you use that could help all of us as we mentor colleagues and pass along information in our work?"]},{"begin":"516.880","end":"550.520","lines":["Well, those are some nice, kind words. I always think that there\u2019s room for improvement in the world of teaching. But I think when it comes to teaching you have to start with respect. You have to respect your students. You have to respect where they\u2019re coming from. You have to respect what they bring to the table. And you have to understand that you\u2019re going to learn from them. And if you walk into the teaching experience with a view to learning, then I think that you\u2019ll be successful as a teacher."]},{"begin":"550.520","end":"574.080","lines":["At Berkeley, where I also teach, one of the mottos is students always. So you\u2019re going to be a student for the rest of your life. And if I can go in and add to that, I would add a fifth defining principle, which is teachers always. And being a teacher is being a student. I started in a Montessori school. I did Montessori through the third grade. And I knew when I was about three-years-old when I started Montessori school that I wanted to be a teacher."]},{"begin":"574.080","end":"596.280","lines":["Because in Montessori school, as soon as you learn something you have to turn to the people next to you and you have to teach them. And maybe you start teaching them before you\u2019ve even fully-ingested what it is that you\u2019re learning. And then as you start teaching it, what you encounter on the other side of that teaching interface helps you, then, to go back and learn better."]},{"begin":"596.280","end":"610.840","lines":["And so I really believe in that Montessori approach. It sort of informed everything that I\u2019ve done. So to be a teacher you have to be a good student. I think that\u2019s the one overarching principle and rule that I would recommend to every teacher."]},{"begin":"610.840","end":"633.600","lines":["And while it makes sense intuitively, I think a lot of people who find themselves in positions where they are teaching people feel like they have to be the expert. Like I have to know this, and I know something you don\u2019t know. And that sets up a very different relationship than what you\u2019re talking about, which is I have some things that I\u2019ve learned that I can pass to you, and you have some experiences you\u2019ve learned that you can pass to me. It\u2019s much more collaborative."]},{"begin":"633.600","end":"655.960","lines":["So while it sounds intuitive and makes sense, I think a lot of us who find ourselves in teaching positions don\u2019t always adopt that point of view. And the first thing you said when I asked the question, you said you really have to understand where your students, your recipients, the people you\u2019re mentoring are coming from, so that you can adjust and adapt. And that\u2019s a theme that we\u2019ve heard lots on this podcast. You have to know who you\u2019re speaking to and how to adjust to that audience."]},{"begin":"655.960","end":"688.640","lines":["I want to turn now to your podcast. When you and I first met I was in awe of the number of episodes you do and how frequently you do them, and the amount of reading that you do to prepare yourself. You do several episodes a week and you read several books a week. I am a very slow, methodical reader. I always have been. It\u2019s been a challenge for me. What advice do you have to help people read more quickly, or take in information more quickly and make it actionable? Because you clearly do that well. How do you do it? I want to learn personally."]},{"begin":"688.640","end":"704.880","lines":["The skill that I\u2019ve developed is one that I encourage students to develop. And I think part of what you\u2019re learning in graduate school is you\u2019re learning how to process information more quickly and effectively. And to somehow take this firehose of information that\u2019s coming in from all directions and make sense of it."]},{"begin":"704.880","end":"737.600","lines":["And so if you have frameworks and theories and models, these are preexisting structures, which allow you to, as the information comes in in real-time you can sort it into different buckets. I like to talk about like a compression algorithm. If you have an image, if you\u2019re storing a movie and you go from frame to frame, you don\u2019t store every single frame. You just store, okay, what changed when you go from frame two to frame one? And that\u2019s a tiny, tiny bit of incremental information."]},{"begin":"737.600","end":"768.200","lines":["So when I\u2019m reading books I\u2019m looking for, okay, what\u2019s new here? What lines up with what I already know and that I\u2019ve already seen? And I just check that box and say, \u201cOkay. This person is using this, this, this and this. And this framework to structure, this theory,\u201d etcetera. And then, boom! When I see the new stuff that\u2019s when my eyes light up. So I\u2019m reading the entire book, I\u2019m reading every word, but if it\u2019s familiar it flows very, very smoothly. And then I slow down when I see the stuff that is new."]},{"begin":"768.200","end":"788.840","lines":["So part of what I\u2019m hearing you say is that when you\u2019re reading you\u2019re synthesizing and prioritizing and packaging the information according to framework structures and theories that you\u2019ve already had in place. And that\u2019s really insightful for me, because I do that retrospectively, not concurrently. If I\u2019m done reading something I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, that links here.\u201d"]},{"begin":"788.840","end":"810.440","lines":["And what I\u2019m hearing you say is you\u2019re doing it in real-time. And I can see how that can help me, and I can imagine it would help many of our listeners, especially when you\u2019re taking on new content or if you\u2019re new to the language that you\u2019re learning it in. If you can think about those heuristics in frameworks and apply them in the moment that can really help. I think you\u2019ve just made my life easier. I can read more quickly now."]},{"begin":"810.440","end":"818.120","lines":["Well, you know we like to end this podcast by asking the same three questions of everybody. So now it\u2019s your turn. Are you up for answering the questions?"]},{"begin":"818.120","end":"820.160","lines":["Yeah. I\u2019ll give it a try."]},{"begin":"820.160","end":"831.560","lines":["All right. You\u2019re going to do great. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five to seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"831.560","end":"861.640","lines":["I think it would be meet them where they are. I think it was Ignatius Loyola that is famous for having said this first. And I had spent some time at a Jesuit high school, and maybe that\u2019s where I picked it up. But the idea is that people are where they are when you first encounter them. And they\u2019re not going to be where you wish they were. That\u2019s why I would say that I don\u2019t think of myself as a great communicator because I have a long way to go with respect to this principle."]},{"begin":"861.640","end":"884.120","lines":["I communicate best when I encounter people who enter the interaction with a lot of curiosity. And when I meet people that maybe are set in their ways they don\u2019t do so well. And so I need to get better at this. But if you don\u2019t meet people where they are, then you\u2019ll never get anywhere in conversation. You\u2019ll never get anywhere with communication. You\u2019ll never get anywhere with teaching."]},{"begin":"884.120","end":"915.240","lines":["I think that\u2019s exactly right. And, again, you\u2019re coming back to this theme of translating. And the only way you can translate is if you know where one person is to help translate the information to where they need to be, or you would like to get them. And many people like yourself who are very good at communication say the same thing, that I need to get better. I can get better I know. And so there\u2019s this introspection that comes with good communication, recognizing that there\u2019s more work to be done. And that really motivates what I do in my profession and the core of this podcast, too."]},{"begin":"915.240","end":"922.080","lines":["Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator you admire, and why?"]},{"begin":"922.080","end":"954.920","lines":["Wow, that\u2019s a tough one because there are so many people that I admire. I\u2019d have to go back to a professor that I had at the undergrad and the grad level. And this professor was someone who taught intellectual history. And he would teach every week a different author, a different philosopher, a different literary figure. And while he was teaching that person he would inhabit them. He would become them. He would stand up on stage and it was as if this person had come back to life."]},{"begin":"954.920","end":"981.480","lines":["And some of these people were people that I knew later socially that [he agreed] with profoundly. But he would inhabit them so effectively that you couldn\u2019t but get swept up in the enthusiasm that they had and that they brought to their work. And, of course, these folks were often in contradiction with one another. And I thought, wow, that\u2019s the best way to understand these authors, is to kind of live inside of them."]},{"begin":"981.480","end":"1013.120","lines":["One of the things that stands out in your answer is this notion of empathy and really understanding the person that you\u2019re talking about teaching, or talking to and teaching. That\u2019s an important skill to have. And I think it would have been great to have learned some of the philosophy and great thinkers I learned from a professor such as the one you had versus the ones I had, which back in the day on acetate bullet points just walking through their points of view. So, clearly, your experience was different than mine."]},{"begin":"1013.120","end":"1020.960","lines":["Let me ask question number three. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1020.960","end":"1047.080","lines":["I\u2019m going to say level, length, and levity. So when you\u2019re communicating you have to pick the right level. Meaning you don\u2019t want to talk down to people. So part of my podcast I know it\u2019s tough for some people, but I don\u2019t want to talk down to people. But you also don\u2019t want to talk up to people. You have to make sure that the sophistication and complexity of what you\u2019re saying is within the reach of the people that you\u2019re communicating with. That\u2019s number one."]},{"begin":"1047.080","end":"1071.440","lines":["Number two, length. Concision is super-important in a lot of contexts. But in other contexts people really want to go deep. And figuring out the length of someone\u2019s attention span, and calibrating what you\u2019re saying, and the level of granularity, the level of detail, the level of depth with their appetite for comprehension, getting that right is super-important."]},{"begin":"1071.440","end":"1101.320","lines":["And then the third thing is levity. I like humor. I like using humor. There are situations where humor might be inappropriate, okay, and that needs to be serious. And so you can be too funny \u2014 and I\u2019ve certainly made errors in that direction \u2014 but you can also be too serious. And so getting that balance of inspiring affect. And I guess you could apply it to other emotions because sometimes you want the people you\u2019re communicating with to be a little bit anxious."]},{"begin":"1101.320","end":"1126.160","lines":["One of the reasons why people sit in the front row is because they want the adrenaline rush of the professor leaning over them. And if you don\u2019t stimulate that by cold calling, then people don\u2019t learn as much. So finding that right emotional balance in communication. If there\u2019s any fear or anxiety or levity that exceeds the proper parameters, then it will interfere with the communication."]},{"begin":"1126.160","end":"1162.880","lines":["Well, I love, love, love your three Ls. The notion of finding the right level, the right length, and bringing levity in are definitely mantras we can all take into account. And for many of us, just thinking about those going into a communication event I think could really help. Well, Greg, you did not disappoint. Your podcast is called Unsiloed. And I feel like our conversation was unsiloed. That\u2019s exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you for sharing your insight. Thank you for having your podcast be part of the GSB podcast family. And it\u2019s nice to have a fellow podcast host on Faculty. Thank you."]},{"begin":"1162.880","end":"1166.320","lines":["Thank you, Matt. It\u2019s great."]},{"begin":"1166.320","end":"1203.240","lines":["Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, a podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.
