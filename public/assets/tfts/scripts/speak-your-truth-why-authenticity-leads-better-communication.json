{"title":"Speak Your Truth: Why Authenticity Leads to Better Communication","url":"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/speak-your-truth-why-authenticity-leads-better-communication","intro":["From the way you communicate to the way you build your life and career, Graham Weaver, MBA '99, says it's about \u201cgiving yourself permission to fully be yourself. You can never go wrong when you're saying your truth.\u201d","Weaver is a lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business and founder/partner of Alpine Investors. He stresses the importance of direct communication, highlighting how avoiding it can lead to wasted time, energy, and even financial losses. Reflecting on his own experiences in private equity, Weaver admits to struggling with being conflict-averse and not speaking his truth directly. This resulted in getting into bad deals and big losses.","\u201cPeople think that by being indirect, they're being kind, but all they're doing is creating confusion,\u201d Weaver says. \u201cClarity is compassionate. Even if it's not what they want to hear, the more direct and clear you can be, the more compassionate that is for the other person.\u201d","Additionally, Weaver says many of us waste our time trying to live other people's truths instead of our own. \u201cYou're going to be a C+ version of someone else, but you can be an A+ version of yourself. And that's enough.\u201d","In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Weaver and host Matt Abrahams explore how being true to oneself not only fosters personal fulfillment but also enables us to show up better for others. Authenticity and self-belief lay the foundation for effective communication, leadership, and, ultimately, success."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The best communicators and the best leaders start by focusing within. It\u2019s about being present and connected."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today, I look forward to speaking with Graham Weaver. Graham is a lecturer in management at the GSB, as well as a GSB alum. He teaches managing growing enterprises and managerial skills. Graham is a very popular teacher and has been invited multiple times to present in the graduation last lecture series."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Graham, thanks for being here."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[00:38]: Thanks so much for having me, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I look forward to the conversation. Are you ready to get started?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Let\u2019s do this."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:43]: All right. You teach managing growing enterprises. What are two takeaways from your class that would help our listeners and their companies as they seek to grow and scale?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So number one would be the power of really direct communication. So this sounds so cliche that I even hate to say it. But people just waste time and energy and money by being indirect. They think that by, uh, being indirect or being kind, but all they\u2019re doing is creating confusion. So I\u2019ll give you an example for us at Alpine. You know, I really struggled with this. I\u2019m very conflict averse, I don\u2019t like, you know, saying something that\u2019s going to upset someone. So for a lot of times I would dance around things and it led us to do some bad deals because I just was kind of like, what do you think? Are you sure you think this is a good deal? You know, kind of like that when, what I was really saying is I hate this deal."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Um-hmm."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[01:35]: I just couldn\u2019t be that direct and literally I am that direct now. And that cost us millions of dollars in the early years where I just wasn\u2019t comfortable saying my truth. And so in this class, we just do this over and over again, where we get students in the habit of saying your truth. You can never go wrong when you\u2019re saying what is true. And then we talk about how to do that in a way where people can feel safe and valued. But you still got to lead with that truth. So that\u2019s probably the biggest."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"The second one is going to be completely different. And so when I started teaching this class for a number of years, I would teach this class on entrepreneurship. And then I realized that people learn all these tools about entrepreneurship, but no one would actually go become an entrepreneur. Even though that\u2019s their vision, that\u2019s what they wrote on their essay, that\u2019s what they wanted to do. So I realized there\u2019s another part of this class, which is, hey, what is going to stand in the way of you actually going and pursuing your dream? And so I added this entire component to the class, which is two things."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"First is let\u2019s spend time and energy with students on really getting them to understand what their dream is. What would they do if they knew they wouldn\u2019t fail? What are their superpowers? What is the thing that is easy for them that\u2019s hard for other people or that feels like play for them? That\u2019s work for others or you know, like we spent a lot of time helping them really understand it and a lot of times it\u2019s not the standard, you know, thing that is pitched here. Like it\u2019s not the consulting job. It\u2019s something very, very different. So getting them really clear on that."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[03:05] And then, this is really critical, is they get flooded then with all these limiting beliefs. Not me, not now, I don\u2019t have an experience. I might fail. How do I raise money? How do I pay off my loans? I can\u2019t do this. You know, my roommate\u2019s brother tried this and failed, all these things flood in almost immediately."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And we actually take, we have a whole class where we take those limiting beliefs. We put them down, we look at them in the cold light of day and we start dealing with them, because if you, we got to name them because limiting beliefs is really fear and it has more power when it\u2019s just in the recesses of your subconscious mind. So we get it down, we look at it and we try to overcome it. So those are two things that, very different, direct communication, and then, um, you know, figuring out your limiting beliefs and overcoming those that might help people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[03:53]: I find it really interesting that in a class about enterprises, what you\u2019re really talking about are interpersonal skills and intrapersonal information. I think that for everybody to think for a moment, what would you do if failure wasn\u2019t limiting you? I think that\u2019s a wonderful way to get people to reframe what they\u2019re doing. And I love that you are taking time to have people call up those limiting beliefs because you can\u2019t address things you\u2019re not consciously aware of."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So I\u2019m fifty-one now and I\u2019ve been in private equity twenty-nine years. I\u2019ve gone, you know, I went to Stanford at, I teach here. And the longer that life goes on for me, the more I realize that most of this game we\u2019re playing is really an internal game first and foremost. And it presents itself as this external game where, you know, we have to do all these things and pay off debt and all this, but it really starts with being an internal game. And the more you can master that, first, you know, the more success you\u2019re going to have in almost no matter what you do externally. At some point, you\u2019re going to have to master that internal game."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[04:58]: Absolutely. And I think I see that in the work I do. You know, we, a lot of what we do is focus on how you message things externally. But it really starts with what\u2019s going on in your own head, in your own mind."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You recently delivered a GSB Last Lecture on living an asymmetrical life and congrats, by the way, it\u2019s quite an honor to speak at a Last Lecture. What do you mean by an asymmetrical life and how can we achieve that?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Well, I use the analogy of investing after being a professional investor for twenty-nine years, you end up with these wildly asymmetric outcomes. So you don\u2019t end up with like a whole bunch of, you know, two or three X deals. You end up with some okay ones and then some just gargantuan home runs. If you look at Warren Buffett, for example, I think through 1988, he had half of his public market gains that in his whole history were from two stocks, Geico and Washington Post."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So you end up with these wildly asymmetric outcomes, which you can explain when you say, okay, you got this criteria, right? You had the right market, the right management team, a big enough TAM, high returns on invested capital. You figured out a way to buy companies. You have a playbook, you know, and each time you stack another one of those, you\u2019re creating like logarithmic type outcomes, not linear. And the more you stack on, the more logarithmic it becomes. So then I started looking at my own life and kind of looking at it through that lens of what could create asymmetric outcomes in life. And I came up with four things."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[06:16]: So the first one is do hard things. And the reason that\u2019s on there is that the thing that is keeping you where you are from your next plateau is something that you either don\u2019t want to do or you fear. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re stuck where you are right now. It\u2019s one of those two things, maybe both, probably both. And if you go after that thing, generally speaking, your life is going to get worse first."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So if your thing, for example, is that you need to end a relationship that\u2019s not going well, you know, if you just woke up tomorrow and stayed in the relationship, everything\u2019s fine. But if, but five years from now, it\u2019s going to be worse. But if you wake up tomorrow instead and do the hard thing, have the hard conversation, have the breakup, you\u2019re going to be lonely. You\u2019re going to have to, you know, have that difficulty, but then you\u2019re going to emerge and get to that next plateau. So that applies to everything. And I had this quote that I like to say, which is everything you want in this life is on the other side of worse first."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[07:12] And the second one is, so number one is do hard things. Number two is do your thing. And so you\u2019re not going to be amazing at this life trying to live someone else\u2019s life. And when you find that thing that you are really excited about, you just show up differently. I worked at a job, you know, I took the safe job when I graduated from school and I just felt a part of me die."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And if you had asked me at the time, when I was in that job, what percent of your potential are you unleashing right now, Graham? I probably would have said like, oh, sixty, seventy percent. Now that I\u2019m actually doing the thing I want to be doing, I look back and I\u2019d say, no, it\u2019s more like four percent. And so when you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re excited about, that\u2019s your thing, you\u2019re just going to show up differently."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And importantly, you\u2019re going to stay with it for a lot longer, which is really the key, which is point three, which is do it for decades. Do your thing for a long time. Like the you\u2019re, if you are getting a little, even a little bit better. We have CEOs who have been running their company for fifteen years and they are better in year fifteen than they were in fourteen, better in fourteen than they were in thirteen. And you know, fifteen years in, when you\u2019re improving, you can be the best in the world at something. But you have to, but it goes into doing hard things, doing your thing, and then you will be more likely to do it for decades."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[08:18] And the fourth one, which kind of sits on top of everything is write your story. So what most people do, if you ask them to write a book about their life, they would look back, and they would kind of start talking about these events, almost like the events happened to them. And then this happened, and then this happened, and this happened. We have managers, by the way, who do this. Oh yeah, how\u2019d your quarter go? Well, this happened, and then this happened, and this happened. It\u2019s like, well, what if you just did it the other way around? What if you write the story first, that you want to have happen?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Why don\u2019t you just do that? Like, just starting today, from wherever you are, write your story about what you want the story to be for the next five, ten, fifteen, twenty, or your life, you know, you write that story and then make that story happen. And the magical thing happens is the more clear you can get on that story, the more likely it\u2019s going to be to happen. So those are the four things that I feel like if you stack those on top of each other, you can have, you know, basically anything that you want in this life."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[09:16]: I love that it\u2019s a playbook and I love that it\u2019s all about initiative and willing to go through the hard stuff to get to the good stuff, and plotting a course in advance of actually doing it to sort of focus you, but also set expectations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And in what you said, I heard a lot of, just get to it. Don\u2019t waste time. And I love this idea of an asymmetrical life and I hope everybody listening thinks about those four steps and considers, you know, addressing them, maybe not in that order, maybe not right away. But put yourself on a path to do that."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Any one of those steps will improve your life dramatically. Any of those four. If you just do hard things, if you just do your thing, if you just write your story, any one of those will make a dramatic difference in your life. But if you run the table on all four, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. You can unlock just about anything you want."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[10:10]: I love your passion. I love your ideas. And I see that in your blogs, I enjoy reading your blogs, it\u2019s a lot of fun. Uh, you\u2019re a very engaging writer and I learn a lot from them as I\u2019m learning from our conversation. I have to say, I was struck by one of your blogs that was all about you attending a Taylor Swift concert. And I\u2019m really curious to have you share with our audience the lessons you learned while you were grooving and shaking it off with Taylor Swift."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"That\u2019s my favorite song, actually, Shake It Off by Taylor Swift. So in 2018, Taylor Swift was snubbed for the Grammys, you know, she wasn\u2019t nominated and there\u2019s this video of her where she is on the phone with her agent and she is just crestfallen. And like, you just watch all the energy drain from her face. And then right after that, she goes through this really tough public, uh, disaster with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian about, you know, can she use lyric or can they use her lyrics on the song? And does she approve it?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And there, and the number one trending hashtag on Twitter. Number one, was Taylor Swift is over. Can you imagine being her at that point? You\u2019re like in your twenties and the number one trending hashtag in the world is your demise. That\u2019s how much people have this venom."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[11:24] And so what does she do? Okay. She, you know, what would most people do? They\u2019d probably go, you know, they\u2019d probably have this thing. I\u2019m a victim. I have, you know, I\u2019m going to blame, you know, Kanye West and the, you know, this woe is me. And she probably had moments where she felt some of that. I\u2019m sure she did."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"But instead she said, you know what? I just need to make a better record. That\u2019s what she said. She says that on film. I guess I need to make a better record. And so between 2018 and 2022, she put out more songs than she ever did in her whole life, on the back of that. And I guarantee there were days when she just had the covers over her, didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. But she put her helmet on, goes to work and just put one foot in front of the other and did it again and again and again. And then she won more awards for the work she did in that time period than any other time she\u2019s had in her life. And I think, you know, people don\u2019t see that. They just see her in her concert and it\u2019s a billion-dollar concert. And here\u2019s all these lights and wow, what a great dancer. And she\u2019s got so much music, but my all-time favorite quote, I write quotes on my board every day in class. I\u2019m a huge collector of quotes. I post them almost every day on social media. My all-time favorite quote, Michelangelo, you know, uh, sculpted the David paints The Sistine Chapel and he says, if people knew how hard I worked to gain my mastery, it wouldn\u2019t seem so wonderful. And I think people see Taylor Swift\u2019s mastery, but they don\u2019t see all the stuff that went into it. Anyway, I\u2019m inspired by everything she does, but I just thought that one story of her is really just a story of grit. It\u2019s not about talent or, you know, her music or anything. It\u2019s just about like her just and her resolve. Anyway, she\u2019s one of my heroes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[13:04]: I think that notion, uh, well, one, I think it\u2019s great that, that you take a lesson beyond just the fun and enjoyment of her music. But the tenacity and the belief in yourself. And just hunkering down and doing it. I think there\u2019s a lesson for all of us. And the point about mastery is really fascinating. We\u2019ve, we had a whole episode about mastery and really what goes into it. And it\u2019s a lot of work and it\u2019s a lot of things that people don\u2019t see. You write a lot about your desire to continue growing and improving."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"What\u2019s one thing that you\u2019re working on right now?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So, yeah, great question. So, uh, I had this really interesting conversation with my, a friend of mine a couple of years ago. And we were just. kind of having a banter and she asked me, she said, you know, if you, if you could have one superpower, what would that be?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And so I was kind of like, oh, that\u2019d be kind of cool to read someone\u2019s mind or, you know, whatever. And I was playing, and then, and all of a sudden it got a little bit deeper. And I said, well, what is actually a superpower I could really develop? And what I came up with, the word I came up with was, you know, enlightenment, you know, what if I were just more enlightened, you know, \u2018cause what I started to realize and I think this is true for everybody is, you know, your whole life is unfolding as externally and there\u2019s events and there\u2019s situations. And then that life goes through a filter, which is your mind."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[14:22] And then what you\u2019re processing is your interpretation of those events. So this thing happened, is this good? Is this bad? Is this consistent with what I thought was going to happen? Am I upset about this? You know, do I feel good about this? You know, what, what\u2019s the story I have about how my life is supposed to go?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"What\u2019s the story I have about what\u2019s, you know, what\u2019s going to make me happy or successful or what\u2019s the story I have about other people think about me. And like, I just started to realize like all of that story I\u2019m creating myself and that filter is like pretty much a hundred percent in my control. And so a lot more of my life is in my control than I realize. So I started going on this journey, which has been amazing. So I\u2019ve been studying a lot of Buddhism, I\u2019ve been going on meditation retreats, doing journaling and coaching. I\u2019ve been meditating a lot more than I ever did. And it is the best journey, I think probably, maybe the most important journey that anyone could go on. So I\u2019m not there, I\u2019m not a enlightened individual, I don\u2019t know if I ever will be, but I definitely am at least getting closer than maybe I was before I started this journey."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[15:24]: I appreciate you sharing that because that for many people, that\u2019s a very personal quest and the tools that you\u2019re using are tools that I personally do a lot of meditating and reflecting. And I find there is a lot of value in it. And I think in a world that we live in and a place that we live in, we can get very distracted by lots of shiny objects and ideas and to really ground ourselves. I like that."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"You know, it\u2019s kind of like for me at least, it\u2019s kind of like brushing your teeth. You know, you can\u2019t just brush your teeth for eight hours on January 1st and then say I\u2019m good for the year, you know?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like almost like I start over every single morning and have to kind of reprogram and meditate, take a cold shower, you know, write in the journal, do it again. But it does, it has made a huge difference."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[16:08]: Before we end, Graham, I\u2019d like to ask you some questions. The first question I\u2019m going to make up specifically for you, and then the others are common questions I ask everybody. You up for that?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Let\u2019s do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[16:17]: So number one, uh, you\u2019re a leader. You teach new leaders and work with many. What differentiates an exceptional leader from just an average leader?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"I would say ultimately, when you get past all the tactical things, the very, very exceptional leaders give themselves permission to fully be themselves."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[00:16:36] So I\u2019ll give you a very simple example in my own life. So I started, I was asked to teach at Stanford Business School. And so my first couple of years, I went and watched all the amazing professors here and learn and wrote notes and everything. And for the first few years, I really tried to mimic them."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And, you know, Irv Grousbeck was a mentor of mine. And so I tried to do everything that he did. And I didn\u2019t do very well at all. And at some point, I had this conversation with my executive coach who said, you know, Graham, you\u2019re going to be a C plus version of Irv Grousbeck. But you can be an A plus version of Graham Weaver and that\u2019s enough. And I think it was the that\u2019s enough part that I didn\u2019t believe, which is why I was trying to mimic someone else. And so I think, you know, if you\u2019re in a leadership role, you\u2019re there for a reason, you know, you are an incredibly special person and you\u2019re different than anyone else. And those differences are what make you amazing. And giving yourself permission to fully be yourself is going to be where you\u2019re this incredible light and you\u2019re going to do something different than someone has, you know, someone has never done before. And so I think it is that permission and it is realizing like that\u2019s enough."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[17:53]: That\u2019s really powerful that we just need to be ourselves and through being ourselves, we can succeed in teaching and leadership and lots of other areas, but we get in our own way."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Question number two, who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"I\u2019ll go with, um, Irv Grousbeck who teaches here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[18:13]: So Irv, I think he\u2019s been teaching here for thirty-five, forty years. And he was a very successful businessman before that. Probably best known for owning the Celtics or being one of the owners of the Boston Celtics."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"Anyway, he was my professor here. I was a case guest in his class for twelve years. And he was also the one who got me into teaching. In terms of his communication, he just models exactly what I would want to teach others and what I want to do for myself. He\u2019s super direct. He\u2019s clear, he\u2019s authentic, he\u2019s himself."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"And then like when you\u2019re in his presence, you just feel like you\u2019re the most important person in the world and that you\u2019re the only person in the world. For that period of time, when you\u2019re with him, he just makes you feel that way. And he\u2019s always been the voice of, you can do this and I believe in you. And that, that might sound cliche, but when there\u2019s someone like that, that you admire in your early twenties and trying to start a business and it\u2019s not going that well. You know, having someone like that just kind of keep you grounded and reminding you that you got this, you know, he\u2019s just been unbelievable. So, he would be the person I\u2019d pick."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[19:18]: Yeah. So Irv has got quite the reputation around here. And many people say and share exactly what you did is when you\u2019re speaking with him, you are in that spotlight and feel that it is just you and him in that conversation. And that\u2019s a very powerful thing to feel like you have somebody\u2019s full attention and that they\u2019re really there for you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Final question. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"So the first one would be understanding what is your truth? What is your truth? What do you want to say about this situation? Getting clear on that. Giving yourself a little bit of space where you\u2019re not reacting, but you\u2019re kind of realizing what is your highest value and what is the thing you want to say? And then speak that truth is number one."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[20:06] Two would be create safety. You know, people are going to hear that feedback when they\u2019re safe. And you know, the opposite of that would be they\u2019re not going to hear anything if they feel attacked or they feel belittled or something. So focus on you know, Matt, the reason I want to address this with you is I really care about our relationship. And I want to see what\u2019s it\u2019s coming for a long period of time, you know that that\u2019s what I mean by safety."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm hmm."},{"author":"Graham Weaver","text":"[20:29]: And then third is be clear on what you\u2019re asking So like we\u2019re having a conversation. So what, you know? What is the specific thing that I\u2019m asking of you or what are the next action items? People forget that and they leave thinking they had this whole conversation. The other person\u2019s like, oh yeah, that was lovely, but they missed the whole point. So I think those are, those would be the three. And I think clarity is compassionate. So the more clear, even if it\u2019s not what they want to hear, the more direct and clear you can be, the more compassionate that is for the other person."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[21:05]: I love that idea of clarity leads to compassion. It\u2019s operationalized, uh, compassion in some way. Uh, as you have alluded to in many of your responses, it\u2019s really about introspection first. What\u2019s your truth? What needs to be done? And that is striking. And I want to make sure everybody hears that, that you are better with others when you are first true to yourself and know what that is. And then being clear and creating safe space for you to have those conversations. Graham, this has been fantastic."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really appreciate the opportunity to chat with you. The idea that we have to look within before we manage people externally really makes sense. I love your energy. I love that you both meditate and love Taylor Swift and that you can learn from both.

So the more clear, even if it\u2019s not what they want to hear, the more direct and clear you can be, the more compassionate that is for the other person."]},{"begin":"1264.760","end":"1295.120","lines":["[21:05]: I love that idea of clarity leads to compassion. It\u2019s operationalized, uh, compassion in some way. Uh, as you have alluded to in many of your responses, it\u2019s really about introspection first. What\u2019s your truth? What needs to be done? And that is striking. And I want to make sure everybody hears that, that you are better with others when you are first true to yourself and know what that is. And then being clear and creating safe space for you to have those conversations. Graham, this has been fantastic."]},{"begin":"1295.120","end":"1311.920","lines":["I really appreciate the opportunity to chat with you.
