I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast. I can remember to the weekend when I was a young boy that I discovered how cool persuasion can be."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My mother had instructed my brother and me to create garage-sale signs, but we needed to misspell them. She instructed us to insert a B in the middle of the word \u201cgarage.\u201d So unlike all of our neighbors that weekend who were having garage sales, we were having a garbage sale. At the end of the day, we sold more stuff than anyone else."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My mother proudly asserts that it was the \u201cgarbage\u201d that drew people\u2019s attention to our sign and, thus, to our garage sale. Now I, of course, upon reflection, think people just thought we were stupid and they\u2019d get better deals. Regardless, I learned that day that persuasion and how you influence people can be affected by the language and communication you use."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And when you think about it, much of our communication involves trying to influence others. If you\u2019re trying to pitch a new idea, get support for an important cause or even get your kids to eat their vegetables, then persuasion is the name of the game."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today I am really excited to be joined by Zakary Tormala, the Laurence W. Lane professor of behavioral science and marketing at the GSB. Zakary teaches popular courses of persuasion and attitude, and his research provides valuable insights into how to be more effective in your influence."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Zakary. I have to say it is great to have worked with you on several programs at the GSB, and I really appreciate your passion for teaching and providing practical tips and tools. I\u2019m excited for our conversation."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah, I\u2019m excited to be here. Thanks a lot for having me, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. So let\u2019s go ahead and get started. I\u2019d like to ask you to share how you think about persuasion. What\u2019s your definition?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. That\u2019s, I think, a great starting point. In general, I think of persuasion in terms of the efforts we make to shape or shift people in their attitudes, their beliefs and behaviors. So it\u2019s not really about tricking people into doing what you want or into buying your product, and it\u2019s definitely not about forcing people to act or behave in a certain way."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"It\u2019s more about understanding the factors that actually engage people or open them up to your ideas and input and maybe get them to see something, some issue or some entity, a little bit differently. So that\u2019s how I think about it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve studied lots of important features of persuasive communication that can help us to become more effective. To begin, you\u2019ve looked at the impact of engagement on persuasion. How does engagement influence persuasion? And what are some of the things we can do to increase engagement?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Engagement basically refers to how much attention people pay to you and your message. So it\u2019s a way of thinking about how interested they are in it, how deeply people will think about it. And it\u2019s important because engagement facilitates your message\u2019s impact."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So you could have a great message or argument or a compelling, say, candidate or offer; but if people aren\u2019t willing to attend to that or think about it, they\u2019re going to miss it. You\u2019re not going to reach them. And so engagement is really about getting people to pay attention to what you have to say. And not surprisingly, you can have more impact when they\u2019re doing that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And that\u2019s got to be really hard, Zakary, in this day and age, where people are constantly bombarded with information. Just getting people to pay attention is hard."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. And the way I think about it is that in situations where it\u2019s harder to get people to pay attention because they\u2019re bombarded and distracted and all these kinds of things, it\u2019s all the more important to know what the research shows about building engagement. So our ability to engage people will be enhanced by knowing what the techniques are, and those techniques become more and more important the less focused people are."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So share with us. What are some of the techniques? I\u2019m dying to learn some because I\u2019ve got two teenagers at home. This will help, I hope."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. Well, good luck. Report back to me. That\u2019s a hard audience. But yeah. So in my research and teaching, I usually emphasize a few core principles. And so one of the big ones is that, from the outset, you have to make it clear that your message is important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And one of the best ways to make it clear that your message is important is by establishing that it\u2019s relevant to your audience. There\u2019s a side of relevance that\u2019s super-intuitive: that people pay more attention to things that are personally relevant to them. That\u2019s not surprising at all. But there are some handy techniques you can use to establish that."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So for example, you can establish relevance by communicating physical and temporal proximity. So those are sort of technical terms that I use to talk about this, but what that really means is that you\u2019re talking about things that are \u2014 they\u2019re urgent. They\u2019re immediate. They\u2019re happening here and now. So physical proximity refers to things that are around you, around your audience \u2014 so in your community, for example."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And temporal proximity means it\u2019s soon or now or current, that sort of thing. And so if you can let your audience know or communicate that the issue at hand, whatever it is you\u2019re talking about, is relevant because it\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening soon, it\u2019s happening here and nearby, those kinds of things, they\u2019ll generally pay a lot more attention to it. They\u2019ll find it to be more important to them personally, and then they\u2019ll get more engaged. So that\u2019s a big one."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Another big one that we could highlight here is that if you let your audience know at the outset of your message that you\u2019re going to be asking for their opinion or input, or asking them to make a decision of some sort, they\u2019ll generally pay a lot more attention to you. So if following your message you\u2019ll be asking your audience to weigh in in some way, or to make some kind of decision, or to vote, or to do anything like that, let them know up front. People pay much more attention when they know their input or perspective will be requested or invited at the end."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Those tips for engagement, Zakary, are really helpful. Do you have any more rapid-fire advice for getting people engaged?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah, sure. So off the top of my head, here are a few ideas. One thing, is use the word \u201cyou.\u201d When you address your audience as \u201cyou,\u201d using the second person, they tend to perk up and tune in a little bit. So that\u2019s one. Asking questions is another useful device. So rather than making a declarative statement at the outset of your pitch, if you ask your audience a question, that tends to increase their engagement."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"You can also increase engagement by referencing change. So for instance, if I tell you that the guidelines around some health behavior have recently changed, that would cause you to perk up. You want to know what the information is, and you\u2019ll get more engaged and think more carefully. So those are a few off the top of my head: Say \u201cyou,\u201d ask questions, reference change. That causes a sort of spike in engagement that can be useful in persuasion."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. Taken together that\u2019s a really great toolkit for getting people to pay attention and be engaged. I know something else that you\u2019ve done some research in is you\u2019ve looked at the role of certainty and uncertainty and how they play in persuasion. Can you tell us about this and how we can craft messages to take advantage of both certainty and uncertainty?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Sure. Yeah, certainty is a big one. It\u2019s something I have spent a lot of time thinking about, and a lot of my research has focused around that. So the theme with the certainty-focused strategies is that when you know people are with you in principle, they\u2019re on board or they have the belief or attitude or opinion you want them to, try to build up their certainty. And that can be the thing that sort of transforms them from liking your idea to acting on that, buying it, recommending it, and so on."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it\u2019s really about reinforcing that position they already have and strengthening it?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"That\u2019s right, it\u2019s \u2014 yeah. In fact, I think a lot of it is about strengthening it. So we think about certainty as a kind of attitude strength. Like a muscle can be strengthened, so can our beliefs and attitudes and opinions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And then there are specific techniques that have been shown to help boost a person\u2019s feeling of certainty. So for example, once you know somebody is on board with your position, try to help communicate to them that other people are, as well. The more consensus people perceive for their own views, the more certain they tend to feel about those views."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So if you ask me about my opinion towards something, and then I give it to you, and you can tell me that 89 percent of the people you\u2019ve asked have a similar opinion to mine, then I start to feel like: \u201cOh, I really got it right.\u201d That sense of being in the majority gives me a kind of social validation that makes me feel like my assessment was accurate or correct."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Really cool."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So that\u2019s one of the things you can do."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. And so tell us about uncertainty. How does that work?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. So uncertainty is \u2014 it\u2019s actually about getting engagement. So it goes back to the \u201cengagement\u201d question, in a way. But uncertainty, the idea there is that although certainty is a good way to kind of convert an attitude into action, uncertainty is better at getting people to want more information or to think about something."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And so if you can create moments of uncertainty or moments of doubt or wonder in your message, that can make people feel curious. They start thinking something like: \u201cOh, I wonder what\u2019s going on here,\u201d or, \u201cWhy did he say that?\u201d or, \u201cWhat was she going to say there?\u201d People start to be curious and want more information when they have some uncertainty. And so there are ways that you can kind of trigger or induce a little bit of uncertainty as a way to sort of capitalize on that \u2014 you know, to get people pulled in and more interested in the information that you have."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Often when people set out to influence others, they focus on the promoting messages, all the reasons somebody should do or think something. However, there are often strong restraining or resistance forces that come to play that might prevent the adoption of whatever it is you\u2019re trying to persuade people towards."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ll never forget \u2026 I study communication. My wife has got a PhD in psychology. And we could not, for the life of us, get our kids to eat their vegetables when they were younger. And the reason was not that our messages were bad \u2014 you know, \u201cYou\u2019ll grow up strong,\u201d \u201cYour friends and sports heroes do it.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s they didn\u2019t like the way they looked or tasted, and it wasn\u2019t until we changed the thing that was restraining it that we actually got them to actually enjoy eating vegetables. I know you\u2019ve done some research into ways to manage resistance. Can you share some of the best practices you\u2019ve uncovered?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah, sure. Well, I have done some work on resistance. And in general, there\u2019s a healthy amount of research on this topic that kind of highlights the ways you can sidestep or dampen a person\u2019s resistance if you suspect that\u2019s coming."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So some of the things that have been found \u2014 this isn\u2019t just by me but by other people who work on these topics \u2014 is that when you\u2019re suspecting resistance \u2026 So let\u2019s say that you have an audience or a target, and you know they tend to be resistant or they tend to be skeptical or reactant to whatever you say. They\u2019re contrarians, those kinds of folks. Taking a less forceful, more cooperative tone or using more cooperative language can be effective."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So using words like \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201ctogether,\u201d \u201cas a team,\u201d things like that, that sort of create a common in-group \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team here,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same group\u201d \u2014 that tends to open people up. People are generally much more open to in-group members than out-group members. And so using cooperative, nonforceful language can help with that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So inclusive language makes people feel part of the same team, and that opens them up?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"It helps. As long as it\u2019s plausible. And so there would be cases where you try that, and people are thinking, \u201cAre you crazy? We\u2019re not in the same group,\u201d people who are so far apart or divided. But as long as it\u2019s plausible \u2014 so somebody who you do share some commonalities with or you are working toward a common goal with, that kind of thing \u2014 highlighting that and using the right kind of language can lower whatever resistance might normally spike for them. So that\u2019s one thing you can do."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"A kind of related idea is to think about using pro-attitudinal framing. And so when you think about a person\u2019s attitude or opinion, you can usually identify whether it\u2019s positive or negative on some topic. They\u2019re favorable or unfavorable. A pro-attitudinal message is a message that\u2019s on the same side of an issue. So if someone is positive, it\u2019s also positive, not negative. Counter-attitudinal means it\u2019s on the opposite side. And so sometimes when you\u2019re about to disagree with a person, which can be a situation that triggers a lot of resistance"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"You have a decision to make: What should your argument be? Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re making a hiring decision with a colleague at work, and they want to hire a particular candidate who you think is terrible. You could decide to say, \u201cNo, I disagree with that idea. That person is terrible,\u201d but that\u2019s a really counter-attitudinal position, which can trigger some resistance. If somebody is feeling resistant, that\u2019s not going to convince them."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"A softer approach is to use a pro-attitudinal message. So maybe they think this potential hire would be great, and you could say something like: \u201cThey\u2019re pretty good. I see some of the good qualities there, but I also have some concerns,\u201d or, \u201cI see some limitations, as well.\u201d"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And so it\u2019s likely that that kind of message triggers less resistance in your colleague because you\u2019re on the same side of the issue, just not as far along as them. And so if you can identify some of those things that are good, maybe starting by pointing that out, \u201cYeah. I see some of the benefits to that particular candidate, some of their unique attributes \u2014\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Aha."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"\u201c\u2014 but I have some concerns\u201d \u2014 people are less resistant. It sounds like you\u2019re on the same side. They become more receptive to you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. I really like that approach because it seems that it reduces the defensiveness that comes with resistance. So the person at least stays engaged and is willing to have the conversation versus shutting off altogether."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"That\u2019s right. I think any time you\u2019re thinking about resistance and how to combat it, you\u2019re really thinking about defensiveness. How can you make people feel less defensive, less threatened by your message, that you\u2019re not trying to say they\u2019re wrong or they\u2019re stupid or something like that? So taking a more open, agreeable, inclusive and cooperative type approach with people generally lowers their resistance, and then you have a chance. At least there\u2019s some wiggle room."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"It\u2019s still hard to persuade people who are feeling resistant; but you might be able to just move them a little bit, and that little bit might be just enough to accomplish the goal that you have. You don\u2019t always need to flip people \u2014 you know, \u201cYou love that candidate. I want you to hate them.\u201d I don\u2019t really need that. I just need you to like them less, and then you won\u2019t want to hire them anymore. And so keeping that in mind, usually you can have more success with little movements, baby steps. And sometimes those can have a big impact."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that\u2019s a really important point: that many of us walk into our persuasive messaging and think it\u2019s all or nothing when, in fact, it\u2019s really a continuum, and a little movement might buy you something in the short term or long term. And I think that\u2019s important for people to keep in mind."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah, I\u2019m a huge fan of little movements \u2014 you know, when you think about persuasion: that yeah, little \u2026 Just remembering that softening a person\u2019s position can have a big outcome is really important. It\u2019s often easier to accomplish and can be just as effective for accomplishing your goal."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So before we end: I like to ask the same three questions of everybody I chat with, so I hope you\u2019re willing to answer these questions."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Okay, let\u2019s do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. So if you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation-slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"\u201cBe Confident but Also Open and Humble.\u201d Wait, let me see. \u201cBe Confident but Also Open \u2014 \u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think you\u2019re close enough. We\u2019ll let you \u2014"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. I got it, yeah. So \u201cBe Confident but Also Open and Humble,\u201d something like that. And that\u2019s not really advice that I got from any one person but more like an amalgam of insight that was passed onto me from different sources."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Question No. 2: Who is a communicator that you admire? And why?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"That\u2019s a good one. My communicator, at least top of mind right now, is Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So I\u2019m a big basketball fan. And living in the Bay Area now for 13 years or so, I\u2019ve gotten pretty swept up in Warrior mania."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"So I pay a lot of attention by default to what\u2019s going on with the team and the coach. But I really like his communication style. I think he has this sweet-spot combination that I was just talking about in the last question: that he presents as calm and confident, but he also shows humility. He also uses humor very effectively to sort of defuse a question or the audience. And so yeah, so I\u2019m going to say I like Steve Kerr. I feel like he seems in control. He seems calm and poised but also open, not arrogant. And he\u2019s funny, and he is engaging and feels trustworthy as a result of all that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m a big fan of his, too. I think you and I both share a passion for basketball, and I think he\u2019s a great choice as a good communicator to admire."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So the third question is: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe, from your perspective?"},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"One would be \u201cGet your audience engaged,\u201d and that is often the first thing that you need to attend to. So if your audience isn\u2019t interested and involved, it\u2019s going to be hard to reach them. So focus on building engagement, especially early on. My No. 2 thing is probably establish your credibility, and I don\u2019t mean here \u2014 I don\u2019t necessarily mean your expertise or your competence, although that\u2019s often important to do."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"But I mean this other stuff that we\u2019ve been talking about. So you should convey that you\u2019re trustworthy, that you\u2019re open and receptive to divergent views. If you can show that you have those kinds of qualities, that you\u2019re open to different perspectives and can be trusted, it\u2019s easier to connect with and reach your audience."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"And then my third thing: I\u2019d probably return to the importance of certainty. So once you know that you\u2019ve got your audience on your side, focus on building their certainty, giving them some sense of conviction and confidence because that\u2019s, as I mentioned before, the catalyst that can sort of transform an attitude into action. It transforms liking your idea or your product to actively supporting it, buying it, recommending it, and those kinds of things. So maybe that is, yeah, not necessarily the first three things but three big things."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Get them engaged, establish your credibility, and then boost their certainty and conviction."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And you just did a very nice job of helping me to wrap up with some of the key takeaways from our conversation today. So I just want to end, Zakary, by thanking you so much. We are leaving with some incredibly helpful best practices for our persuasion. Additionally, I believe the insight into influence that you\u2019ve provided us with will help us become better consumers of the persuasion that we\u2019re exposed to. And for that I thank you, as well. So thanks so much, and I wish you well."},{"author":"Zakary Tormala","text":"Yeah. Thank you, Matt. I really appreciate the opportunity to talk to you

And what are some of the things we can do to increase engagement?"]},{"begin":"158.320","end":"175.280","lines":["Engagement basically refers to how much attention people pay to you and your message. So it\u2019s a way of thinking about how interested they are in it, how deeply people will think about it. And it\u2019s important because engagement facilitates your message\u2019s impact."]},{"begin":"175.280","end":"195.440","lines":["So you could have a great message or argument or a compelling, say, candidate or offer; but if people aren\u2019t willing to attend to that or think about it, they\u2019re going to miss it. You\u2019re not going to reach them. And so engagement is really about getting people to pay attention to what you have to say. And not surprisingly, you can have more impact when they\u2019re doing that."]},{"begin":"195.440","end":"203.920","lines":["And that\u2019s got to be really hard, Zakary, in this day and age, where people are constantly bombarded with information. Just getting people to pay attention is hard."]},{"begin":"203.920","end":"231.000","lines":["Yeah. And the way I think about it is that in situations where it\u2019s harder to get people to pay attention because they\u2019re bombarded and distracted and all these kinds of things, it\u2019s all the more important to know what the research shows about building engagement. So our ability to engage people will be enhanced by knowing what the techniques are, and those techniques become more and more important the less focused people are."]},{"begin":"231.000","end":"237.920","lines":["So share with us. What are some of the techniques? I\u2019m dying to learn some because I\u2019ve got two teenagers at home. This will help, I hope."]},{"begin":"237.920","end":"253.040","lines":["Yeah. Well, good luck. Report back to me. That\u2019s a hard audience. But yeah. So in my research and teaching, I usually emphasize a few core principles. And so one of the big ones is that, from the outset, you have to make it clear that your message is important."]},{"begin":"253.040","end":"253.880","lines":["Hmm."]},{"begin":"253.880","end":"275.520","lines":["And one of the best ways to make it clear that your message is important is by establishing that it\u2019s relevant to your audience. There\u2019s a side of relevance that\u2019s super-intuitive: that people pay more attention to things that are personally relevant to them. That\u2019s not surprising at all. But there are some handy techniques you can use to establish that."]},{"begin":"275.520","end":"301.920","lines":["So for example, you can establish relevance by communicating physical and temporal proximity. So those are sort of technical terms that I use to talk about this, but what that really means is that you\u2019re talking about things that are \u2014 they\u2019re urgent. They\u2019re immediate. They\u2019re happening here and now. So physical proximity refers to things that are around you, around your audience \u2014 so in your community, for example."]},{"begin":"301.920","end":"330.160","lines":["And temporal proximity means it\u2019s soon or now or current, that sort of thing. And so if you can let your audience know or communicate that the issue at hand, whatever it is you\u2019re talking about, is relevant because it\u2019s happening now, it\u2019s happening soon, it\u2019s happening here and nearby, those kinds of things, they\u2019ll generally pay a lot more attention to it. They\u2019ll find it to be more important to them personally, and then they\u2019ll get more engaged. So that\u2019s a big one."]},{"begin":"330.160","end":"364.680","lines":["Another big one that we could highlight here is that if you let your audience know at the outset of your message that you\u2019re going to be asking for their opinion or input, or asking them to make a decision of some sort, they\u2019ll generally pay a lot more attention to you. So if following your message you\u2019ll be asking your audience to weigh in in some way, or to make some kind of decision, or to vote, or to do anything like that, let them know up front. People pay much more attention when they know their input or perspective will be requested or invited at the end."]},{"begin":"364.680","end":"370.880","lines":["Those tips for engagement, Zakary, are really helpful. Do you have any more rapid-fire advice for getting people engaged?"]},{"begin":"370.880","end":"395.600","lines":["Yeah, sure. So off the top of my head, here are a few ideas. One thing, is use the word \u201cyou.\u201d When you address your audience as \u201cyou,\u201d using the second person, they tend to perk up and tune in a little bit. So that\u2019s one. Asking questions is another useful device. So rather than making a declarative statement at the outset of your pitch, if you ask your audience a question, that tends to increase their engagement."]},{"begin":"395.600","end":"418.120","lines":["You can also increase engagement by referencing change. So for instance, if I tell you that the guidelines around some health behavior have recently changed, that would cause you to perk up. You want to know what the information is, and you\u2019ll get more engaged and think more carefully. So those are a few off the top of my head: Say \u201cyou,\u201d ask questions, reference change. That causes a sort of spike in engagement that can be useful in persuasion."]},{"begin":"418.120","end":"438.840","lines":["Wow. Taken together that\u2019s a really great toolkit for getting people to pay attention and be engaged. I know something else that you\u2019ve done some research in is you\u2019ve looked at the role of certainty and uncertainty and how they play in persuasion. Can you tell us about this and how we can craft messages to take advantage of both certainty and uncertainty?"]},{"begin":"438.840","end":"467.200","lines":["Sure. Yeah, certainty is a big one. It\u2019s something I have spent a lot of time thinking about, and a lot of my research has focused around that. So the theme with the certainty-focused strategies is that when you know people are with you in principle, they\u2019re on board or they have the belief or attitude or opinion you want them to, try to build up their certainty. And that can be the thing that sort of transforms them from liking your idea to acting on that, buying it, recommending it, and so on."]},{"begin":"467.200","end":"471.760","lines":["So it\u2019s really about reinforcing that position they already have and strengthening it?"]},{"begin":"471.760","end":"484.240","lines":["That\u2019s right, it\u2019s \u2014 yeah. In fact, I think a lot of it is about strengthening it. So we think about certainty as a kind of attitude strength. Like a muscle can be strengthened, so can our beliefs and attitudes and opinions."]},{"begin":"484.240","end":"485.040","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"485.040","end":"506.720","lines":["And then there are specific techniques that have been shown to help boost a person\u2019s feeling of certainty. So for example, once you know somebody is on board with your position, try to help communicate to them that other people are, as well. The more consensus people perceive for their own views, the more certain they tend to feel about those views."]},{"begin":"506.720","end":"525.200","lines":["So if you ask me about my opinion towards something, and then I give it to you, and you can tell me that 89 percent of the people you\u2019ve asked have a similar opinion to mine, then I start to feel like: \u201cOh, I really got it right.\u201d That sense of being in the majority gives me a kind of social validation that makes me feel like my assessment was accurate or correct."]},{"begin":"525.200","end":"525.840","lines":["Really cool."]},{"begin":"525.840","end":"527.840","lines":["So that\u2019s one of the things you can do."]},{"begin":"527.840","end":"533.120","lines":["Excellent. And so tell us about uncertainty. How does that work?"]},{"begin":"533.120","end":"554.440","lines":["Yeah. So uncertainty is \u2014 it\u2019s actually about getting engagement. So it goes back to the \u201cengagement\u201d question, in a way. But uncertainty, the idea there is that although certainty is a good way to kind of convert an attitude into action, uncertainty is better at getting people to want more information or to think about something."]},{"begin":"554.440","end":"588.640","lines":["And so if you can create moments of uncertainty or moments of doubt or wonder in your message, that can make people feel curious. They start thinking something like: \u201cOh, I wonder what\u2019s going on here,\u201d or, \u201cWhy did he say that?\u201d or, \u201cWhat was she going to say there?\u201d People start to be curious and want more information when they have some uncertainty. And so there are ways that you can kind of trigger or induce a little bit of uncertainty as a way to sort of capitalize on that \u2014 you know, to get people pulled in and more interested in the information that you have."]},{"begin":"588.640","end":"605.480","lines":["Often when people set out to influence others, they focus on the promoting messages, all the reasons somebody should do or think something. However, there are often strong restraining or resistance forces that come to play that might prevent the adoption of whatever it is you\u2019re trying to persuade people towards."]},{"begin":"605.480","end":"622.520","lines":["I\u2019ll never forget \u2026 I study communication. My wife has got a PhD in psychology. And we could not, for the life of us, get our kids to eat their vegetables when they were younger. And the reason was not that our messages were bad \u2014 you know, \u201cYou\u2019ll grow up strong,\u201d \u201cYour friends and sports heroes do it.\u201d"]},{"begin":"622.520","end":"637.720","lines":["It\u2019s they didn\u2019t like the way they looked or tasted, and it wasn\u2019t until we changed the thing that was restraining it that we actually got them to actually enjoy eating vegetables. I know you\u2019ve done some research into ways to manage resistance. Can you share some of the best practices you\u2019ve uncovered?"]},{"begin":"637.720","end":"651.840","lines":["Yeah, sure. Well, I have done some work on resistance. And in general, there\u2019s a healthy amount of research on this topic that kind of highlights the ways you can sidestep or dampen a person\u2019s resistance if you suspect that\u2019s coming."]},{"begin":"651.840","end":"678.040","lines":["So some of the things that have been found \u2014 this isn\u2019t just by me but by other people who work on these topics \u2014 is that when you\u2019re suspecting resistance \u2026 So let\u2019s say that you have an audience or a target, and you know they tend to be resistant or they tend to be skeptical or reactant to whatever you say. They\u2019re contrarians, those kinds of folks. Taking a less forceful, more cooperative tone or using more cooperative language can be effective."]},{"begin":"678.040","end":"698.280","lines":["So using words like \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201ctogether,\u201d \u201cas a team,\u201d things like that, that sort of create a common in-group \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team here,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same group\u201d \u2014 that tends to open people up. People are generally much more open to in-group members than out-group members. And so using cooperative, nonforceful language can help with that."]},{"begin":"698.280","end":"703.280","lines":["So inclusive language makes people feel part of the same team, and that opens them up?"]},{"begin":"703.280","end":"732.520","lines":["It helps. As long as it\u2019s plausible. And so there would be cases where you try that, and people are thinking, \u201cAre you crazy? We\u2019re not in the same group,\u201d people who are so far apart or divided. But as long as it\u2019s plausible \u2014 so somebody who you do share some commonalities with or you are working toward a common goal with, that kind of thing \u2014 highlighting that and using the right kind of language can lower whatever resistance might normally spike for them. So that\u2019s one thing you can do."]},{"begin":"732.520","end":"763.320","lines":["A kind of related idea is to think about using pro-attitudinal framing. And so when you think about a person\u2019s attitude or opinion, you can usually identify whether it\u2019s positive or negative on some topic. They\u2019re favorable or unfavorable. A pro-attitudinal message is a message that\u2019s on the same side of an issue. So if someone is positive, it\u2019s also positive, not negative. Counter-attitudinal means it\u2019s on the opposite side.

I think any time you\u2019re thinking about resistance and how to combat it, you\u2019re really thinking about defensiveness. How can you make people feel less defensive, less threatened by your message, that you\u2019re not trying to say they\u2019re wrong or they\u2019re stupid or something like that?
