Glenn Carroll, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford GSB, and Michael Arena, faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania, have been looking for the answer \u2014 studying how team interactions have changed since millions of workers went remote.","In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, they discuss how teams can optimize their communications to keep innovating in a post-pandemic world."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"How we work, how we innovate, how we interact have all changed dramatically in the recent past. Today I am excited to dive into learning how innovation and our style of hybrid work interact. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am very excited to chat with Glenn Carroll and Michael Arena. Glenn is the Adams Distinguished Professor of Management at Stanford GSB. Glenn teaches leading through culture and is the co-author of Making Great Strategy: Arguing for Organizational Advantage."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Michael Arena is a faculty member in Penn\u2019s Masters and Organizational Dynamics program. Michael most recently served as the vice president of talent and development at Amazon Web Services and he authored the book Adaptive Space: How GM and Other Companies Are Positively Disrupting Themselves and Transforming into Agile Organizations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Glenn and Michael. Thanks for being here. I am looking so forward to your conversation."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"It\u2019s a pleasure to be here."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Really looking forward to the conversation, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. Let\u2019s get started. The pandemic caused a huge shift to virtual and hybrid work. You both, along with other colleagues, recently wrote a paper entitled \u201cThe Adaptive Hybrid: Innovation with Virtual Work.\u201d Michael, what research question were you setting out to address with this work?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Yeah, it\u2019s really interesting, Matt. If you would\u2019ve said pre-March 2020 that we would have all entered into this virtual experiment together and would have been as productive, if not more productive, in the virtual context, I think many managers and many of us who have studied social capital and connections would have laughed out loud."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"But it turns out that that is exactly what happened. Mostly productivity improved or at least remained the same for knowledge workers, but that led us really quickly to another question, a longer-term question which have much more to do with innovation. Like what will happen long-term from an innovation standpoint as it relates to working virtually? And we know from previous research that that requires a different set of connections than being productive."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"It turns out those particular connections are very, very fragile. So it led us down this path of really trying to understand what might be happening with innovation longer-term. And we started to really study the network patterns quite comprehensively to see what was emerging virtually during that period of time. Then we started to see some anecdotes."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Probably my favorite and most alarming was in the video game industry. Just as the video game industry was at its height, all of our children were sent home. We were all sucking up bandwidth on our home Internet systems. The kids wanted to be playing games because the educators hadn\u2019t caught up. We started to see launch delays in the video game industry."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"I think the number was there were 4X more delays in the virtual world than pre-Covid against the standard benchmark. We just started to become suspicious. Are we still generating ideas at the same velocity? And are we able to integrate new solutions and new products and scale them on the back end? That got Glenn and myself interested in really trying to dig deep into what might be happening with innovation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I certainly know that \u2013 I have two teenage sons. And they were very eager for new video game releases. Who knew video games could inspire such interesting creative research? Glenn, in order to understand the adaptive hybrid work model that you all put forth, we really first need to understand the different stages of innovation. Can you explain the different stages and give us some insight into them?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Sure. So we use a fairly standard depiction of organizational innovation that has three steps. First step is what people call ideation, which is where you brainstorm and kick around ideas and come up with what you think is a good idea. That\u2019s usually a pretty unstructured process where you put people in a room and just try to get them to interact."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"The second stage is what\u2019s often incubation. The incubation phase is when you\u2019ve decided on one, two, or three ideas, and you\u2019re trying to put them in place in an actual market or organization and see how they perform and try to fine-tune the way in which you\u2019re doing it so that it works the way you want and that the consumers understand it and react to it the way you think they should."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Then the third stage is if you\u2019ve successfully incubated an idea is to bring it to scale. Bring it to scale means to bring it to the full organization and all of its markets, products, and services that are appropriate so that you can reap the benefits of the innovation in your regular performance."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it\u2019s all about ideation, incubation, and scale. Thank you for that, Glenn. Your model also looks at bonding and bridging. Can you help us understand how these two concepts interact with the stages of innovation?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Sure. So we talk about what we call bonding ties and bridging ties, which are social connections, ties, or relationships among individuals. If you think about a group of individuals who are [fairly] closely connected to each other, meaning they have lots of different dimensions to their relationships and they interact with each other regularly and they kind of know what\u2019s going on and there\u2019s a lot of feedback and reciprocation from that, that\u2019s a bonding situation. Those are bonding ties. People feel close together, feel like a family, feel like a team."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Bridging ties, on the other hand, are ties that stretch across vast parts of your social world, in this case, organizations. So a bridging tie would be someone in manufacturing might reach out to someone in marketing or in sales or something like that who they don\u2019t normally interact with. But they\u2019re bridging across lots of different groups and lots of different parts [of an] organization in order to communicate with each other."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Bridging ties tend to be much less frequent and much less intense but are also important for innovation. What we try to describe in the paper is the way I think most social scientists would think about how these networks interface with the different stages of innovation. In the first one, the ideation phase, you\u2019re talking about bringing together people from all different parts of the organization and having them interact with each other."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"So they\u2019re actually bridging and connecting and making ideas flow from one part of the organization to another in ways that they might not normally. So the typical kind of interaction would be a water cooler conversation interaction where you\u2019re talking about the Warriors game tonight, and you happen to talk about where you\u2019re parking. And that leads to a conversation about tires, let\u2019s say. One thing leads to another. But people are connecting because they come from different worlds. They\u2019re bridging across different parts of the organization."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"The second phase of innovation, the incubation phase, is when you\u2019re very focused. You\u2019ve chosen an idea. You take your team, and you say, \u201cWe want to put this idea into place and try it out.\u201d So the team is trying to be very focused, very efficient, and to try and do what they can to make it work. So those are usually a team that works together a lot and the bonding ties there help them execute very effectively."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Then in the third phase, the scaling phase, the person or the team that\u2019s actually incubated the idea successfully tries to take it up to the larger part of the organization and usually needs help in terms of getting resources and getting people to give them access to different parts of the organization and markets that they don\u2019t normally have access to. So those again involve bridging ties, but this time rather than bridging laterally as might be the case in ideation, we\u2019re just talking to people at the same level of the organization, in the scaling phase usually are upward to people with authority who have resources and who could open up doors for you to get the thing in place."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow, so it\u2019s quite a matrix that gets created here, and the way in which relationships and networking happens matters a lot I can see based on the different phases. So, Michael, I think we have all the pieces in place now. Can you elaborate for us on this adaptive hybrid work model that you have created and suggest the best ways we can optimize innovation in a hybrid world?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Yeah, absolutely. Really just to build upon what Glenn just went through, the research that we went out and embarked upon across multiple companies suggested to us that the type of social capital in a virtual world showed up differently. In other words \u2013 and I\u2019ll go way back to the beginning of our conversation \u2013 bonding social capital actually increased immediately into the pandemic. With our closest colleagues it actually went up as much as 40 percent."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"With more distant colleagues, there\u2019s been some research out there that maybe there at least is an increase of 20 percent. But that is also the same kind of social capital you would think about not only for incubation but for productivity. So our hypothesis \u2013 and we\u2019ve got since good substantiating evidence on this \u2013 was that productivity increased because our closest connections \u2013 Zoom is really good for bringing your five to seven closest colleagues together."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"So we didn\u2019t miss a beat in the area of productivity. Turns out incubation was also positively affected during the initial stages of the pandemic. However, the opposite side of that, our bridging connections that Glenn talked about dropped off radically. Dropped off a cliff, about 30 percent in literally the first few months, which is what made us suspicious about can we continue to ideate across the organization as we\u2019ve lost these bridging connections?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Then with the video game industry, are we able to scale on the back end and synchronize these things up for formal endorsement without the appropriate bridging connections? That is essentially what the paper is about. I think a lot of [Leif Lemmings\u2019] work up at Harvard. What it takes to discover new ideas from a social network standpoint is the exact opposite of what it takes to build those ideas."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"That\u2019s the core premise of the research. We\u2019ve got to think through very fluidly what stage of work are we in as we\u2019re trying to innovate. Like are we at the beginning stage of a new idea or new innovation? Do we need bridging connections? Or are we in the middle? Are we building? Or are we trying to scale? The adaptive hybrid is basically suggesting that we need to be much more adaptive in the way we think about hybrid work."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"It\u2019s perhaps the most [foolish] advice in my opinion \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speak for Glenn, although I believe he believes this as well \u2013 is to say, \u201cCome back in the office two to three days a week.\u201d To me that\u2019s like playing social lottery. You increase your chances of connecting with people, but it\u2019s not very deliberate at all. If you\u2019re not there when you need to be there with other teams that you\u2019re dependent on, you don\u2019t really increase your odds all that significantly."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"So what we\u2019re arguing for in the paper is an adaptive hybrid that says you\u2019ve got to ask two core questions. What work stage are you in, based on those three phases of innovation? And then secondly, how much social capital and what kind of social capital do you have stored up? Our premise is based on those two questions you may choose to work virtually because you\u2019ve got stored-up social capital or you may choose to come in the office but doing it super deliberately with the other groups you need to interact with."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The advice is to look at what\u2019s going on at a meta level to understand where you\u2019re at in terms of the process and then to think about that social capital, the way in which we need to connect with people and leverage our social network at work to accomplish the goals. And in some ways that sounds like a lot of extra work, but it sounds like it\u2019s work that\u2019s very well worth it because it allows you to then make sure you\u2019re maximizing for where you are at that point in time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So besides the two questions that you posed, Michael, I\u2019m wondering are there other things that managers, leaders can be looking for to help maximize the likelihood that they\u2019re actually going to be successful innovating?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Yeah, the questions matter immensely. I also think that there\u2019s not a prescription for this. Like the easy thing to do is to want to hard-wire this and build a prescription. We\u2019ve got to experiment our way here. The other practical advice I would give to leaders is you got to use really high judgment and go run some experiments, use different interventions. Decide when you\u2019re going to come in the office and which three teams you may pull together and which intervention will work best."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"What I\u2019m seeing a lot in businesses is also play with what virtual tools might work. The most practical advice is trust your instincts and use high judgment. And then the second one is experiment, experiment, experiment. It would be easy for Glenn and I and others to come out and say, \u201cYou need this intervention. Or you need that intervention,\u201d but that may not work for your company."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"What we\u2019re really trying to challenge leaders to do is to use that high judgment and then experiment like crazy with the interventions that work most with their teams."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"A big theme I\u2019m hearing from what you and Glenn are talking about is this notion of we have to be flexible, setting rigid guidelines and boundaries might work against innovation [and in] more opportunistic types of interactions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I can\u2019t miss this opportunity to talk to Glenn and not bring up the topic of authenticity. Authenticity is a topic that we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this podcast. It plays a large role, I believe, in communication and lots of other areas. So, Glenn, I am curious to learn your thoughts about the role of authenticity in communication and how we can actively work to be more authentic."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s one of the first bits of advice most people receive when they come to their communication or somebody to help them with their communication. They say, \u201cOkay, just be your authentic self.\u201d I\u2019m just curious. What are your thoughts on that?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"So I think I have a pretty straightforward answer to your question, Matt. My answer would be that someone who\u2019s an authentic communicator when they are the same person in public speaking as they are in private, that is you don\u2019t see a change in the character or the demeanor or even the things the person says. They\u2019re really the same person."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"I think if you say someone\u2019s an authentic communicator, that\u2019s a great compliment because it says that they\u2019re really natural when they\u2019re speaking in public and they\u2019re not going to tell you something different than they would have in private."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah, interesting. So being that same person, speaking the same way \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have any data on this, Glenn, but I\u2019m just curious. When we all moved to virtual communicating or communicating in an intermediated way, I think a lot of us became inauthentic just because we had so much to pay attention. I mean we\u2019ve got all these volumes and buttons and all this."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Do you have any instinct as to the difficulty that virtual communication had on authenticity or its impact on authenticity?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"So I don\u2019t have any data, and I haven\u2019t seen any really good research on that. I mean my impression is pretty similar to yours. I think that a lot of people became what I would consider much more artificial when they\u2019re online than they were in person. On the other hand, you see the same thing when people get up and speak in person sometimes. It\u2019s not just a virtual setting where you see that, you think like, wow, that\u2019s a different person."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"I bet people say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Just something happens and I become a different person when I\u2019m speaking.\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing. Some people are probably better communicators when they\u2019re doing that. But it does make you wonder what\u2019s going on that makes a person change."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. Well, maybe there\u2019s some research and collaboration that we can do on that because I\u2019m fascinated by how the environment influences people\u2019s authenticity. Michael, I have one last question for you. You\u2019ve expressed your concern for what you term \u201ccultural erosion\u201d in organizations. What do you mean by that term? And what can be done to avoid \u2013"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"It\u2019s interesting. So the other big thing that we have been leaning into and studying is culture as it shows up in this now hybrid virtual context. One of the things that we notice is as you lose bridge connections, the organization becomes more neighborhood-like. In other words, bonding connections increase. So if you\u2019re working in close proximity to three or four teams, they\u2019re still working pretty well together."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"But the more distant teams are breaking apart from other more distant teams. We\u2019ve got some early signal that culture actually is cultivated quite well virtually inside the neighborhood. But across neighborhoods it\u2019s beginning to erode. So what we\u2019re getting is at least some early signal that we\u2019re getting more subcultures inside of an organization."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"So the erosion is less about a given behavior and more about how quickly a given behavior and/or a cultural norm can carry across the broader organization in a virtual environment. So we think that, yes, innovation matters. And certainly we\u2019re leaning into that. But we think this how behaviors travel in a hybrid world and how organizations are going to continue to reinforce their culture in this kind of an environment may actually be the even more important long-term question."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. So it might be the case that the subcultures that form, while being really effective at transmitting ideas and behaviors work well in a small group, propagating that to the larger organization might be in jeopardy."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Yeah. It\u2019s like fasten your seatbelts. Who knows how this all unfolds?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, like you said earlier, it\u2019s all about experiment, experiment, experiment, and see what happens. Before we end I\u2019d like to ask both of you the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you guys up for that?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. All right. We\u2019ll start with you, Glenn. If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"So I\u2019m going to sound like I\u2019m pandering. But this is really true, Matt. So I was watching one of your videos. You were talking about people who got nervous when they speak. Your advice was just reflect at that moment and tell yourself, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just me being nervous.\u201d In fact, if I had known that when I was much younger, I think it would\u2019ve helped me with a lot of anxiety I had in public speaking. I really is true. Once you just realize like this is a normal thing and this is still you, that it relaxes you entirely."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Pandering will get you everywhere, Glenn. No. I\u2019m glad that that advice was helpful. And it\u2019s helpful to many of us, to take a moment to just realize that anxiety is pervasive. In fact, it is the norm. To not be nervous is the stranger of the situation. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s helpful for you, and I hope it\u2019s helpful for others as well. Michael, I\u2019m curious. Who is a communicator that you admire?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"I think I\u2019m going to say Mary Barra because I had the chance of working with Mary Barra as Glenn as while I was at General Motors. She\u2019s just a really unique communicator in ways that I admire tremendously. As a leader and a little bit about what Glenn was just saying, she\u2019s super authentic. This is who Mary is. She\u2019ll have open conversations with you."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"I remember when the ignition switch issue happened. \u201cWe will never forget this.\u201d Super compelling and authentic. Awesome listener, which I think is an underrepresented part of communicating, right? Just an incredible listener who draws other people in and then is actually I think quite masterful at synthesizing what she just heard from many, many others."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"So for me like when I\u2019m thinking about leadership and communication, not standing on the stage and communicating but leadership and communicating she rises to the top to me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love that I asked a question about a communicator and you immediately went to a leader who\u2019s very good at listening and synthesizing. We often forget that that\u2019s a critical part of communication. Glenn, I\u2019d like to ask you the same question. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Yeah, so I\u2019m going to go in the other direction here. It\u2019s somebody I don\u2019t know and I really only heard speak once and that was on television. And that is Amanda Gordon. She\u2019s a young poet laureate. She read a poem at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. I mean I remember watching that. She has so much confidence, and it brought poetry to life that you rarely see these days. And I was just amazed at her. She\u2019s maybe 21 years old. I was amazed at her ability to do this. So it was a matter of her oration and not necessarily a two-way communication, but it was very, very powerful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. I was very moved by that as well. She\u2019s a very gifted communicator and was able in that moment to really bring I think a lot of people to that same conclusion you came to. Thank you. So, Michael, third question for you. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"I\u2019ll get a little unconventional on this one, too. So in social science there\u2019s something called the gossip and reputation cycle. It\u2019s basically how a message will be picked up and carried, if you want to think about it, virally across the network. For me, I think about it this way. It\u2019s got to be short. It\u2019s got to be a snippet because we communicate to others in snippets. It won\u2019t carry if it\u2019s not short."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"It\u2019s got to be compelling. Like if it\u2019s not meaningful, no one\u2019s going to repeat it, and it\u2019s not going to travel across the network. And probably most importantly is it\u2019s got to be interesting to the person you\u2019re communicating to. I\u2019m never going to repeat something that someone else says if I can\u2019t find something in it that was interesting to me or relevant to the audience is another way of thinking about that."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Those are the three things I think about is short, meaningful, and interesting to the audience or the individual that you\u2019re communicating to."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Who knew we could learn so much from gossip in terms of what makes for effective communication? But certainly being concise, making sure it\u2019s meaningful and interesting and relevant make a big difference. I certainly want to make sure that the work that you two do is not seen as gossip but is seen as very critical. And I\u2019ve really enjoyed the conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Your adaptive hybrid model I think is really informative for all businesses to think about as we navigate our way through this. And really your mantra of experiment, try, learn how to make this work for an individual organization really makes a lot of sense. I thank you very much for your time and for your insights."},{"author":"Michael Arena","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Glenn Carroll","text":"Thank you, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve been listening to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, a production of Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Thanks for being here. I am looking so forward to your conversation."]},{"begin":"75.600","end":"77.000","lines":["It\u2019s a pleasure to be here."]},{"begin":"77.000","end":"79.360","lines":["Really looking forward to the conversation, Matt."]},{"begin":"79.360","end":"98.400","lines":["Excellent. Let\u2019s get started. The pandemic caused a huge shift to virtual and hybrid work. You both, along with other colleagues, recently wrote a paper entitled \u201cThe Adaptive Hybrid: Innovation with Virtual Work.\u201d Michael, what research question were you setting out to address with this work?"]},{"begin":"98.400","end":"119.400","lines":["Yeah, it\u2019s really interesting, Matt. If you would\u2019ve said pre-March 2020 that we would have all entered into this virtual experiment together and would have been as productive, if not more productive, in the virtual context, I think many managers and many of us who have studied social capital and connections would have laughed out loud."]},{"begin":"119.400","end":"146.800","lines":["But it turns out that that is exactly what happened. Mostly productivity improved or at least remained the same for knowledge workers, but that led us really quickly to another question, a longer-term question which have much more to do with innovation. Like what will happen long-term from an innovation standpoint as it relates to working virtually? And we know from previous research that that requires a different set of connections than being productive."]},{"begin":"146.800","end":"167.920","lines":["It turns out those particular connections are very, very fragile. So it led us down this path of really trying to understand what might be happening with innovation longer-term. And we started to really study the network patterns quite comprehensively to see what was emerging virtually during that period of time. Then we started to see some anecdotes."]},{"begin":"167.920","end":"189.960","lines":["Probably my favorite and most alarming was in the video game industry. Just as the video game industry was at its height, all of our children were sent home. We were all sucking up bandwidth on our home Internet systems. The kids wanted to be playing games because the educators hadn\u2019t caught up. We started to see launch delays in the video game industry."]},{"begin":"189.960","end":"216.200","lines":["I think the number was there were 4X more delays in the virtual world than pre-Covid against the standard benchmark. We just started to become suspicious. Are we still generating ideas at the same velocity? And are we able to integrate new solutions and new products and scale them on the back end? That got Glenn and myself interested in really trying to dig deep into what might be happening with innovation."]},{"begin":"216.200","end":"240.240","lines":["I certainly know that \u2013 I have two teenage sons. And they were very eager for new video game releases. Who knew video games could inspire such interesting creative research? Glenn, in order to understand the adaptive hybrid work model that you all put forth, we really first need to understand the different stages of innovation. Can you explain the different stages and give us some insight into them?"]},{"begin":"240.240","end":"259.840","lines":["Sure. So we use a fairly standard depiction of organizational innovation that has three steps. First step is what people call ideation, which is where you brainstorm and kick around ideas and come up with what you think is a good idea. That\u2019s usually a pretty unstructured process where you put people in a room and just try to get them to interact."]},{"begin":"259.840","end":"284.240","lines":["The second stage is what\u2019s often incubation. The incubation phase is when you\u2019ve decided on one, two, or three ideas, and you\u2019re trying to put them in place in an actual market or organization and see how they perform and try to fine-tune the way in which you\u2019re doing it so that it works the way you want and that the consumers understand it and react to it the way you think they should."]},{"begin":"284.240","end":"301.080","lines":["Then the third stage is if you\u2019ve successfully incubated an idea is to bring it to scale. Bring it to scale means to bring it to the full organization and all of its markets, products, and services that are appropriate so that you can reap the benefits of the innovation in your regular performance."]},{"begin":"301.080","end":"316.520","lines":["So it\u2019s all about ideation, incubation, and scale. Thank you for that, Glenn. Your model also looks at bonding and bridging. Can you help us understand how these two concepts interact with the stages of innovation?"]},{"begin":"316.520","end":"346.520","lines":["Sure. So we talk about what we call bonding ties and bridging ties, which are social connections, ties, or relationships among individuals. If you think about a group of individuals who are [fairly] closely connected to each other, meaning they have lots of different dimensions to their relationships and they interact with each other regularly and they kind of know what\u2019s going on and there\u2019s a lot of feedback and reciprocation from that, that\u2019s a bonding situation. Those are bonding ties. People feel close together, feel like a family, feel like a team."]},{"begin":"346.520","end":"369.880","lines":["Bridging ties, on the other hand, are ties that stretch across vast parts of your social world, in this case, organizations. So a bridging tie would be someone in manufacturing might reach out to someone in marketing or in sales or something like that who they don\u2019t normally interact with. But they\u2019re bridging across lots of different groups and lots of different parts [of an] organization in order to communicate with each other."]},{"begin":"369.880","end":"395.880","lines":["Bridging ties tend to be much less frequent and much less intense but are also important for innovation. What we try to describe in the paper is the way I think most social scientists would think about how these networks interface with the different stages of innovation. In the first one, the ideation phase, you\u2019re talking about bringing together people from all different parts of the organization and having them interact with each other."]},{"begin":"395.880","end":"424.640","lines":["So they\u2019re actually bridging and connecting and making ideas flow from one part of the organization to another in ways that they might not normally. So the typical kind of interaction would be a water cooler conversation interaction where you\u2019re talking about the Warriors game tonight, and you happen to talk about where you\u2019re parking. And that leads to a conversation about tires, let\u2019s say. One thing leads to another. But people are connecting because they come from different worlds. They\u2019re bridging across different parts of the organization."]},{"begin":"424.640","end":"451.560","lines":["The second phase of innovation, the incubation phase, is when you\u2019re very focused. You\u2019ve chosen an idea. You take your team, and you say, \u201cWe want to put this idea into place and try it out.\u201d So the team is trying to be very focused, very efficient, and to try and do what they can to make it work. So those are usually a team that works together a lot and the bonding ties there help them execute very effectively."]},{"begin":"451.560","end":"487.760","lines":["Then in the third phase, the scaling phase, the person or the team that\u2019s actually incubated the idea successfully tries to take it up to the larger part of the organization and usually needs help in terms of getting resources and getting people to give them access to different parts of the organization and markets that they don\u2019t normally have access to. So those again involve bridging ties, but this time rather than bridging laterally as might be the case in ideation, we\u2019re just talking to people at the same level of the organization, in the scaling phase usually are upward to people with authority who have resources and who could open up doors for you to get the thing in place."]},{"begin":"487.760","end":"510.560","lines":["Wow, so it\u2019s quite a matrix that gets created here, and the way in which relationships and networking happens matters a lot I can see based on the different phases. So, Michael, I think we have all the pieces in place now. Can you elaborate for us on this adaptive hybrid work model that you have created and suggest the best ways we can optimize innovation in a hybrid world?"]},{"begin":"510.560","end":"536.000","lines":["Yeah, absolutely. Really just to build upon what Glenn just went through, the research that we went out and embarked upon across multiple companies suggested to us that the type of social capital in a virtual world showed up differently. In other words \u2013 and I\u2019ll go way back to the beginning of our conversation \u2013 bonding social capital actually increased immediately into the pandemic. With our closest colleagues it actually went up as much as 40 percent."]},{"begin":"536.000","end":"536.240","lines":["Wow."]},{"begin":"536.240","end":"559.120","lines":["With more distant colleagues, there\u2019s been some research out there that maybe there at least is an increase of 20 percent. But that is also the same kind of social capital you would think about not only for incubation but for productivity. So our hypothesis \u2013 and we\u2019ve got since good substantiating evidence on this \u2013 was that productivity increased because our closest connections \u2013 Zoom is really good for bringing your five to seven closest colleagues together."]},{"begin":"559.120","end":"578.200","lines":["So we didn\u2019t miss a beat in the area of productivity. Turns out incubation was also positively affected during the initial stages of the pandemic. However, the opposite side of that, our bridging connections that Glenn talked about dropped off radically. Dropped off a cliff, about 30 percent in literally the first few months, which is what made us suspicious about can we continue to ideate across the organization as we\u2019ve lost these bridging connections?"]},{"begin":"578.200","end":"597.600","lines":["Then with the video game industry, are we able to scale on the back end and synchronize these things up for formal endorsement without the appropriate bridging connections? That is essentially what the paper is about. I think a lot of [Leif Lemmings\u2019] work up at Harvard. What it takes to discover new ideas from a social network standpoint is the exact opposite of what it takes to build those ideas."]},{"begin":"597.600","end":"619.920","lines":["That\u2019s the core premise of the research. We\u2019ve got to think through very fluidly what stage of work are we in as we\u2019re trying to innovate. Like are we at the beginning stage of a new idea or new innovation? Do we need bridging connections? Or are we in the middle? Are we building? Or are we trying to scale? The adaptive hybrid is basically suggesting that we need to be much more adaptive in the way we think about hybrid work."]},{"begin":"619.920","end":"637.840","lines":["It\u2019s perhaps the most [foolish] advice in my opinion \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speak for Glenn, although I believe he believes this as well \u2013 is to say, \u201cCome back in the office two to three days a week.\u201d To me that\u2019s like playing social lottery. You increase your chances of connecting with people, but it\u2019s not very deliberate at all. If you\u2019re not there when you need to be there with other teams that you\u2019re dependent on, you don\u2019t really increase your odds all that significantly."]},{"begin":"637.840","end":"661.600","lines":["So what we\u2019re arguing for in the paper is an adaptive hybrid that says you\u2019ve got to ask two core questions. What work stage are you in, based on those three phases of innovation? And then secondly, how much social capital and what kind of social capital do you have stored up? Our premise is based on those two questions you may choose to work virtually because you\u2019ve got stored-up social capital or you may choose to come in the office but doing it super deliberately with the other groups you need to interact with."]},{"begin":"661.600","end":"683.840","lines":["The advice is to look at what\u2019s going on at a meta level to understand where you\u2019re at in terms of the process and then to think about that social capital, the way in which we need to connect with people and leverage our social network at work to accomplish the goals. And in some ways that sounds like a lot of extra work, but it sounds like it\u2019s work that\u2019s very well worth it because it allows you to then make sure you\u2019re maximizing for where you are at that point in time."]},{"begin":"683.840","end":"695.640","lines":["So besides the two questions that you posed, Michael, I\u2019m wondering are there other things that managers, leaders can be looking for to help maximize the likelihood that they\u2019re actually going to be successful innovating?"]},{"begin":"695.640","end":"717.360","lines":["Yeah, the questions matter immensely. I also think that there\u2019s not a prescription for this. Like the easy thing to do is to want to hard-wire this and build a prescription. We\u2019ve got to experiment our way here. The other practical advice I would give to leaders is you got to use really high judgment and go run some experiments, use different interventions. Decide when you\u2019re going to come in the office and which three teams you may pull together and which intervention will work best."]},{"begin":"717.360","end":"734.240","lines":["What I\u2019m seeing a lot in businesses is also play with what virtual tools might work. The most practical advice is trust your instincts and use high judgment. And then the second one is experiment, experiment, experiment. It would be easy for Glenn and I and others to come out and say, \u201cYou need this intervention. Or you need that intervention,\u201d but that may not work for your company."]},{"begin":"734.240","end":"740.000","lines":["What we\u2019re really trying to challenge leaders to do is to use that high judgment and then experiment like crazy with the interventions that work most with their teams."]},{"begin":"740.000","end":"749.200","lines":["A big theme I\u2019m hearing from what you and Glenn are talking about is this notion of we have to be flexible, setting rigid guidelines and boundaries might work against innovation [and in] more opportunistic types of interactions."]},{"begin":"749.200","end":"769.600","lines":["I can\u2019t miss this opportunity to talk to Glenn and not bring up the topic of authenticity. Authenticity is a topic that we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this podcast. It plays a large role, I believe, in communication and lots of other areas. So, Glenn, I am curious to learn your thoughts about the role of authenticity in communication and how we can actively work to be more authentic."]},{"begin":"769.600","end":"779.840","lines":["It\u2019s one of the first bits of advice most people receive when they come to their communication or somebody to help them with their communication. They say, \u201cOkay, just be your authentic self.\u201d I\u2019m just curious. What are your thoughts on that?"]},{"begin":"779.840","end":"798.160","lines":["So I think I have a pretty straightforward answer to your question, Matt. My answer would be that someone who\u2019s an authentic communicator when they are the same person in public speaking as they are in private, that is you don\u2019t see a change in the character or the demeanor or even the things the person says. They\u2019re really the same person."]},{"begin":"798.160","end":"810.560","lines":["I think if you say someone\u2019s an authentic communicator, that\u2019s a great compliment because it says that they\u2019re really natural when they\u2019re speaking in public and they\u2019re not going to tell you something different than they would have in private."]},{"begin":"810.560","end":"832.760","lines":["Yeah, interesting. So being that same person, speaking the same way \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have any data on this, Glenn, but I\u2019m just curious. When we all moved to virtual communicating or communicating in an intermediated way, I think a lot of us became inauthentic just because we had so much to pay attention. I mean we\u2019ve got all these volumes and buttons and all this."]},{"begin":"832.760","end":"839.360","lines":["Do you have any instinct as to the difficulty that virtual communication had on authenticity or its impact on authenticity?"]},{"begin":"839.360","end":"860.400","lines":["So I don\u2019t have any data, and I haven\u2019t seen any really good research on that. I mean my impression is pretty similar to yours. I think that a lot of people became what I would consider much more artificial when they\u2019re online than they were in person. On the other hand, you see the same thing when people get up and speak in person sometimes. It\u2019s not just a virtual setting where you see that, you think like, wow, that\u2019s a different person."]},{"begin":"860.400","end":"874.240","lines":["I bet people say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Just something happens and I become a different person when I\u2019m speaking.\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing. Some people are probably better communicators when they\u2019re doing that. But it does make you wonder what\u2019s going on that makes a person change."]},{"begin":"874.240","end":"889.440","lines":["Absolutely. Well, maybe there\u2019s some research and collaboration that we can do on that because I\u2019m fascinated by how the environment influences people\u2019s authenticity. Michael, I have one last question for you. You\u2019ve expressed your concern for what you term \u201ccultural erosion\u201d in organizations. What do you mean by that term? And what can be done to avoid \u2013"]},{"begin":"889.440","end":"904.080","lines":["It\u2019s interesting. So the other big thing that we have been leaning into and studying is culture as it shows up in this now hybrid virtual context. One of the things that we notice is as you lose bridge connections, the organization becomes more neighborhood-like. In other words, bonding connections increase. So if you\u2019re working in close proximity to three or four teams, they\u2019re still working pretty well together."]},{"begin":"904.080","end":"916.760","lines":["But the more distant teams are breaking apart from other more distant teams. We\u2019ve got some early signal that culture actually is cultivated quite well virtually inside the neighborhood. But across neighborhoods it\u2019s beginning to erode. So what we\u2019re getting is at least some early signal that we\u2019re getting more subcultures inside of an organization."]},{"begin":"916.760","end":"940.840","lines":["So the erosion is less about a given behavior and more about how quickly a given behavior and/or a cultural norm can carry across the broader organization in a virtual environment. So we think that, yes, innovation matters. And certainly we\u2019re leaning into that. But we think this how behaviors travel in a hybrid world and how organizations are going to continue to reinforce their culture in this kind of an environment may actually be the even more important long-term question."]},{"begin":"940.840","end":"952.560","lines":["Wow. So it might be the case that the subcultures that form, while being really effective at transmitting ideas and behaviors work well in a small group, propagating that to the larger organization might be in jeopardy."]},{"begin":"952.560","end":"956.040","lines":["Yeah. It\u2019s like fasten your seatbelts. Who knows how this all unfolds?"]},{"begin":"956.040","end":"968.200","lines":["Well, like you said earlier, it\u2019s all about experiment, experiment, experiment, and see what happens. Before we end I\u2019d like to ask both of you the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you guys up for that?"]},{"begin":"968.200","end":"968.960","lines":["Yeah."]},{"begin":"968.960","end":"981.800","lines":["Excellent. All right. We\u2019ll start with you, Glenn. If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"981.800","end":"1009.840","lines":["So I\u2019m going to sound like I\u2019m pandering. But this is really true, Matt. So I was watching one of your videos. You were talking about people who got nervous when they speak. Your advice was just reflect at that moment and tell yourself, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just me being nervous.\u201d In fact, if I had known that when I was much younger, I think it would\u2019ve helped me with a lot of anxiety I had in public speaking. I really is true. Once you just realize like this is a normal thing and this is still you, that it relaxes you entirely."]},{"begin":"1009.840","end":"1028.320","lines":["Pandering will get you everywhere, Glenn. No. I\u2019m glad that that advice was helpful. And it\u2019s helpful to many of us, to take a moment to just realize that anxiety is pervasive. In fact, it is the norm. To not be nervous is the stranger of the situation. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s helpful for you, and I hope it\u2019s helpful for others as well. Michael, I\u2019m curious. Who is a communicator that you admire?"]},{"begin":"1028.320","end":"1043.320","lines":["I think I\u2019m going to say Mary Barra because I had the chance of working with Mary Barra as Glenn as while I was at General Motors. She\u2019s just a really unique communicator in ways that I admire tremendously. As a leader and a little bit about what Glenn was just saying, she\u2019s super authentic. This is who Mary is. She\u2019ll have open conversations with you."]},{"begin":"1043.320","end":"1058.720","lines":["I remember when the ignition switch issue happened. \u201cWe will never forget this.\u201d Super compelling and authentic. Awesome listener, which I think is an underrepresented part of communicating, right? Just an incredible listener who draws other people in and then is actually I think quite masterful at synthesizing what she just heard from many, many others."]},{"begin":"1058.720","end":"1068.720","lines":["So for me like when I\u2019m thinking about leadership and communication, not standing on the stage and communicating but leadership and communicating she rises to the top to me."]},{"begin":"1068.720","end":"1082.760","lines":["I love that I asked a question about a communicator and you immediately went to a leader who\u2019s very good at listening and synthesizing. We often forget that that\u2019s a critical part of communication. Glenn, I\u2019d like to ask you the same question. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"1082.760","end":"1110.200","lines":["Yeah, so I\u2019m going to go in the other direction here. It\u2019s somebody I don\u2019t know and I really only heard speak once and that was on television. And that is Amanda Gordon. She\u2019s a young poet laureate. She read a poem at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. I mean I remember watching that. She has so much confidence, and it brought poetry to life that you rarely see these days. And I was just amazed at her. She\u2019s maybe 21 years old. I was amazed at her ability to do this. So it was a matter of her oration and not necessarily a two-way communication, but it was very, very powerful."]},{"begin":"1110.200","end":"1130.040","lines":["Absolutely. I was very moved by that as well. She\u2019s a very gifted communicator and was able in that moment to really bring I think a lot of people to that same conclusion you came to. Thank you. So, Michael, third question for you. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1130.040","end":"1151.280","lines":["I\u2019ll get a little unconventional on this one, too. So in social science there\u2019s something called the gossip and reputation cycle. It\u2019s basically how a message will be picked up and carried, if you want to think about it, virally across the network. For me, I think about it this way. It\u2019s got to be short. It\u2019s got to be a snippet because we communicate to others in snippets. It won\u2019t carry if it\u2019s not short."]},{"begin":"1151.280","end":"1172.600","lines":["It\u2019s got to be compelling. Like if it\u2019s not meaningful, no one\u2019s going to repeat it, and it\u2019s not going to travel across the network. And probably most importantly is it\u2019s got to be interesting to the person you\u2019re communicating to. I\u2019m never going to repeat something that someone else says if I can\u2019t find something in it that was interesting to me or relevant to the audience is another way of thinking about that."]},{"begin":"1172.600","end":"1181.680","lines":["Those are the three things I think about is short, meaningful, and interesting to the audience or the individual that you\u2019re communicating to."]},{"begin":"1181.680","end":"1200.720","lines":["Who knew we could learn so much from gossip in terms of what makes for effective communication? But certainly being concise, making sure it\u2019s meaningful and interesting and relevant make a big difference. I certainly want to make sure that the work that you two do is not seen as gossip but is seen as very critical. And I\u2019ve really enjoyed the conversation."]},{"begin":"1200.720","end":"1218.880","lines":["Your adaptive hybrid model I think is really informative for all businesses to think about as we navigate our way through this. And really your mantra of experiment, try, learn how to make this work for an individual organization really makes a lot of sense. I thank you very much for your time and for your insights."]},{"begin":"1218.880","end":"1220.160","lines":["Thank you."]},{"begin":"1220.160","end":"1223.520","lines":["Thank you, Matt."]},{"begin":"1223.520","end":"1257.160","lines":["You\u2019ve been listening to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, a production of Stanford Graduate School of Business.
