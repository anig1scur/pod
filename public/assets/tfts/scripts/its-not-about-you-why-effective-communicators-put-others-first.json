But in reality, the audience is the one,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they don't leave with your idea adopted, your idea is going to die.\u201d","How can presenters use empathy to put their audience at center stage? As Duarte discusses with host Matt Abrahams in this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, it's about seeking to understand before you start speaking."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The stories we tell, the presentations we deliver, and the slides we share serve to help us get our thoughts and feelings across to others. The success of these various types of communication comes from our ability to understand others\u2019 needs. Today, we\u2019ll talk about how empathy can make us better communicators. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today I am really looking forward to speaking with Nancy Duarte. Nancy is the Founder and CEO of Duarte, Inc., a world-renowned communication consulting firm. Nancy and her team have coached countless well-known companies including Apple and Salesforce. They were instrumental in helping to bring to life Al Gore\u2019s \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d which many claim is the most seen slide presentation ever. Nancy is the author of six must-read communication books, including \u201cslide:ology,\u201d \u201cResonate,\u201d \u201cIlluminate,\u201d and \u201cDataStory.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Nancy. I am super excited to talk to you."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"I\u2019m happy to be here, too, Matt. I\u2019m excited."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for being here. Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. When it comes to communication coaching, you and I are of a similar vintage. We\u2019ve both been at this for a long time. We can remember acetate slides and \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 35-millimeter projectors."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yup."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on where we are today in terms of people\u2019s expectations for communication in the channels that we use."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah, I think people don\u2019t have patience anymore for a presentation now well done. We used to be able to get away with it because all the presentations were so bad."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[Laughs]"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"But now, people don\u2019t want to spend their time if it\u2019s not bringing value. So I spoke at South by Southwest. Someone tweeted I was interesting, and 50 people walked in the room. Well, that meant 50 people walked out of other rooms. So people just don\u2019t have the patience for a presentation where it wasn\u2019t rooted in empathy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And the other thing impacting a lot is virtual or blended \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 presenting. And \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 you\u2019re talking to technology instead of having eye contact. And it really takes a lot of work and physical control, almost like you do as a golfer, right, where you physically have to control how you\u2019re showing up so that you come across as empathetic through the technology. Those are two really important things to work on."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This notion of being interesting and capturing interest and being empathetic are really important. So many different channels for our communication. And we have to learn not just to structure our messages [laughs] but we have to learn how to interact with the technology. It makes it much harder. I remember just having to print out my slides and [laughs] put them on top of the projector \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh, you\u2019re an overhead transparency guy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s exactly right. I was back in the day. I know you believe storytelling is critical to successful communication. And you did some really impressive research into what makes for a compelling story. Can you share the insights you found and any best practices we can follow so we can craft more engaging and influential presentations?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. I think at probably the root of every answer I\u2019m going to share is empathy first."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"So thinking through sometimes as a presenter, we think we\u2019re the hero, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"We\u2019re well lit. We\u2019re up on a stage. All the attention\u2019s on us. But in reality, the audience is the one \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 who if they don\u2019t leave with your idea adopted, your idea is going to die. So you have to really have an empathy-first mindset. And then there\u2019re some classic points from story that you could pick up around presenting, like most presentations don\u2019t have a clear beginning, middle, and end [laughs] \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right, right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 which is classic. My seminal work \u201cResonate\u201d was when I dove way deeply into \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 story. And in the process of researching stories, I had right beside me a book called \u201cThe Hundred Greatest Speeches of All Time.\u201d And I knew that the greatest speeches had a rhythm and a cadence and there was a pulsing in them, and I wanted to figure out why. And I figured out that it\u2019s kind of this rise and fall, this cathartic rise and fall that great storytelling has and that\u2019s \u2014 to get that you would structure your talk to kind of have this push and pull between moving people away from what currently is toward what could be. And you use that as a structural device. It turns your talk into an influential talk if you\u2019re trying to transform people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So you start from a place of it\u2019s about the audience, so it\u2019s audience centric. And then it\u2019s really structure. And those who\u2019ve listened in, I\u2019m a huge fan of structure. And what I love about the work you did of taking people from what is to what could be and it\u2019s not just once. You do it multiple times. And that\u2019s what really drives interest and, as you said leads to influence."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. It brings that pulsing and that cadence and desire. Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Can you share one or two speeches that many of us might have heard that do that well?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. So when I thought I\u2019d uncovered this structure or made this kind of discovery, I knew that it would be true if it applied to Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And in the business context, I took Steve Jobs\u2019 iPhone launch speech. Since then, I\u2019ve analyzed almost all hundred that are in the \u201cHundred Greatest Speeches of All Time.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. And what I like also beyond having that structure and using that as a guide, what\u2019s so important is we have to look back at other presentations and learn from them. And I love that you discovered what you discovered by looking back because a lot of just, especially in academic research, were always looking forward. In the business world, the stories we tell often used slides to help support and reinforce what we\u2019re saying. Your book \u201cslide:ology\u201d is seen as the definitive work on the craft, at least from my perspective. Can you share a few takeaways with us? How do you create compelling slides?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"I think to, when that was written, the presentation software apps made really fugly slides by default. I mean fugly [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes, yes."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"So by default, everything was really pretty trashy. And so what it did is it explained what good design was. And my favorite quote was from John [Meta], who said, \u201cWow, it\u2019s the first time someone\u2019s actually made the business case for design.\u201d Suddenly, when you read the book, you can kind of see why your slides are ugly and then kind of do something about it. So what it also does, it makes you step back and not think, oh, I have to lay a bunch of objects on a slide. It forces you to step back and conceptualize what might need to be said."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"So instead of like the classic handshake in front of a globe because I\u2019m going to talk about partnerships \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 it teaches you how to mine map the word partnership. And your partnership might be more like two peas in a pod, or it might be opposing savory things like salt and pepper. It might be Ginger Rogers-Fred Astaire. What is your partnership like, and what\u2019s a metaphor or a concept you can say about your partnership, that we get people closer to understanding what the partnership is, right? So this whole concept of needing to brainstorm out-of-the-box concepts so you show up unique, you show up different, you show up memorable. That\u2019s kind of bigger than just slide making. And it kind of covers that whole gamut."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"One of the key takeaways from that book is, similar to what we\u2019ve talked about before, slides are not for you as a presenter."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Slides are for the audience. And so the creative ways you\u2019re talking about, thinking about concepts like partnership. I recently was doing something on collaboration, and I was Googling for images on collaboration. And I found so many hand shakings, high-fivings. Finally, all of a sudden, I got this peanut butter and jelly, catsup and mustard. And all of a sudden, I began to think differently about collaboration. So just getting people to think about slides being for their audience and not just a teleprompter or a tool."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. And do you need slides? Like I think when we update this book, which we\u2019re working on and thinking through, like we had a multinational \u2014 leader of a multinational company come to us from India who was going to speak with the CEO of top five [brands] in the world \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 I can just say that. He was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go meet with the CEO. I need five slides.\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in the CEO\u2019s office, asking for a hundred million. Put the computer away.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And then we just rehearsed him sketching. So he jumped up to the whiteboard. He just grabbed a piece of paper. He just drew the concepts. And he walked away with the promised of a hundred million. And he had eye contact. He had empathy. The guy could see his passion. Otherwise, they would be sitting side by side, looking at a laptop and not have built the camaraderie and credibility that it takes to really convey a message."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The fact that you, who are associated with beautiful, wonderful, impactful slides, saying maybe you don\u2019t need slides is a lesson everybody needs to think about."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You run a large organization that\u2019s focused on communication. And I would imagine you and your employees have a high bar, high \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 expectations for quality and clarity and your communication internally. What are some approaches you yourself use to better communicate with your employees? And what techniques do you suggest other leaders use in their internal communication?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"I love this question because people ask me all the time, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest presentation you\u2019ve ever delivered?\u201d It\u2019s like \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 every internal one I ever have to do because like I can get paid money to travel and speak, and people are like eating out of my hand. But when I stand up and speak to my employees, they know I\u2019m going to ask them to change in some way. And also, as a presentation company, if I don\u2019t have great slides, I don\u2019t have a great narrative, and I don\u2019t nail my delivery, it\u2019s like [laughs] \u2014 oh my God, the expectations on me as the presentation lady are just off the charts. And so the call to action always usually involves \u2014 like most CEO\u2019s don\u2019t present unless there\u2019s a call to action that\u2019s asking them to change in some way. And so I have to have a great structure, great story. And one of the things that we\u2019re really good at is doing listening tours. We do listening tours, we do surveys, and we have a culture club. And so I have multiple ways to tap in to the sentiment. I can test early messages about the change that we\u2019re going to be going through. I can get really good feedback. We do an annual kickoff meeting every single year."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"We do it the week of Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday because \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream,\u201d right? So we cast the dream and the vision for the next year during that week. So we nail the talk, which is usually 90 minutes. People get excited. But then we have what we call Shop Day that follows it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Hm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Now that we\u2019re virtual, it spreads across a few days, like a few hours for a few days. And it\u2019s to immerse them in the dream. How do I immerse them so they could see it through our eyes? And we found that when we deliver the talk and then immerse them in what it\u2019s going to look like when this dream is realized it gives them fuel for the whole year to keep going, keep their head in the game. I mean, we keep doing the internal comms around it, but just that ability to declare a future and then immerse them in it really propels us really far and gets \u2014 get everyone aligned."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The thing that strikes me most about what you just said is that you spend a lot of time thinking about your internal comms."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And I think many leaders see it as a necessary evil \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh no."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 and something that they just spend \u2014 just gotta get it done \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Uh-huh."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 versus spending the thoughtful time."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And we have a monthly meeting, too. And we carve out half of one of our three-hour-long execs to just work on the messaging for those meetings because they\u2019re that \u2014 they\u2019re just that important, [unintelligible]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So taking the time, being \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 being thoughtful. I like how you focus group and listen."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tell me a little bit more about a culture club. That brings me back to my youth when \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 there was a band."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"I didn\u2019t come up with the name. They named themselves that. So I heard Indra Nooyi speak at Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s house. She used to invite all these women to her house. She said that out of all of the hundreds of thousands of Pepsi employees, there were about 40-50 of them that actually drove the culture, which was so interesting to me that they were actual drivers and ones that made the culture healthy and all of that. And that always struck me, which made me really proud of the fact that we have this committee. It\u2019s a little volunteer army of my strong employees who are the ones that kind of know laterally across the whole organization how everyone\u2019s doing. And they meet on their own. So what they do is they are the ones who design this immerse. So we say the vision, and then they immerse it. They come up with the concepts. They come up with the metaphors. They come up with the job aids, the activities. And yeah, they\u2019re the ones who love and care enough about the company that they drive that whole thing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Cool practice."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And I can see \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"It\u2019s beautiful."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 how that can really empower the employees but give you \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Uh-huh."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 insight into \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"It does."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 what you should be thinking."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s great."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"It does."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Regardless of how well thought out your presentations are \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 we often run into hesitation and resistance. How do you advise people to think about and address these audience concerns that can come up?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"The most important thing is to pull together what I call a skeptic committee."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"So you come up with people who are actual skeptics, if you have that kind of a healthy psychological safe culture, or you come up with people who can play a skeptic \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 and just come up with some of the most ridiculous things. And people actually think those. Like we think they\u2019re ridiculous. But someone actually feels that way or thinks that way."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And so we have people try to put out on the table every single way someone might resist every single way someone might be hurt, every single way someone might entrench. And then we put that into the presentation. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to present some data, but it\u2019s kind of controversial. You have to say, I chose this dataset because X, Y, Z, M, L, N, O, P. I rejected this dataset because X, Y, Z, you know. And we need to be really honest and forthright about what we have chosen to reject and why. So it\u2019s not all about pushing people towards something. You also have to get people to let go of some things \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 and let them \u2014 let go of this dataset or let go of this old norm that used to be in our culture, or let go of this customer, like whatever those things are. Sometimes moving forward is a lot about letting go."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s a really powerful thought that a lot of us focus on pushing, pushing, pushing \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 in the direction we want to go. And yet sometimes we would be better served to focus on the things holding us where we are."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"And sever those things. So that\u2019s what \u201cIlluminate\u201d was a lot about. A lot of people forgot how hard it was for Steve Jobs to move people from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS 10. And literally, he was getting frustrated with the developer community. He literally had a coffin onstage with stained glass, played eerie music, and held a funeral for Mac OS 9 [laughs], right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Nancy Duarte: It\u2019s like let it go. It is \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 gone. Move on. And so there\u2019s powerful things and ways you can communicate outside of a presentation \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 like a ceremony. And that really worked."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And the fact that you pull skeptics together and encourage \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 people is helpful."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This notion of opening up the insight through your culture committee through bringing skeptics together I think could be really helpful. I hear that you\u2019re expanding your offerings to include trainings on listening. Can you talk more about the importance of listening in communication and highlight one or two key listening techniques we should all work on?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"We contend that building on active listening \u2014 this [is an] instead of that, yeah, make it really clear you\u2019re listening and all of the active listening tools, that building on that is how you respond is part of listening. And even part of active listening says to withhold judgment. But what if the person talking to you wants you to judge their idea? Like what if that\u2019s the very thing they\u2019re seeking? So two gals on my team, [Megan] and [Nicole], did a couple of years of research, pretty deep research \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 and have built an assessment where you could figure out what your default listening style is. So you have one of four default listening styles. We define empathy \u2014 oh look, empathy came up again \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah [laughs], yeah."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"\u2014 we define empathy as know yourself, understand others, and adapt yourself. So it\u2019s a little bit more I can\u2019t walk in your shoes if I don\u2019t know what shoes I wear, [laughs] you know myself so that I can step into yours."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And by the way, you have some really cool shoes on. Thank you."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh yeah. I\u2019ve got \u2014 my grandkids picked these out for me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[You\u2019ve got] great \u2014."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"So by understanding how you show up as a default, as a listener, and then I can assess you, can understand you and how you want me to listen, I need to adapt. So my default is to advance. Like I listen to advance. And a close second of mine is discern. Well, I do that because I\u2019m a CEO. People are coming to me with questions all the time \u2014 discern-advance, discern-advance, advance-discern. And that\u2019s just my modality all the time."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"But there\u2019s a lot of times my exec team doesn\u2019t need that from me. One time I was away for like ten days on vacation, off the grid \u2014 which is really rare \u2014 came back; they were updating me. And they didn\u2019t want me to jump in and say this-this-this. They wanted me to be \u2014 support them and say good job. They didn\u2019t need me to do my default. So the acronym is SAID, S-A-I-D \u2014 Support, Advance, Immerse, or Discern. And those are the four types. And then you may want me to show up and immerse and not discern. So I need to understand the situation \u2014 look at you through a new lens. And then how I respond to you makes you feel like I listened, or it makes you feel I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s changed me as a leader. It\u2019s changed me as a mother. It changed my relationship with my children. It\u2019s been really good for me, so \u2014."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, it sounds like it would be good for all of us, just \u2014"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"It would be."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 taking the time to understand how we listen and how we need to adapt to connect with other people."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. And [unintelligible] \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s [only] research based."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"It grows sales. It helps employee engagement. All the things that people are hurting right now, like really hurting on, it holds the key. So it\u2019s exciting."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The more and more I do the work I do, the more and more I do this podcast, the more and more listening becomes a critical element. I\u2019m really curious to getting your answers on the three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah [laughs]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would that be?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"[Laughs] So it doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily have a mastery of this title, but I would say it is seek first to understand, and then speak."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Seek first to understand, and then speak. So that\u2019s all about empathy. But the seeking part seems to me to be even more active than just say be empathetic, but seek to understand."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Like I think I\u2019m working on staying curious and staying really curious and not showing up thinking I know. And so that\u2019s why it\u2019s seeking to understand."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s really powerful. And I agree, it\u2019s much more active. And the fact that you have to be curious first. Question number two, and this I\u2019m going to be really fascinated because you have worked with just some amazing communicators."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"[Laughs] Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Who is a communicator that you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"My favorite communicator on the planet is Scott Harrison. He is the CEO of charity: water. And he started this nonprofit years ago. He\u2019s like a clubster in New York, has an existential moment when he was on the Mercy Ship seeing small children drink filthy water. What he does, his use of story and how he communicates and how he reveals information over time is unprecedented. He just weaves it. So he\u2019s got the master structure and can weave story in so elegantly. And he tells personal stories. Like one of my favorite moments was when he had been doing it for ten years, and he was even getting numb. You know, you can go to TED and these conferences. And eventually, it\u2019s like you just have to get to a place where it rolls off your back. So he had kind of lost his own like fire \u2014 he felt his own fire \u2014. So he went out and sought out a story. He traveled back to Africa because he\u2019d always heard this rumor of a story that was really tragic about this gal seeking out water. And he went and found that story and re kind of gulped that story in again. And it gave him the emotional energy to keep going."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sounds like wonderful work he\u2019s doing and wonderful storytelling."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Yeah. Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And he\u2019s keeping himself immersed in it. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Well, you probably would guess, the first one\u2019s empathy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"[Laughs] And incorporate story. Story framework, story structure, and stories into it, like plant little stories throughout. And then also your delivery. So how you come across, it either diminishes your credibility or amplifies your credibility. And so just make sure that you\u2019re coming across the way the audience wants it. Now when I say delivery, I don\u2019t just mean stand and deliver and eye contact. And maybe the best thing you could have done is send a slide doc, a presentation to read ahead, and they don\u2019t even need to meet. Like delivery is expansive. It could be a video. It [could be send] a video. So it\u2019s delivery also kind of means the medium and not just your body language and stuff like that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm. So empathy and listening, story and structure, and delivery and really thinking about the medium of the message. Very, very helpful. Well, Nancy, this whole thing was helpful. And I really appreciate you taking time and sharing with us how we can all be more empathetic, curious, and powerful communicators. Thank you."},{"author":"Nancy Duarte","text":"Oh, it was fun to be here, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would that be?"]},{"begin":"1061.760","end":"1071.560","lines":["[Laughs] So it doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily have a mastery of this title, but I would say it is seek first to understand, and then speak."]},{"begin":"1071.560","end":"1081.960","lines":["Seek first to understand, and then speak. So that\u2019s all about empathy. But the seeking part seems to me to be even more active than just say be empathetic, but seek to understand."]},{"begin":"1081.960","end":"1091.800","lines":["Like I think I\u2019m working on staying curious and staying really curious and not showing up thinking I know. And so that\u2019s why it\u2019s seeking to understand."]},{"begin":"1091.800","end":"1104.640","lines":["That\u2019s really powerful. And I agree, it\u2019s much more active. And the fact that you have to be curious first. Question number two, and this I\u2019m going to be really fascinated because you have worked with just some amazing communicators."]},{"begin":"1104.640","end":"1105.200","lines":["[Laughs] Yeah."]},{"begin":"1105.200","end":"1107.680","lines":["Who is a communicator that you admire, and why?"]},{"begin":"1107.680","end":"1171.640","lines":["My favorite communicator on the planet is Scott Harrison. He is the CEO of charity: water. And he started this nonprofit years ago. He\u2019s like a clubster in New York, has an existential moment when he was on the Mercy Ship seeing small children drink filthy water. What he does, his use of story and how he communicates and how he reveals information over time is unprecedented. He just weaves it. So he\u2019s got the master structure and can weave story in so elegantly. And he tells personal stories. Like one of my favorite moments was when he had been doing it for ten years, and he was even getting numb. You know, you can go to TED and these conferences. And eventually, it\u2019s like you just have to get to a place where it rolls off your back. So he had kind of lost his own like fire \u2014 he felt his own fire \u2014. So he went out and sought out a story. He traveled back to Africa because he\u2019d always heard this rumor of a story that was really tragic about this gal seeking out water. And he went and found that story and re kind of gulped that story in again. And it gave him the emotional energy to keep going."]},{"begin":"1171.640","end":"1175.000","lines":["Sounds like wonderful work he\u2019s doing and wonderful storytelling."]},{"begin":"1175.000","end":"1175.680","lines":["Yeah. Yeah."]},{"begin":"1175.680","end":"1184.120","lines":["And he\u2019s keeping himself immersed in it. What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1184.120","end":"1187.560","lines":["Well, you probably would guess, the first one\u2019s empathy."]},{"begin":"1187.560","end":"1188.280","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"1188.280","end":"1228.160","lines":["[Laughs] And incorporate story. Story framework, story structure, and stories into it, like plant little stories throughout. And then also your delivery. So how you come across, it either diminishes your credibility or amplifies your credibility. And so just make sure that you\u2019re coming across the way the audience wants it. Now when I say delivery, I don\u2019t just mean stand and deliver and eye contact. And maybe the best thing you could have done is send a slide doc, a presentation to read ahead, and they don\u2019t even need to meet. Like delivery is expansive. It could be a video. It [could be send] a video. So it\u2019s delivery also kind of means the medium and not just your body language and stuff like that."]},{"begin":"1228.160","end":"1247.760","lines":["Mm. So empathy and listening, story and structure, and delivery and really thinking about the medium of the message. Very, very helpful. Well, Nancy, this whole thing was helpful. And I really appreciate you taking time and sharing with us how we can all be more empathetic, curious, and powerful communicators. Thank you."]},{"begin":"1247.760","end":"1249.760","lines":["Oh, it was fun to be here, Matt."]},{"begin":"1249.760","end":"1277.240","lines":["Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, from Stanford Graduate School of Business.
