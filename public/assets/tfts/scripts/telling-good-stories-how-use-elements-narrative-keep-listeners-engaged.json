Create compelling situations, full of suspense and surprise, she says. Create characters we can empathize with; speak your written sentences aloud, and, Moya advises, think of the images your words may conjure, and how they may be interpreted by different audiences."],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We all know that a good story can move us, make us feel something, teach us something, help us be better at something. But can a story literally move us, that is get us to move and be healthy? Today, we\u2019ll learn the answer to this question and many other best practices for what makes a good story. I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We are so lucky today to be joined by Paula Moya. Paula is the Danily and Laura Louise Bell professor of the humanities and a professor of English at Stanford. She also is a recipient of the Dean\u2019s Award for distinguished teaching. Paula has several books on the market, the most recent being the social imperative, race, close reading and contemporary literary criticism."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"For the past two years, she\u2019s been part of a research project that investigates and validates using narrative to encourage individuals to increase their activity levels to improve health span. Welcome, Paula. I am so eager to work with you."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Thank you, Matt. I\u2019m so glad to be here and to have an opportunity to chat with you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great. Let\u2019s get started. Before we get into some of the really cool ways you\u2019re using stories to motivate people, I\u2019d like to start with some general questions about stories. You are a narratologist. I\u2019d never heard that term before. Can you define what that means? And what do you do?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"[laughs] Well, narratology basically is just the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these things affect human perception. So a narratologist basically is just someone who does the studying. You know, I\u2019ve always loved reading. And I\u2019m captivated by stories. So it\u2019s been my pleasure over the last decade or so to be able to spend time thinking about what makes narratives work."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow, a whole field I was unaware of. So as somebody who studied narratives as deeply as you have, I\u2019m curious. From your perspective, what makes a good narrative or story?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"I guess I\u2019d have to say that a lot depends on what anyone means by good. Right. So [laughs] I love many different kinds of stories. And I know that they all draw on different kinds of elements to give them their value. But the basic elements of a story \u2014 we can start there \u2014 of a story or a narrative or plot \u2014 so like what happens \u2014 characters, points of view, or perspective \u2014 and that relates to focalization; setting, like where it\u2019s located; scene, kind of basically what they\u2019re talking about; and of course, style."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"So conflict is also central to any story because there always needs to be something that kind of gets the story going and powers the events that occur. So these elements will always be present in any particular story, albeit in different combinations and with different emphases."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"So you know, a good story or narrative will have all of those. But it\u2019s important to note, from my perspective, that what one person defines as good may be very different from what some other person defines as good. So what good is will be very much influenced by what someone knows, what they value, what they love and also what they recognize."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"And this is sometimes cultural, right, based on where someone grew up, what they are accustomed to doing in their daily lives. And it\u2019s also sometimes learned, right, based on what we\u2019re taught in school. Right. What did our teachers tell us or even what someone we admire says is good so maybe a preacher or a mother or an aunt. So for example, those of us who read a lot of stories or consume a lot of narratives \u2014 and so I count myself among one of those \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"\u2014 because I\u2019m always reading or watching some serial or something. You know, when we do that, we can easily become bored by characters that we perceive as stock characters or plots that are predictable. You know, if you read enough narratives, you start to recognize certain particular terms."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"And we get bored by them because we\u2019ve seen them too many times before. And they contain for us no surprises. At the same time, for someone else, that same story can be fresh and interesting. So my answer kind of to like what\u2019s good \u2014 what makes a good narrative is that a story is good if someone somewhere values it as good. Now, it just might not be good for me. [laughs] And I\u2019m making a larger point about the existence of multiple conceptions of the good."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Certainly. I hear you talking about several things. For example, you need to think about who your story is for and what\u2019s going to be interesting \u2014"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 relevant and exciting for them."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And you need to be careful, I heard, also of falling into the trap of using common clich\u00e9s or common ways of telling the story or designing the story. I heard you talk about surprise. I heard you talk about a novelty \u2014 or at least I\u2019m applying novelty to what you said \u2014 to really make it something \u2014"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 that stands out. Would you agree with those?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"I would completely agree with that. So it\u2019s kind of a mix of making it familiar, which we like \u2014 just as human beings psychologically, we have a kind of principle familiarity that drives us \u2014 and also making it new, making it a little surprising, giving us something that is not predictable."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"But this kind of goes back to the first thing that you picked up on which is that we always have to think about who this narrative is for because it\u2019s going to be \u2014 you know, what\u2019s going to work is going to be different according to who it\u2019s for."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. And that is a theme we have heard many times on this podcast about really reflecting on our audience for our communication. Should we approach crafting stories meant to be read differently from those that we speak?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Absolutely. I really agree with that because \u2014 you know it is. If you\u2019re listening to a story, you might need a heavier dose of repetition to help your listener keep track of what is happening. So you see this in sort of storytelling cultures where there\u2019s often a great deal of repetition. And they come back to certain kinds of motifs such as a certain image or a certain color."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"And you know, if you\u2019re listening to a story, you can\u2019t go back and look something up. Right. You need the storyteller to help you by drawing you along with these repeated motifs, these repeated words and also reminders of who is who and how they are related to other characters. And I think it\u2019s probably a little easier to have a more complex narrative in writing than listening."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm. I really want to emphasize this point. In the work that I do, there\u2019s a really big challenge that people have. They write as if they\u2019re writing their content to be read. And then, they speak it. And it just sounds different. It doesn\u2019t connect in the same way."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"[laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abraham","text":"s: A lot of the ideas that you suggested \u2014 those are all things that can really help a story stand out when spoken and, similarly, might seem redundant or repetitive or short-sighted in a written piece. So the big message is we have to envision writing for speaking and writing for being read as very different things. And I think that point is super important."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"It absolutely is. And I\u2019m glad that you are articulating it so clearly. I need to learn from you, Matt. [laughter]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No. Well, I do a lot of speaking. So I repeat myself a lot, much to my family\u2019s dismay."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"But let me just say one more thing about that is that always, when we\u2019re thinking about communicating, we need to think about the medium. Like so how is it that we are \u2014 what is the medium through which we are communicating? So obviously, a novel is a different medium than, say, you know, a story circle where you\u2019re sitting around talking to people. The medium, really that is \u2014 makes it so important to sort of shift how you do something if you want to communicate well."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So true. I cannot tell you the number of times I see people try to tell stories through bullet points on PowerPoint slides. And it\u2019s the wrong medium. It\u2019s the wrong tool to get your message across. And I really appreciate that advice. I\u2019d like to turn to your research. Your research and writings focus on race and culture. Do you have any guidance on how we can be more inclusive of diversity and the stories we choose to tell and how we actually craft those stories?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Well, I think probably the easiest way, the most simple way to be inclusive of diversity is also the most obvious way. That is to write or consume stories about those people, places, events and dilemmas that are, for the most part, absent or underrepresented in the mainstream of society. So there are not, for example, sufficient representations of Latinx people in the media, television, theater, the movies and journalism, to give a true and accurate picture of the richness and the complexity of Latino life."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"This is not to say that there is none, just to say that there is a dearth of such representation relative to the number of Latinx people living in this country. And unfortunately, many of the representations of Latinx people are quite negative and stereotypical and so not representative of the wide range of experiences of people who are associated with that ethnicity."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it certainly sounds to me like, if you\u2019re looking to be more inclusive in the stories you tell, you need to tell stories that include people. That, by definition, I think, is what we\u2019re talking about. But we also have to be sensitive to what we represent and what we tell those stories about."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So it\u2019s not just including people in the stories. It\u2019s what those stories are about and the focus and what they \u2014 the message they send beyond the story itself. And that\u2019s really important for all of us to think about. As we live in a more diverse culture, it\u2019s critical to hear the stories and voices of everyone. You were part of a very cool interdisciplinary team looking at the role of narrative in motivating positive health behavior. Can you tell us briefly about The Perfecto Project?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"So The Perfecto Project is actually an extension of a larger project involving a very large interdisciplinary team at Stanford University that has been researching the effectiveness in motivating mobility of narrative-based feedback that is delivered on the ambient screen of an android smartphone."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"So basically, that just means it\u2019s a mobility app that helps take the user through a narrative. And as the user exercises or walks or does some kind of physical activity, the story moves along. So they help [tower] the story in that sense."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It sounds to me like it\u2019s a fitness tracker, the data from which actually moves you through a story. And that story serves to help motivate even more movement. Is that right?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"That\u2019s exactly right. So what we\u2019re trying to do is create a narrative that\u2019s interesting enough that the person wants to do their exercise, so they can get the next chapter."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. I think, for the listeners, this notion of thinking about creating stories that you share as a leader, as a participant of teams that are culturally relevant and the fact that you are finding that the notion that a story can serve as motivation for any behavior potentially is really a fascinating one."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As part of the work you just described, I read that there seems to be a link between motivation and empathy for characters and stories. Can you describe this association and any guidance that it might suggest for those of us trying to motivate others through the stories we tell?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Well, I do think empathy where we feel for others as well things like recognition where we maybe see characters that remind us of ourselves are very important for how stories affect listeners and readers because one very basic psychological phenomenon is familiarity, which is simply a form of remembering and with a situation and event, a person, a place or the like provokes a subjective feeling of recognition."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"So it\u2019s like, yes, you know, I\u2019ve been at that tamale-making party. I\u2019ve been at that birthday party where we break a pi\u00f1ata. So it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. But it brings something of ourselves to us. And I think being recognized makes us feel good, feel valued. It makes us feel a sense of belonging."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"This notion of helping people feel what you\u2019re talking about is familiar to them is really interesting. It really speaks to the need to demonstrate that you understand people\u2019s experience and help them see how they can change that experience, enhance that experience, etcetera."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So this notion of using empathy to demonstrate familiarity, I think, is a really interesting tool for those of us who craft communications to have in our toolkit. Do you have a favorite tool that you listen for or look for in what you write or you read? For example, I do. I love alliteration. I\u2019m curious. Do you have any tools you find that you gravitate towards in narratives that you write or listen to?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"You know, that\u2019s a very interesting question. I\u2019m not sure that I think of it as programmatically that, like these are my tools. But I definitely use alliteration. I find it very effective. So a modicum of repetition, alliteration \u2014 I will often speak my written sentences aloud to see how they sound to me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"And then, of course, thinking about images \u2014 I\u2019m very attentive to the use of certain words and also not reinforcing certain associations that have been negative, for instance, for people of color."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The tools you shared are really helpful for all of us to think about. Before we get to our closing, I am curious if you have any last best practices on how to craft better stories to motivate our audiences."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Clearly, an author or a storyteller needs to create compelling situations and dilemmas full of suspense and surprise because those are things that give us joy. They also need to create characters in whom we are interested, whether it be because the characters \u2014 we see ourselves in them or because we care about them or feel empathy for them or because they operate in a field of action that in some way intrigues us, maybe even scares us."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody. Sound okay?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Yeah. Sure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five-to-seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Make them want to turn the page."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like that. So it\u2019s building intrigue."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Now, granted that \u2014 it is an eight-word sentence, I think. But you know, I\u2019m not sure who I got this from. It might have been like Margaret Atwood. But you know, if you\u2019re reading a novel, like you want to know either because the character or the situation or whatever, you want to know what\u2019s going to happen."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. It\u2019s building suspense and intrigue. And that\u2019s important in all communication. Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire? And why?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"I would say that Margaret Atwood is an amazing communicator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"She is an amazing novelist. I eagerly seek out anything she writes. She is a beautiful user of language. She could make me envision the world that she was putting together. And she also was not afraid to make difficult characters who are real in the sense that people like them exist out there in the world."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Our final question \u2014 what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"I\u2019d say sense \u2014 like the story has to make sense \u2014 humor and then finally suspense. And that comes from like making them want to turn the page."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I like this notion of it just has to make sense. Right. A lot of us take a simple criterion like that \u2014 we\u2019ve definitely on this podcast talked about humor and the value of humor. You\u2019ve illuminated today how suspense and familiarity can be really, really helpful. Paula, thank you so much for joining us today and sharing the story of your work and how to make our stories work better."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We\u2019re taking away so many important insights that can really strengthen our narratives and help us motivate people in the direction that we want. I appreciate your time and your insights. Thank you."},{"author":"Paula Moya","text":"Well, thank you, Matt. I\u2019m very happy to have had the chance to talk with you.

Before we get into some of the really cool ways you\u2019re using stories to motivate people, I\u2019d like to start with some general questions about stories. You are a narratologist. I\u2019d never heard that term before. Can you define what that means? And what do you do?"]},{"begin":"100.360","end":"128.680","lines":["[laughs] Well, narratology basically is just the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these things affect human perception. So a narratologist basically is just someone who does the studying. You know, I\u2019ve always loved reading. And I\u2019m captivated by stories. So it\u2019s been my pleasure over the last decade or so to be able to spend time thinking about what makes narratives work."]},{"begin":"128.680","end":"140.760","lines":["Wow, a whole field I was unaware of. So as somebody who studied narratives as deeply as you have, I\u2019m curious. From your perspective, what makes a good narrative or story?"]},{"begin":"140.760","end":"175.760","lines":["I guess I\u2019d have to say that a lot depends on what anyone means by good. Right. So [laughs] I love many different kinds of stories. And I know that they all draw on different kinds of elements to give them their value. But the basic elements of a story \u2014 we can start there \u2014 of a story or a narrative or plot \u2014 so like what happens \u2014 characters, points of view, or perspective \u2014 and that relates to focalization; setting, like where it\u2019s located; scene, kind of basically what they\u2019re talking about; and of course, style."]},{"begin":"175.760","end":"193.680","lines":["So conflict is also central to any story because there always needs to be something that kind of gets the story going and powers the events that occur.

But it\u2019s important to note, from my perspective, that what one person defines as good may be very different from what some other person defines as good. So what good is will be very much influenced by what someone knows, what they value, what they love and also what they recognize."]},{"begin":"217.840","end":"248.960","lines":["And this is sometimes cultural, right, based on where someone grew up, what they are accustomed to doing in their daily lives. And it\u2019s also sometimes learned, right, based on what we\u2019re taught in school. Right. What did our teachers tell us or even what someone we admire says is good so maybe a preacher or a mother or an aunt.

And they contain for us no surprises. At the same time, for someone else, that same story can be fresh and interesting. So my answer kind of to like what\u2019s good \u2014 what makes a good narrative is that a story is good if someone somewhere values it as good. Now, it just might not be good for me.

I really agree with that because \u2014 you know it is. If you\u2019re listening to a story, you might need a heavier dose of repetition to help your listener keep track of what is happening.

Right. You need the storyteller to help you by drawing you along with these repeated motifs, these repeated words and also reminders of who is who and how they are related to other characters. And I think it\u2019s probably a little easier to have a more complex narrative in writing than listening."]},{"begin":"428.240","end":"446.920","lines":["Mm-hmm. I really want to emphasize this point. In the work that I do, there\u2019s a really big challenge that people have. They write as if they\u2019re writing their content to be read.

It doesn\u2019t connect in the same way."]},{"begin":"446.920","end":"447.080","lines":["[laughs]"]},{"begin":"447.080","end":"474.240","lines":["s: A lot of the ideas that you suggested \u2014 those are all things that can really help a story stand out when spoken and, similarly, might seem redundant or repetitive or short-sighted in a written piece.

And I think that point is super important."]},{"begin":"474.240","end":"480.600","lines":["It absolutely is. And I\u2019m glad that you are articulating it so clearly. I need to learn from you, Matt. [laughter]"]},{"begin":"480.600","end":"487.440","lines":["No. Well, I do a lot of speaking. So I repeat myself a lot, much to my family\u2019s dismay."]},{"begin":"487.440","end":"515.680","lines":["But let me just say one more thing about that is that always, when we\u2019re thinking about communicating, we need to think about the medium. Like so how is it that we are \u2014 what is the medium through which we are communicating? So obviously, a novel is a different medium than, say, you know, a story circle where you\u2019re sitting around talking to people. The medium, really that is \u2014 makes it so important to sort of shift how you do something if you want to communicate well."]},{"begin":"515.680","end":"545.880","lines":["So true. I cannot tell you the number of times I see people try to tell stories through bullet points on PowerPoint slides. And it\u2019s the wrong medium. It\u2019s the wrong tool to get your message across. And I really appreciate that advice. I\u2019d like to turn to your research. Your research and writings focus on race and culture. Do you have any guidance on how we can be more inclusive of diversity and the stories we choose to tell and how we actually craft those stories?"]},{"begin":"545.880","end":"582.120","lines":["Well, I think probably the easiest way, the most simple way to be inclusive of diversity is also the most obvious way. That is to write or consume stories about those people, places, events and dilemmas that are, for the most part, absent or underrepresented in the mainstream of society. So there are not, for example, sufficient representations of Latinx people in the media, television, theater, the movies and journalism, to give a true and accurate picture of the richness and the complexity of Latino life."]},{"begin":"582.120","end":"606.120","lines":["This is not to say that there is none, just to say that there is a dearth of such representation relative to the number of Latinx people living in this country. And unfortunately, many of the representations of Latinx people are quite negative and stereotypical and so not representative of the wide range of experiences of people who are associated with that ethnicity."]},{"begin":"606.120","end":"623.320","lines":["So it certainly sounds to me like, if you\u2019re looking to be more inclusive in the stories you tell, you need to tell stories that include people. That, by definition, I think, is what we\u2019re talking about. But we also have to be sensitive to what we represent and what we tell those stories about."]},{"begin":"623.320","end":"654.560","lines":["So it\u2019s not just including people in the stories. It\u2019s what those stories are about and the focus and what they \u2014 the message they send beyond the story itself. And that\u2019s really important for all of us to think about. As we live in a more diverse culture, it\u2019s critical to hear the stories and voices of everyone. You were part of a very cool interdisciplinary team looking at the role of narrative in motivating positive health behavior. Can you tell us briefly about The Perfecto Project?"]},{"begin":"654.560","end":"675.560","lines":["So The Perfecto Project is actually an extension of a larger project involving a very large interdisciplinary team at Stanford University that has been researching the effectiveness in motivating mobility of narrative-based feedback that is delivered on the ambient screen of an android smartphone."]},{"begin":"675.560","end":"693.760","lines":["So basically, that just means it\u2019s a mobility app that helps take the user through a narrative. And as the user exercises or walks or does some kind of physical activity, the story moves along. So they help [tower] the story in that sense."]},{"begin":"693.760","end":"704.640","lines":["It sounds to me like it\u2019s a fitness tracker, the data from which actually moves you through a story. And that story serves to help motivate even more movement. Is that right?"]},{"begin":"704.640","end":"713.400","lines":["That\u2019s exactly right. So what we\u2019re trying to do is create a narrative that\u2019s interesting enough that the person wants to do their exercise, so they can get the next chapter."]},{"begin":"713.400","end":"737.240","lines":["Wow. I think, for the listeners, this notion of thinking about creating stories that you share as a leader, as a participant of teams that are culturally relevant and the fact that you are finding that the notion that a story can serve as motivation for any behavior potentially is really a fascinating one."]},{"begin":"737.240","end":"756.400","lines":["As part of the work you just described, I read that there seems to be a link between motivation and empathy for characters and stories. Can you describe this association and any guidance that it might suggest for those of us trying to motivate others through the stories we tell?"]},{"begin":"756.400","end":"784.640","lines":["Well, I do think empathy where we feel for others as well things like recognition where we maybe see characters that remind us of ourselves are very important for how stories affect listeners and readers because one very basic psychological phenomenon is familiarity, which is simply a form of remembering and with a situation and event, a person, a place or the like provokes a subjective feeling of recognition."]},{"begin":"784.640","end":"807.520","lines":["So it\u2019s like, yes, you know, I\u2019ve been at that tamale-making party. I\u2019ve been at that birthday party where we break a pi\u00f1ata. So it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. But it brings something of ourselves to us. And I think being recognized makes us feel good, feel valued. It makes us feel a sense of belonging."]},{"begin":"807.520","end":"831.280","lines":["This notion of helping people feel what you\u2019re talking about is familiar to them is really interesting. It really speaks to the need to demonstrate that you understand people\u2019s experience and help them see how they can change that experience, enhance that experience, etcetera."]},{"begin":"831.280","end":"859.080","lines":["So this notion of using empathy to demonstrate familiarity, I think, is a really interesting tool for those of us who craft communications to have in our toolkit. Do you have a favorite tool that you listen for or look for in what you write or you read? For example, I do. I love alliteration. I\u2019m curious. Do you have any tools you find that you gravitate towards in narratives that you write or listen to?"]},{"begin":"859.080","end":"883.600","lines":["You know, that\u2019s a very interesting question. I\u2019m not sure that I think of it as programmatically that, like these are my tools. But I definitely use alliteration. I find it very effective. So a modicum of repetition, alliteration \u2014 I will often speak my written sentences aloud to see how they sound to me."]},{"begin":"883.600","end":"884.800","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"884.800","end":"899.280","lines":["And then, of course, thinking about images \u2014 I\u2019m very attentive to the use of certain words and also not reinforcing certain associations that have been negative, for instance, for people of color."]},{"begin":"899.280","end":"912.960","lines":["The tools you shared are really helpful for all of us to think about. Before we get to our closing, I am curious if you have any last best practices on how to craft better stories to motivate our audiences."]},{"begin":"912.960","end":"943.320","lines":["Clearly, an author or a storyteller needs to create compelling situations and dilemmas full of suspense and surprise because those are things that give us joy. They also need to create characters in whom we are interested, whether it be because the characters \u2014 we see ourselves in them or because we care about them or feel empathy for them or because they operate in a field of action that in some way intrigues us, maybe even scares us."]},{"begin":"943.320","end":"949.080","lines":["Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody. Sound okay?"]},{"begin":"949.080","end":"950.480","lines":["Yeah. Sure."]},{"begin":"950.480","end":"959.960","lines":["All right. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five-to-seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"959.960","end":"961.920","lines":["Make them want to turn the page."]},{"begin":"961.920","end":"963.960","lines":["I really like that. So it\u2019s building intrigue."]},{"begin":"963.960","end":"974.600","lines":["Now, granted that \u2014 it is an eight-word sentence, I think. But you know, I\u2019m not sure who I got this from. It might have been like Margaret Atwood. But you know, if you\u2019re reading a novel, like you want to know either because the character or the situation or whatever, you want to know what\u2019s going to happen."]},{"begin":"974.600","end":"986.080","lines":["Absolutely. It\u2019s building suspense and intrigue. And that\u2019s important in all communication. Let me ask you question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire? And why?"]},{"begin":"986.080","end":"991.040","lines":["I would say that Margaret Atwood is an amazing communicator."]},{"begin":"991.040","end":"992.360","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"992.360","end":"1015.600","lines":["She is an amazing novelist. I eagerly seek out anything she writes. She is a beautiful user of language. She could make me envision the world that she was putting together. And she also was not afraid to make difficult characters who are real in the sense that people like them exist out there in the world."]},{"begin":"1015.600","end":"1023.040","lines":["Our final question \u2014 what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"1023.040","end":"1034.360","lines":["I\u2019d say sense \u2014 like the story has to make sense \u2014 humor and then finally suspense. And that comes from like making them want to turn the page."]},{"begin":"1034.360","end":"1060.080","lines":["I like this notion of it just has to make sense. Right. A lot of us take a simple criterion like that \u2014 we\u2019ve definitely on this podcast talked about humor and the value of humor.
