In charting a course through communication, Susan Rice says the best route is often the most direct.","Throughout her career at the forefront of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Rice has been no stranger to high-stakes situations that hinge on clear and candid communication. As she says, \u201cI'm very direct. I don't believe in playing games, going around people, and being passive-aggressive. I shoot straight.\u201d"],"transcript":[{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Being direct and candid can help us in the most challenging of communication situations. My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Today, I\u2019m excited to speak with Susan Rice. Dr. Rice is a visiting fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute at Stanford and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:00:30]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"She previously served as Domestic Policy Advisor for President Biden and was President Obama\u2019s National Security Advisor and the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations. She is the author of the New York Times best-selling memoir, Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, I am so excited to have you join me today and I look forward to the conversation we\u2019re going to have."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Me too. Thanks for having me Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So let\u2019s get started. You have led a variety of teams and organizations throughout your career. Are there any specific leadership principles you follow or use?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:01:06]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I think good leadership, first of all, is about setting a vision and a direction and hopefully an ambitious target. It\u2019s about demonstrating a passion and commitment to achieving that target and hopefully to energizing the folks around you. But to me, ultimately, leadership is about people. It\u2019s about bringing others along with you towards that objective or goal. And to do that, people have to feel not only wedded to the mission, but valued in their role in contributing to the mission. So I try very hard to find the best people."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:01:40]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And then giving those great people the space and the capacity and the power to do what they do best. And give them the expectation that when they need direction or they need top level cover or they need somebody to blast through the barriers or, you know, consummate whatever it is, that they know when and how to seek that direction from me as a leader."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"But I\u2019ve also discovered that for people to feel valued and willing to give their utmost, they\u2019ve got to know that their leaders, their teammates, care about them as human beings. And so, to me, that means that they need to know that their personal lives come first. When the people we need and love need us most, that it\u2019s okay to be there. And that the team will fill in behind you and support you, whether you\u2019re the most senior person on the team or the most junior person on the team."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"When I was National Security Advisor, my mom was very ill and she actually passed in the last month of the Obama administration. And, you know, President Obama very much led the same way. He was a dad, he was a real human being. And he gave me the license to do what I had to do to be able to support my mom, even as I was doing my job twenty-four seven as National Security Advisor. And that\u2019s the same way that I tried to lead my teams and give everybody on the team that same grace."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:03:10]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I appreciate you sharing that personal story, thank you. I think it demonstrates the type of leadership that you believe in. It sounds like it\u2019s about finding the right people, setting standards and mission vision. And really supporting them both in their professional work, but also in their personal lives."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious, I can imagine giving feedback, both positive and constructive, is part of that. How do you approach feedback?"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Giving it, or getting it, or both?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ll take both, but I\u2019m curious about the giving part."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:03:39]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I\u2019m very direct, and I think, you know, the folks I work with expect that what they hear from me is, you know, what they see is what they get. I don\u2019t believe in playing games and going around people and being passive aggressive and all of that stuff. I shoot straight, and if somebody is, you know, doing particularly well, I want to reinforce that and encourage it, especially if there\u2019s been real progress. If somebody is screwing up, you know, I\u2019ll sit them down and explain, you know, what they are doing wrong, what the expectations are, and what I think they need to do to do better."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:04:11]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And, you know, I will try to the best of my ability to do that. Especially in the first instances, in a patient and, you know, kind, if not always gentle way. But I\u2019m not averse to being more forceful if my sense is that there\u2019s not an interest or an effort at remediation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I hear in your answer to your leadership approach and to your giving feedback that being very clear, helping prioritize, and being supportive when appropriate are part of that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:04:38]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Being candid. And you asked, you know, about receiving feedback by the same token. If you give it, you got to be able to take it. And so I\u2019ve really benefited at various stages of my career from colleagues who\u2019ve been, as I would say, kind enough to give me the hard truths or the tough love or whatever you want to call it. To enable me to be better and help me to recognize where I\u2019m falling short."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:05:01]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that\u2019s really important that people not only take the feedback, but seek it out and that\u2019s how we get better. You know, my favorite song from the musical Hamilton is In the Room Where It Happens. And you definitely have been in many of those rooms. What insights can you provide into how best to negotiate in high stake situations?"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Drawing in particular on my time in national security at the United Nations, where for example, I was negotiating regularly with the Chinese and the Russians and other complicated interlocutors on Security Council resolutions, or the like. Or as National Security Advisor negotiating arrangements with foreign governments. I think very important to understand in the first instance what one\u2019s own bottom lines are."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"What do I need to walk away with, must have, in order for this to be successful or acceptable outcome from the people I am negotiating on behalf of. Um, but equally important to try to understand the interests and the motivations and, to the extent possible, the bottom lines of the people on the other side of the table."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Believe it or not, you know, it\u2019s possible to negotiate tough things with competitors or adversaries, if there\u2019s a willingness to understand what is making the other side tick. What they, you know, view as their must haves. And then trying to explore whether there\u2019s any way to get to common ground."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:06:31]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It sounds like to me that in your approach to negotiation, it\u2019s first about clarity in your own position. A bit of empathy to understand other people\u2019s position. And I really like that idea of anchoring the bar high, and that buys you some room to actually move around. So those are some levers that you can pull to help move the negotiation."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I love negotiation, it\u2019s so much fun."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tell me more about that. So in all the roles you had, do you find negotiation enjoyable?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:06:54]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I learned by doing it, that I really enjoyed it. What\u2019s fun about negotiating is that you\u2019re not ever sure where you\u2019re going to end up. It requires a whole range of skills from, you know, intellect to a little bit of, you know, canny, to all of the things I just described, you know, humor, charm. Find that as a direct person, being direct in negotiations actually works much better than being somebody who\u2019s perceived as slippery or elusive or untrustworthy. And then when you succeed, the product is, they\u2019re tangible and the gratification is significant, so I just find it fun."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The reason I was curious is a lot of people I talk to don\u2019t like negotiating. They\u2019d like to avoid it if they could. And it\u2019s interesting to hear that for you, it\u2019s something that\u2019s exciting because it gets to leverage some of the skills that you appreciate and have honed."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I like the outcomes of when you can get somewhere that\u2019s hard, that you didn\u2019t know that you could get to. And, you know, and what you come out with is tangible. It\u2019s not quite immediate gratification, but it\u2019s, you know, relatively quick, tangible gratification."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:07:59]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I appreciate that. And I think it might be motivational to many people for whom negotiation is hard or something they try to avoid."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"What advice can you give to people who find themselves in situations where they stand out as different from others in the groups that they work in? Be it because of their ideas, their gender, their race, cultural background, etcetera. You\u2019ve worked with so many people who are different. What advice do you give to people in those situations?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:08:23]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I mean, this may sound simple and trite, but I think people do best when they are themselves and believe in themselves and are not trying to be something that they\u2019re not. Yeah, I\u2019ve spent much of my career as one of the only, or one of the few black Americans in the room or a woman in the room, or. I could spend a lot of time being anxious about that and maybe, you know, trying to trim my sails or, you know, fit in or in some other way adapt myself to that environment."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:08:53]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And I find one, that\u2019s not very genuine. But more importantly, it\u2019s not very comfortable. And I\u2019m not bringing my best if I were to do that. And so my dad used to have a saying that I really have taken to heart and he was talking about his experience growing up in the segregated South and serving in the segregated Army Air Force during World War II. And then trying to break into the professional world as a PhD in economics in the 1950s when there were very few African Americans."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And his whole career was one of sort of having to be the first or the second through any given door. And he had a saying, which was, if my being black is going to be a problem, it\u2019s going to be a problem for somebody else and not for me. Meaning that if somebody, you know, is trying to make him feel uncomfortable or inferior or in some other way unwelcome in a given setting."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"First of all, it\u2019s about understanding why that person is doing that. They\u2019re doing that because of their own insecurities in all likelihood, or their own need to make another person feel small. And you have an option of embracing their definition of you as your own. Or trying to resist that and building the muscles of mental self-esteem. And not letting other people define you for you."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And that was something that, you know, my parents beat into my head and my heart. And I think it\u2019s helped me quite a bit as I\u2019ve been in environments where I may not have, you know, been an obvious fit in the first instance."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:10:33]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That notion of not letting other people define us I think is a very powerful notion for many people in many situations. I appreciate you sharing that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you three questions. One I\u2019m going to create just for you and the two others are similar that I ask people across all these interviews. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I will do my best."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:10:51]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. I\u2019ve heard you tell this story once live and once elsewhere, about some differences of opinion that exist in your own family. Would you share for our audience how your son, a Stanford student alum, had a different, perhaps political orientation, at least while here, versus yours? And how did you negotiate that? And how did you manage that?"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Well, my eldest child is my son, Jake, as we call him, but his given name is John. Um, has always been really interested in events around him in the world, and as he got older in politics and policy, growing up in Washington, DC, as he did with our family and where I grew up. And yet somehow along the way, somewhere in his early to mid-teens, having once upon a time campaigned with me in the snows of New Hampshire for Barack Obama. He evolved into a rather conservative political mind."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:11:47] And when he got here to Stanford, after a year or so, ended up as president of Stanford College Republicans. And stayed in that role through most of his time at Stanford. And he was not a shy and retiring version of the president of Stanford College Republicans. He was outspoken and unabashed and sought out debate and engagement with the Stanford College Democrats, with other people of different persuasions."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:12:14]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"He brought conservative speakers to campus, some of whom would not have been anything like my cup of tea. And that was challenging. Because I had, by that time, a certain image nationally and he had a very different one. And because of that there was, you know, some national attention or national news media, particularly on the Right, who thought this was, you know, quite delightful."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"But we are very close. And I love both my children, you know, as deeply as it\u2019s possible to do so. But we just disagree on a lot of policy issues. Not all of them, but a lot. And we vote differently. But I\u2019m proud of him because he has the courage of his convictions. And it takes guts, and I admire that. But nonetheless we continue to disagree strenuously on many things, and you know times it can get contentious. Now that he\u2019s grown up, out of the home, married, working, all that stuff, I don\u2019t get to see him that much. So I try really hard not to squander the time that we have arguing about politics. But, you know, it\u2019s a situation I think many people are familiar with. In our family, we try to prioritize the things that we share in our love over our political differences."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So, finding that common ground. I can\u2019t imagine where he gets his confidence."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"From his dad."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I see that. It must be. It must be. I\u2019ll be very curious to get your answer to question number two. Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Well, I\u2019m going to give two probably predictable answers, but they\u2019re honest answers."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:13:46]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Obviously, really admire President Obama as a communicator. He has an extraordinary ability to be relatable and clear. And passionate and funny and emotive and all of these things in different ways at different times. And, you know, as a writer himself, he spends time on his spoken words. And I think is really reflected in how he comes across. So he\u2019s top of the list."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Another is a friend and multiple time former colleague of mine who I admire enormously for her communication skills, Jen Psaki. Who was, most people know as President Biden\u2019s first White House spokesperson. And now, you know, she\u2019s an anchor on MSNBC. But the reason I admire her is, you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a spokesperson with such, you know, clear, direct, plain English way of communicating. But also she parried the press so expertly with humor and forcefulness when needed, but grace. And it, I\u2019m just, watching her dance at that podium was just brilliant and fun."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I hear in both of those responses a respect for people who take the art of communication very seriously and work on their abilities."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My final question for you, what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:15:16]"},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"I think being able to be clear, not convoluted, not overly flowery, just clear and direct and on point is certainly one. Being concise when that\u2019s appropriate. And, you know, none of us are perfect at that, but I think that\u2019s helpful."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"And then structuring, having a structured message so that you\u2019ve given some thought to what it is you\u2019re trying to say and the key points you\u2019re trying to get across, not meandering, not veering, not getting off track. And I think if you have a structure to your thinking and to your message, if you can deliver it without a lot of diversionary flourish. And just be mindful of who it is you\u2019re talking to. Your way of communicating in one venue might differ from that in another. But I think that the key ingredients are usually constants."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:16:08]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"The notion of clarity, concision, structure, and knowing your audience. So well summarized the advice that we have heard across many episodes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you very much for this opportunity to chat. Your candor, your directness, and your role modeling the specific behaviors that you preach and live your life by were really, really powerful. I appreciate your time and for your insight."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"Thank you, Matt. It\u2019s been fun."},{"author":"Susan Rice","text":"[00:16:33]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"[00:16:35] Thank you for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, the podcast.

In our family, we try to prioritize the things that we share in our love over our political differences."]},{"begin":"807.160","end":"812.240","lines":["So, finding that common ground.

He has an extraordinary ability to be relatable and clear. And passionate and funny and emotive and all of these things in different ways at different times. And, you know, as a writer himself, he spends time on his spoken words. And I think is really reflected in how he comes across. So he\u2019s top of the list."]},{"begin":"855.440","end":"900.200","lines":["Another is a friend and multiple time former colleague of mine who I admire enormously for her communication skills, Jen Psaki. Who was, most people know as President Biden\u2019s first White House spokesperson. And now, you know, she\u2019s an anchor on MSNBC. But the reason I admire her is, you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a spokesperson with such, you know, clear, direct, plain English way of communicating. But also she parried the press so expertly with humor and forcefulness when needed, but grace.

And I think if you have a structure to your thinking and to your message, if you can deliver it without a lot of diversionary flourish. And just be mindful of who it is you\u2019re talking to. Your way of communicating in one venue might differ from that in another.
