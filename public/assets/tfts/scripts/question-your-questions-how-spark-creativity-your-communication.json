What do I say? How do I say it? Where do I start? If you\u2019re like many of us, having to communicate in high-stakes situations can really zap your creative juices. Finding inspiration and catalyzing your creativity can really help."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Hi. My name is Matt Abrahams. And I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to \u201cThink Fast, Talk Smart,\u201d the podcast. Today, I am thrilled to be joined by Tina Seelig, who is a professor of the practice in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"She is also a faculty director at the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Tina teaches courses on creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"She is the author of many books including Creativity Rules: Get Ideas Out of Your Head and Into the World and inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity. Tina is a passionate, student-centered teacher who is just a dynamo to learn from. Welcome, Tina."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"It\u2019s a pleasure to be here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great. Thank you. Shall we jump right in?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You bet."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So how can people develop a more creative, innovative approach to their communication?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"This is really, really important. I know that you think about this a lot. And what I\u2019m going to tell you probably is something that you think about all the time. But my world opened up dramatically when I realized the power of storytelling."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"I saw people who were great communicators. But what I didn\u2019t realize is how they were using storytelling to really effectively get their message across."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So at this point, I teach storytelling tools and techniques and the power of storytelling in almost every one of my classes because, no matter how exciting your idea is, if you can\u2019t tell a story that truly engages other people and make people feel excited about the idea, the whole thing is going to fall flat."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So what are one or two of the things you teach in that storytelling that really could help everybody listening in?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Great. So I\u2019m a huge fan of the story spine. Are you familiar with that \u2013 [crosstalk]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am. But why don\u2019t you share with others?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Yeah. So the story spine is super simple. It starts out like this: once upon a time and every day. And of course, that sounds familiar. But it essentially sets the stage for where you are now. You know, once upon a time. And describe the problem and the consequences of that problem."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And then, after that is until one day. And that is your intervention. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do that\u2019s going to change the plot. And after that, it\u2019s because of that and because of that and because of that and because of that."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You can have as many because of thats \u2013 that\u2019s essentially the consequences of your intervention. And it ends with an ever since then. Okay. So it then paints a picture of the world after your intervention has essentially been adopted by the world."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So it goes once upon a time and every day, until one day and because of that and because of that and because of that until finally and ever since then. Now, it sounds really, really simple. But it\u2019s actually quite difficult to do."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So I give my students \u2013 I\u2019ll give them an opening prompt like, \u201cThere once was a girl who dreamed of flying.\u201d Or it could be some problem like, you know, \u201cThere are 500 million people in the world who suffer from some ailment.\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And I set the stage for a problem and then have them tell a story. It\u2019s really amazing to see them start mastering these skills that allow them to then communicate the ideas they come up with in class to really share those ideas that are really compelling [like]."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I really like leveraging the story spine in that way. I use the story spine as an example of the power of structure in communication in general. And what\u2019s so cool about the story spine is that it really invites that creativity from the get-go."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And it requires you to really stay focused on your audience and their needs. To my mind, one of the most important things of any storytelling is making sure that you engage the audience and make it relevant to them. And that approach that you take puts that at the forefront. So that\u2019s really powerful."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Yeah. I also \u2013 one of the other things I think is extremely important is to think about the hook at the beginning of the story. And there\u2019s so many ways to have a great hook. It could be a really surprising fact. It could be something funny."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"It could be a question. In fact, I usually like to start with a question, a provocative question because it very clearly engages the audience in thinking about, wow, how would I answer that question? That\u2019s a really provocative question."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So Tina, I am literally picking up my soapbox. I am putting down and now standing on top of it because you just touched something that is so important to me. I am on a personal mission to have people stop starting their presentations and meetings with, \u201cHi. My name is \u2013\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You bet."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u201c\u2013 and today, I\u2019m going to tell you about \u2013\u201d that is so banal, so boring. And what you just mentioned about how to start in a provocative, engaging way can dramatically change an interaction, a communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And it certain helps in storytelling. So thank you for giving me an opportunity to share that we have to change the way we start because it just \u2013 it puts people in a position of passiveness and disengagement if we don\u2019t do it right."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"I completely agree. In fact, here\u2019s a fun thing that you might want to try in your classes as well. Just a couple years ago, we started a new program. And the students would go around the room and introduce themselves."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And they do this like, \u201cI\u2019m Joe Schmoe. And I study this. And my research is that.\u201d And everybody is, you know, snoring. So we switched around. One of the students started using a different framework. And it caught on."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And this is the framework. She started out saying, \u201cImagine a world where \u2013\u201d and then she would talk about, you know, \u201cImagine a world where we traveled to space as frequently as we get on an airplane.\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And then, she\u2019d say, \u201cAnd my name is so-and-so. And this is what I\u2019m excited about. And this is what I\u2019m studying that\u2019s going to help me get there.\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So we now do that in all the introductions. The students all have to start out with what they\u2019re passionate about. Imagine a world where \u2013 and then, they have to start with that before they tell anyone who they are or what they\u2019re studying."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love that. I love that. And it dovetails nicely with what I teach, which is start like you\u2019re an action movie. All action movies start with action. And then, you learn the title of the movie and the credits. And what you\u2019re doing in those introductions is the same thing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Start by getting people passionate and engaged. And then, you can introduce yourself. I love it. I love it. So my next question has to do with what we spoke about in the introduction to this podcast about feeling stuck about how and where to start when we create a high-stakes communication. What advice and guidance do you have for sparking our creativity and getting us started in on our communication?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Yeah. That\u2019s a really good question. As with most problems, the best place to start is with really understanding the needs. And this starts with asking questions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Hmm."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So sparking communication starts with asking why or what or how. So having a mindset of curiosity opens the door to great communication. And the most questions you ask, the more you learn, the more engaged you will be with others."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. I think a lot of us go into these things saying I have to say all this, or this is my time limit. And I feel a lot of pressure. And I really like this idea of asking questions. Do you have other advice on question asking?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"My goodness. I spend a lot of time in my classes teaching students how to ask questions. The question you ask is the frame into which an answer will fall. And this might sound like, what are you talking about?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"But I can give you some really interesting examples that hopefully will just like blow your mind and make you realize how powerful this is. [Would you like an example]?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I would love for you to do that. I\u2019d love to hear some examples because that statement about the frame sounds very Zen-like. So I\u2019d love to hear what it means."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"It is actually. It\u2019s so core to everything we do. I can give you several examples in fact. Let\u2019s start with a simple example. Okay. I could ask you to build a bridge. And you can go off and build that bridge. Or you could come back and say, \u201cWell, Tina, why do you need a bridge?\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And I\u2019d say, \u201cWell, I need a bridge to get the other side of a river.\u201d And you go, \u201cWow. Well, there are lots of ways to get to the other side of the river.\u201d I mean, Matt, how many other ways are there to get to the other side of the river. What could you do?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I could think of three or four different ways right away: get a boat, swim across, things like that."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Right. Exactly, a tunnel, a hot-air balloon, you know, all sorts of ways to get across. So if I ask the question, do you want to \u2013 how to get across the river, it\u2019s a really different solution set than how do you build a bridge?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"But my favorite example is one I use in my classes where I have the students come up with all the things they hate about their suitcase."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Of course, we\u2019re not using as many suitcases right now because we\u2019re not traveling as much. But you know, what are all the things? And they quickly make a list of: it\u2019s too heavy; the clothes get wrinkled; the wheels get locked; the handle doesn\u2019t work; all sorts of things, you know; it\u2019s not the right size."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And so I go, \u201cOkay. Great. Go design now a brand-new suitcase.\u201d And they come back with all these new fancy suitcases with all of these new features. And they think they\u2019ve done a good job until I say, \u201cDid we ask the right question?\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Because the real question is, why \u2013 just like why do you need a bridge, you know, why do you need to go across a river \u2013 the question is, why do you need a suitcase?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So the initial answer \u2013 people think I\u2019m just being flippant. And they go, \u201cWell, you know, to carry my stuff.\u201d But that\u2019s actually not why you use a suitcase. Nobody likes to carry a suitcase. We use a suitcase despite the fact that we hate packing it."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"We hate dragging it around. We hate it getting lost. We hate storing it. And yet, we use it. And we assume that we need a suitcase. But the real reason \u2013 when you start going down that rabbit hole, you start realizing the real reason you use a suitcase is to have the things you need at your destination."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm. Sure."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So how might you solve that problem? And they look at me and go, \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of interesting. How might I solve that problem?\u201d And I urge them to think not just today. But what could you do in five years or 10 years or 50 years to solve this problem?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So you could say, \u201cWell, what if I had 3D printed clothes?\u201d So essentially, my closet, you know, had a virtual closet in the cloud, okay, so that, when I get to my destination, I go, gosh. I really wish I had a jacket. I\u2019m going to print out my down jacket."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Or gosh, I really wish I had hiking boots. And I\u2019d print them out. And at the end of your trip, you kind of melt them back down. They go back up in the cloud. Or maybe there\u2019s Airbnb for clothes. Right. You go somewhere, and you rent all your clothes. And then, you give them back."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Or maybe your suitcase \u2013 maybe you have one suitcase that travels around the world independent of you. And you just go online and say, \u201cSuitcase, go to Paris. Suitcase, go to Rome.\u201d So \u2013 and it follows you."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So the fact is that you need to question the questions you ask. And this is one of the most powerful things you can do to unlock really, really innovative solutions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, first, I\u2019d love to live in that reality because I hate schlepping suitcases. But second, the idea that we have to question our questions to spark creativity can help in not just creating communication but I think in lots of facets of our life. Thank you for sharing that."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As you\u2019ve just demonstrated, you\u2019re a master teacher. And I know you have embraced virtual teaching, as many of us are having to do. Can you share best practices you\u2019ve developed that can help all of us as we communicate more and more remotely?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You bet. I think about this a lot. It is a really different learning environment. And a virtual classroom is quite different than an in-person class. I am trying to figure out, how do I make that experience as powerful as possible for the students?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And one of the first things you have to think about is setting the stage. Right. And when you go into a classroom \u2013 it\u2019s one of the reasons I teach in the D school is the space is so great. And I can set the stage for a class."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"But since I can\u2019t do that online, how can I set the stage? So I do it in a number of different ways. One is I always start my classes off playing music. And I play some upbeat music so that everyone starts out actually sort of like dancing."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You know, everyone is bopping around before we start the class. It sets the stage. It allows us to know we\u2019re now moving into the classroom. And then, we turn off the music. We start. The other thing is I often have the students \u2013 we all decide where we\u2019re going to go."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"We\u2019re like, okay. This week, we\u2019re going to meet in Antarctica. Everybody changes their backdrop to a picture from Antarctica. Or we\u2019re going to go to New Zealand. So there\u2019s just a fun way of getting everyone in the space."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And you sort of set the stage, the fact that you\u2019re together. You\u2019ve all listened to the same music. You have the same background. And we\u2019re now ready to dive in."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Also, I think it\u2019s really important to change up activities really quickly, like every 10 to 15 minutes. I almost feel it\u2019s almost like Sesame Street, you know. Every 10 to 15 minutes, you need to change, you know, watching a video to doing an activity to breaking into small groups."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You know, folks get bored looking at a screen if things are static. So you need to plan a lot in advance. I view myself as more of a producer when I\u2019m planning an online class. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of thought that goes into essentially scripting the whole experience."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So the point about setting atmosphere upfront I think can make a really big difference. You\u2019re doing it with music and common backgrounds. But just taking time to think about how do we set the tone for what we want this communication experience to be like is really important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And your colleague, Bob Sutton, and I talked very similarly about switching things up every 10 to 15 minutes. And that\u2019s really important. And that notion you mentioned actually was just something I highlighted recently when I was asked about teaching and presenting virtually and that notion of being a producer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So we often think, hey, I just have to focus on my meeting contribution or the agenda or my presentation. But when you\u2019re presenting virtually, you have to have this other task to focus on, which is the production aspect, the timing of it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"When do I do things? Do I have things lined up? So it can be an added burden. But if done well, it can really change the engagement. And the whole interaction can be much more powerful and memorable."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Exactly. One of the other things I do is I always have a check-in with the students. And it\u2019s interesting. I used to do it in my classrooms where we\u2019d stand in a big circle. And everybody would say a sentence about what\u2019s going on in their life."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And I\u2019m like, [now] I\u2019m going to go to Yosemite this weekend. Or I\u2019ve got a big exam after this. Or I just have a job interview, whatever it is. But guess what? I can do this now on a Zoom whiteboard. And it happens really efficiently."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Everyone can kind of populate it. I can ask a different question like, \u201cWhat are you looking forward to? Or what\u2019s your best quarantine treat?\u201d or, you know, anything you want. And people will quickly populate it. And you get this wonderful snapshot of where everyone in the class is at the moment."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Again, it\u2019s bringing people into the room, setting the tone and the mode and \u2013"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You and I were talking about \u2013 just before we started recording this podcast \u2013 this notion that people are so focused on the deficiencies and the things we\u2019re missing in the virtual environment when, in fact, there are some things that can actually help."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And that notion of using a tool like a whiteboard that\u2019s collaborative is something that would be really hard to do in person, yet virtually we can do it. So taking time to embrace what this environment can allow us to do I think is also very important."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"I couldn\u2019t agree more. There are some things that actually work much better online than they do in person. Of course, there\u2019s some things that have been sacrificed but to look at the things that work well as opposed to things that don\u2019t."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm. Absolutely. You know, you have had amazing opportunities to interview and work with lots of entrepreneurs. Do you have any key insights or takeaways that you\u2019ve gleaned over the years that you could share with us that we could benefit from?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Sure. There are so many. One that comes to mind is that failure is a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey and that, if you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s really innovative, really hard, that no one\u2019s done before, there are bound to be false starts and missteps."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"So you need to be prepared for setbacks. And you need to think failure as an opportunity to redirect your energy and attention. And that\u2019s really important is having a mindset of resilience and bouncing back."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Another one is then and all you have is your reputation. If others don\u2019t trust you, if they don\u2019t find you to be authentic, then it\u2019s going to be really difficult to bring your ideas to life. You need to make sure that you spend time thinking about your values, and make sure that you uphold them so that you can build a community that really is supportive and trusting and works really well together."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And my favorite lesson is that there is a huge benefit in seeing problems as opportunities. And with that mindset, the world is opportunity rich. It\u2019s full of possibility. Essentially, entrepreneurs are ultimately optimists who are able to see and seize opportunities that others don\u2019t immediately see."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"In fact, if you come to our office at the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, you\u2019ll see painted on the walls in very big letters \u2013 on one wall, it says, \u201cEvery problem is an opportunity. The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And on another wall, it says, \u201cEntrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible.\u201d And these are the mindsets I think that are extremely important and that very successful entrepreneurs have \u2013 embody them."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow. Those are really powerful lessons. And they echo very nicely some of the topics that we\u2019ve covered on the podcast in terms of failure and reputation and reframing things not as problems but opportunities."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And all of us can benefit from reflecting on that and using those as a way to guide us as we are entrepreneurial in whatever our endeavors are. So thank you for sharing those. Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions that I ask everyone who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. All right. Well, question number one, if you were to capture the best communication advice you\u2019ve ever received as a five-to-seven-word presentation slide title, what would that be?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Wow. That\u2019s so interesting. I\u2019m going to hearken back to what we talked about before. And I would say know your first and last words. When you are giving a talk, you should know where you\u2019re starting and nail it and have that opening line or the opening story completely set. And you should know the last words."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Everyone knows in the middle it can sort of \u2013 it can move a little more organically. But being able to like nail the first and last words, you end up really engaging people in a way that they know where you are. They know where you\u2019re going. And they\u2019re with you until the end."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That is such profound and useful advice. A lot of people get nervous. So they really focus on what they want to say first. But many people just figure, when I get to the end, I\u2019ll just know how to wrap it up. And I\u2019ll tell you, in all my work that I do, the most frequent ending I hear is, \u201cUh, I guess we\u2019re out of time. Thanks.\u201d"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Exactly. Exactly. Ridiculous. Or they just sort of trail off at the end and turn around and walk off the stage. Wow."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. So that advice \u2013 very sagely. Not only should you know the first words but also those last words. Great. Let me ask you question number two. And I\u2019ll be very curious to hear your answer to this. Who is a communicator that you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"We have had so many amazing speakers. I think the most compelling speaker I have heard on our stage is Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy. He is the only speaker in the series that has ever received a standing ovation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wow."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"His storytelling ability is incredible. He\u2019s super funny. He\u2019s really humble. And he used such motivating examples that everyone was sitting on the edge of their seat. I have to say I just aspire to being such a masterful storyteller and communicator as he is."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Very cool. I have seen him speak. And I completely agree. And I have to fess up to something. He actually exercises at the same gym that I belong to. And I have wanted to go up to him, but I am way too intimidated. So \u2013 [laughs]"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Well, he\u2019s [so] humble. You should just go say hello."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I w \u2013 but I\u2019m often really sweaty. Anyway \u2013 but \u2013"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"[laughs]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No. He\u2019s a great speaker and a great guy."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"You can tell him I told you to do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay. I\u2019ll say Tina told me. And I\u2019ve learned in my life, Tina, that, if I follow your advice, good things happen. So thank you. All right. Question number three \u2013 what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Well, you know what\u2019s interesting. I do a lot of public speaking. And I did a little exercise a couple of years ago, a project called 60 weeks to 60. And in the 60 weeks up until my 60th birthday, I gave myself different challenges."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"And one of them was that I went to a professional speaking coach. And she was amazing. She watched videos of my talking. And some of the most important things I learned from her were to stand tall. You know, just hold the space."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Sometimes \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a tendency to want to rush through what you\u2019re saying and to kind of be \u2013 feel like somehow you\u2019re taking up people\u2019s time. But they\u2019re there to hear you. So you want to stand tall, slow down and tell the story."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Those three bits of advice are fantastic, helpful and direct. And many people, if they were to take time to watch their videos and have others give them feedback, would note exactly what you learned, that these are things that we often don\u2019t do. And yet, they make a big difference. Stand tall. Slow down. Tell a story. Great advice."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And Tina, the whole conversation was fantastic. Thank you. As I knew would be the case, your insights and ideas about creativity and communication were spot on, very helpful. And everyone listening can benefit from taking the bits of advice you shared into practice and in really thinking about how they themselves can be both creative and innovative. Thank you so much."},{"author":"Tina Seelig","text":"Thank you.

And the students would go around the room and introduce themselves."]},{"begin":"335.040","end":"347.360","lines":["And they do this like, \u201cI\u2019m Joe Schmoe. And I study this. And my research is that.\u201d And everybody is, you know, snoring. So we switched around. One of the students started using a different framework. And it caught on."]},{"begin":"347.360","end":"359.160","lines":["And this is the framework. She started out saying, \u201cImagine a world where \u2013\u201d and then she would talk about, you know, \u201cImagine a world where we traveled to space as frequently as we get on an airplane.\u201d"]},{"begin":"359.160","end":"366.360","lines":["And then, she\u2019d say, \u201cAnd my name is so-and-so.

And this is what I\u2019m studying that\u2019s going to help me get there.\u201d"]},{"begin":"366.360","end":"378.560","lines":["So we now do that in all the introductions. The students all have to start out with what they\u2019re passionate about. Imagine a world where \u2013 and then, they have to start with that before they tell anyone who they are or what they\u2019re studying."]},{"begin":"378.560","end":"392.600","lines":["I love that. I love that. And it dovetails nicely with what I teach, which is start like you\u2019re an action movie. All action movies start with action. And then, you learn the title of the movie and the credits. And what you\u2019re doing in those introductions is the same thing."]},{"begin":"392.600","end":"415.920","lines":["Start by getting people passionate and engaged. And then, you can introduce yourself. I love it. I love it. So my next question has to do with what we spoke about in the introduction to this podcast about feeling stuck about how and where to start when we create a high-stakes communication. What advice and guidance do you have for sparking our creativity and getting us started in on our communication?"]},{"begin":"415.920","end":"426.240","lines":["Yeah. That\u2019s a really good question. As with most problems, the best place to start is with really understanding the needs. And this starts with asking questions."]},{"begin":"426.240","end":"426.480","lines":["Hmm."]},{"begin":"426.480","end":"440.120","lines":["So sparking communication starts with asking why or what or how. So having a mindset of curiosity opens the door to great communication. And the most questions you ask, the more you learn, the more engaged you will be with others."]},{"begin":"440.120","end":"451.280","lines":["Yeah. I think a lot of us go into these things saying I have to say all this, or this is my time limit. And I feel a lot of pressure. And I really like this idea of asking questions. Do you have other advice on question asking?"]},{"begin":"451.280","end":"461.120","lines":["My goodness. I spend a lot of time in my classes teaching students how to ask questions. The question you ask is the frame into which an answer will fall. And this might sound like, what are you talking about?"]},{"begin":"461.120","end":"470.800","lines":["But I can give you some really interesting examples that hopefully will just like blow your mind and make you realize how powerful this is. [Would you like an example]?"]},{"begin":"470.800","end":"477.960","lines":["I would love for you to do that. I\u2019d love to hear some examples because that statement about the frame sounds very Zen-like. So I\u2019d love to hear what it means."]},{"begin":"477.960","end":"494.360","lines":["It is actually. It\u2019s so core to everything we do. I can give you several examples in fact. Let\u2019s start with a simple example. Okay. I could ask you to build a bridge. And you can go off and build that bridge. Or you could come back and say, \u201cWell, Tina, why do you need a bridge?\u201d"]},{"begin":"494.360","end":"504.640","lines":["And I\u2019d say, \u201cWell, I need a bridge to get the other side of a river.\u201d And you go, \u201cWow. Well, there are lots of ways to get to the other side of the river.\u201d I mean, Matt, how many other ways are there to get to the other side of the river. What could you do?"]},{"begin":"504.640","end":"510.200","lines":["I could think of three or four different ways right away: get a boat, swim across, things like that."]},{"begin":"510.200","end":"522.280","lines":["Right. Exactly, a tunnel, a hot-air balloon, you know, all sorts of ways to get across. So if I ask the question, do you want to \u2013 how to get across the river, it\u2019s a really different solution set than how do you build a bridge?"]},{"begin":"522.280","end":"528.400","lines":["But my favorite example is one I use in my classes where I have the students come up with all the things they hate about their suitcase."]},{"begin":"528.400","end":"544.200","lines":["Of course, we\u2019re not using as many suitcases right now because we\u2019re not traveling as much. But you know, what are all the things? And they quickly make a list of: it\u2019s too heavy; the clothes get wrinkled; the wheels get locked; the handle doesn\u2019t work; all sorts of things, you know; it\u2019s not the right size."]},{"begin":"544.200","end":"559.640","lines":["And so I go, \u201cOkay. Great. Go design now a brand-new suitcase.\u201d And they come back with all these new fancy suitcases with all of these new features. And they think they\u2019ve done a good job until I say, \u201cDid we ask the right question?\u201d"]},{"begin":"559.640","end":"568.280","lines":["Because the real question is, why \u2013 just like why do you need a bridge, you know, why do you need to go across a river \u2013 the question is, why do you need a suitcase?"]},{"begin":"568.280","end":"582.720","lines":["So the initial answer \u2013 people think I\u2019m just being flippant. And they go, \u201cWell, you know, to carry my stuff.\u201d But that\u2019s actually not why you use a suitcase. Nobody likes to carry a suitcase. We use a suitcase despite the fact that we hate packing it."]},{"begin":"582.720","end":"601.200","lines":["We hate dragging it around. We hate it getting lost. We hate storing it. And yet, we use it. And we assume that we need a suitcase. But the real reason \u2013 when you start going down that rabbit hole, you start realizing the real reason you use a suitcase is to have the things you need at your destination."]},{"begin":"601.200","end":"602.360","lines":["Mm-hmm. Sure."]},{"begin":"602.360","end":"615.840","lines":["So how might you solve that problem? And they look at me and go, \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of interesting. How might I solve that problem?\u201d And I urge them to think not just today. But what could you do in five years or 10 years or 50 years to solve this problem?"]},{"begin":"615.840","end":"630.600","lines":["So you could say, \u201cWell, what if I had 3D printed clothes?\u201d So essentially, my closet, you know, had a virtual closet in the cloud, okay, so that, when I get to my destination, I go, gosh. I really wish I had a jacket. I\u2019m going to print out my down jacket."]},{"begin":"630.600","end":"645.520","lines":["Or gosh, I really wish I had hiking boots. And I\u2019d print them out. And at the end of your trip, you kind of melt them back down. They go back up in the cloud. Or maybe there\u2019s Airbnb for clothes. Right. You go somewhere, and you rent all your clothes. And then, you give them back."]},{"begin":"645.520","end":"657.360","lines":["Or maybe your suitcase \u2013 maybe you have one suitcase that travels around the world independent of you. And you just go online and say, \u201cSuitcase, go to Paris. Suitcase, go to Rome.\u201d So \u2013 and it follows you."]},{"begin":"657.360","end":"668.400","lines":["So the fact is that you need to question the questions you ask. And this is one of the most powerful things you can do to unlock really, really innovative solutions."]},{"begin":"668.400","end":"684.360","lines":["Well, first, I\u2019d love to live in that reality because I hate schlepping suitcases. But second, the idea that we have to question our questions to spark creativity can help in not just creating communication but I think in lots of facets of our life. Thank you for sharing that."]},{"begin":"684.360","end":"698.200","lines":["As you\u2019ve just demonstrated, you\u2019re a master teacher. And I know you have embraced virtual teaching, as many of us are having to do. Can you share best practices you\u2019ve developed that can help all of us as we communicate more and more remotely?"]},{"begin":"698.200","end":"713.760","lines":["You bet. I think about this a lot. It is a really different learning environment. And a virtual classroom is quite different than an in-person class. I am trying to figure out, how do I make that experience as powerful as possible for the students?"]},{"begin":"713.760","end":"724.880","lines":["And one of the first things you have to think about is setting the stage. Right. And when you go into a classroom \u2013 it\u2019s one of the reasons I teach in the D school is the space is so great. And I can set the stage for a class."]},{"begin":"724.880","end":"741.280","lines":["But since I can\u2019t do that online, how can I set the stage? So I do it in a number of different ways. One is I always start my classes off playing music. And I play some upbeat music so that everyone starts out actually sort of like dancing."]},{"begin":"741.280","end":"755.800","lines":["You know, everyone is bopping around before we start the class. It sets the stage. It allows us to know we\u2019re now moving into the classroom. And then, we turn off the music. We start. The other thing is I often have the students \u2013 we all decide where we\u2019re going to go."]},{"begin":"755.800","end":"767.280","lines":["We\u2019re like, okay. This week, we\u2019re going to meet in Antarctica. Everybody changes their backdrop to a picture from Antarctica. Or we\u2019re going to go to New Zealand. So there\u2019s just a fun way of getting everyone in the space."]},{"begin":"767.280","end":"775.360","lines":["And you sort of set the stage, the fact that you\u2019re together. You\u2019ve all listened to the same music. You have the same background. And we\u2019re now ready to dive in."]},{"begin":"775.360","end":"794.040","lines":["Also, I think it\u2019s really important to change up activities really quickly, like every 10 to 15 minutes. I almost feel it\u2019s almost like Sesame Street, you know. Every 10 to 15 minutes, you need to change, you know, watching a video to doing an activity to breaking into small groups."]},{"begin":"794.040","end":"810.960","lines":["You know, folks get bored looking at a screen if things are static. So you need to plan a lot in advance. I view myself as more of a producer when I\u2019m planning an online class. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of thought that goes into essentially scripting the whole experience."]},{"begin":"810.960","end":"827.000","lines":["So the point about setting atmosphere upfront I think can make a really big difference. You\u2019re doing it with music and common backgrounds. But just taking time to think about how do we set the tone for what we want this communication experience to be like is really important."]},{"begin":"827.000","end":"843.760","lines":["And your colleague, Bob Sutton, and I talked very similarly about switching things up every 10 to 15 minutes. And that\u2019s really important. And that notion you mentioned actually was just something I highlighted recently when I was asked about teaching and presenting virtually and that notion of being a producer."]},{"begin":"843.760","end":"857.440","lines":["So we often think, hey, I just have to focus on my meeting contribution or the agenda or my presentation. But when you\u2019re presenting virtually, you have to have this other task to focus on, which is the production aspect, the timing of it."]},{"begin":"857.440","end":"871.080","lines":["When do I do things? Do I have things lined up? So it can be an added burden. But if done well, it can really change the engagement. And the whole interaction can be much more powerful and memorable."]},{"begin":"871.080","end":"883.240","lines":["Exactly. One of the other things I do is I always have a check-in with the students. And it\u2019s interesting. I used to do it in my classrooms where we\u2019d stand in a big circle. And everybody would say a sentence about what\u2019s going on in their life."]},{"begin":"883.240","end":"893.680","lines":["And I\u2019m like, [now] I\u2019m going to go to Yosemite this weekend.

And it happens really efficiently."]},{"begin":"893.680","end":"908.960","lines":["Everyone can kind of populate it. I can ask a different question like, \u201cWhat are you looking forward to? Or what\u2019s your best quarantine treat?\u201d or, you know, anything you want. And people will quickly populate it. And you get this wonderful snapshot of where everyone in the class is at the moment."]},{"begin":"908.960","end":"913.560","lines":["Again, it\u2019s bringing people into the room, setting the tone and the mode and \u2013"]},{"begin":"913.560","end":"914.480","lines":["Exactly."]},{"begin":"914.480","end":"928.200","lines":["You and I were talking about \u2013 just before we started recording this podcast \u2013 this notion that people are so focused on the deficiencies and the things we\u2019re missing in the virtual environment when, in fact, there are some things that can actually help."]},{"begin":"928.200","end":"942.680","lines":["And that notion of using a tool like a whiteboard that\u2019s collaborative is something that would be really hard to do in person, yet virtually we can do it. So taking time to embrace what this environment can allow us to do I think is also very important."]},{"begin":"942.680","end":"953.440","lines":["I couldn\u2019t agree more. There are some things that actually work much better online than they do in person. Of course, there\u2019s some things that have been sacrificed but to look at the things that work well as opposed to things that don\u2019t."]},{"begin":"953.440","end":"968.840","lines":["Mm-hmm. Absolutely. You know, you have had amazing opportunities to interview and work with lots of entrepreneurs. Do you have any key insights or takeaways that you\u2019ve gleaned over the years that you could share with us that we could benefit from?"]},{"begin":"968.840","end":"983.320","lines":["Sure. There are so many. One that comes to mind is that failure is a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey and that, if you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s really innovative, really hard, that no one\u2019s done before, there are bound to be false starts and missteps."]},{"begin":"983.320","end":"997.480","lines":["So you need to be prepared for setbacks. And you need to think failure as an opportunity to redirect your energy and attention. And that\u2019s really important is having a mindset of resilience and bouncing back."]},{"begin":"997.480","end":"1021.160","lines":["Another one is then and all you have is your reputation. If others don\u2019t trust you, if they don\u2019t find you to be authentic, then it\u2019s going to be really difficult to bring your ideas to life. You need to make sure that you spend time thinking about your values, and make sure that you uphold them so that you can build a community that really is supportive and trusting and works really well together."]},{"begin":"1021.160","end":"1040.200","lines":["And my favorite lesson is that there is a huge benefit in seeing problems as opportunities. And with that mindset, the world is opportunity rich. It\u2019s full of possibility. Essentially, entrepreneurs are ultimately optimists who are able to see and seize opportunities that others don\u2019t immediately see."]},{"begin":"1040.200","end":"1051.000","lines":["In fact, if you come to our office at the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, you\u2019ll see painted on the walls in very big letters \u2013 on one wall, it says, \u201cEvery problem is an opportunity.

Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"1099.960","end":"1100.680","lines":["Sure."]},{"begin":"1100.680","end":"1115.200","lines":["Excellent. All right.

That\u2019s so interesting. I\u2019m going to hearken back to what we talked about before. And I would say know your first and last words.

And you should know the last words."]},{"begin":"1134.200","end":"1145.200","lines":["Everyone knows in the middle it can sort of \u2013 it can move a little more organically.
