  "intro": [
    "Artificial intelligence can now do a lot of things. But if you're worried about it taking your place as a communicator, Russ Altman says you need to question why you're communicating in the first place.",
    "Altman is a professor of bioengineering, a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and host of Stanford University School of Engineering's podcast, The Future of Everything. According to Altman, advancing technology isn't a threat to human creativity and connection but a tool we can use to raise our own standards for communication."

AI in general has exposed lots of things that were hidden in our society. So a lot of people hear about bias and unfairness, and that is a problem with AI. On the other hand, it was a problem before and in some ways we need to give AI credit for exposing the unfairness and giving us something that we can work on to try to improve. And the reason I mention this is I think for communication in some ways it\u2019s the same answer."

Do I have a message? Because really, if those things are true, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. It should actually just help you amplify and improve your message. So I think that we\u2019re at a time now where people have to ask hard questions about why they\u2019re communicating and how they communicate. And AI is bringing these issues to the fore that were kind of insidiously in the background. So you can see I\u2019m an AI optimist and I think this will help."

Then you have to make the case that there\u2019s an opportunity that you and maybe others, but certainly you have.

Regardless of if it\u2019s a proposal or a pitch or a presentation. But this notion of where we are to where we\u2019re going to. From to to is so important in pitches and presentations.

We always say you might have one good anecdote and that doesn\u2019t replace lots of actual data. But I\u2019m afraid that sometimes, a lot of times, a good story does stand in for a lot of data because it\u2019s so compelling to the human mind. So we\u2019re always looking for stories."

You have to be willing to stop the conversation cold and say, oh, you just said NIH. That\u2019s the National Institutes of Health, they fund research in America.

And then it\u2019s practice. And one of the great thing I love both about this podcast and about your book is you don\u2019t say that you either got it or you don\u2019t got it.

Something that I think can also be helpful, and I\u2019d love to get your input on this, is there\u2019s work you can do in advance. So you can actually stockpile some stories or think about some potential analogies that might work. It doesn\u2019t all have to happen in the moment, you can pull them in. And at the same time, some pre work you can do is you can prepare the audience. So in a meeting invite, for example, you could say, and we\u2019re going to be talking about concepts like this. So people come in primed, which I think makes your job easier. What are your thoughts on that kind of pre work?"

And, before I talk to you, before I talk to anybody, I spend the night before basically Google stalking you, looking at what have you said? What have you done?

Because they come to it thinking that questions are an attack. And so they get defensive, their answers are almost off putting. And so there\u2019s a mentorship that you do to say, you need to consider every question as a little gift. It\u2019s a gift. It shows I listened to what you just said, I\u2019ve processed it.

As you may have come to your attention, the world is currently facing a lot of problems and it\u2019s very easy to get very negative. And if you want to combat that negativity, be involved in an admissions process or a hiring process of young people, like for their first job or for their next job. If you\u2019re not inspired, then I think you need to do some deep introspection."

And I say, it\u2019s us that\u2019s causing the problems. Because if you come in and see my students or the people I coach, there\u2019s a lot of hope and there\u2019s a lot of excitement.

And if you can do something with a sense of joy, why not do it with a sense of joy? So even if it\u2019s the most mundane message, think about how can I make this a positive experience for me and for the person who\u2019s about to listen to me and have a conversation with me."

But their passion and their ability to connect it to me and make it engaging makes a big difference."
