Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am very excited to talk with Jeremy Utley. Jeremy is the director of Executive Education at Stanford\u2019s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, also known as the d.school, where he co-leads the d.school\u2019s Launchpad Venture Accelerator. He hosts Stanford\u2019s Masters of Creativity Web series. I look forward to talking about that. And along with Perry Klebahn, he recently published the book, Ideaflow: The Only Business Metric That Matters. Welcome, Jeremy. Thanks for being here. I\u2019m super-excited for our conversation."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah. Me, too. Thanks for having me."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Let\u2019s jump in. You seem to have found a great niche for yourself straddling the business and creative worlds, and I know you have some strong beliefs about innovation in business. Can you share your perspective and what mindset you suggest people take when it comes to innovation in business?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah. A lot of people say, \u201cI\u2019m an ideas guy,\u201d and \u2026 Not me \u2014 I mean, people call me an ideas guy \u2014 but people say of themselves: \u201cI\u2019m an ideas guy. I love ideas.\u201d I respectfully say: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u201cYou are an idea guy.\u201d And it\u2019s a key distinction. All over the world \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter where I am, it doesn\u2019t matter what culture it is \u2014 when people ask me what I do, I say: \u201cI help people come up with ideas.\u201d And universally I get the same response, if I\u2019m in Japan or Hong Kong or Des Moines, Iowa: \u201cHow do you come up with good ideas?\u201d And do you know what I say? I say: \u201cWho said anything about good? I didn\u2019t say I help people come up with good ideas.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I see."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"When people say, \u201cI\u2019m an ideas guy,\u201d what they mean is they like new things. What I am saying when I say \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re an idea guy,\u201d I\u2019m speaking of a cognitive truth, which is every single one of us \u2014 it\u2019s not an accusation; I\u2019m as guilty as anybody else \u2014 every single one of us is prone to what Abraham Luchins in 1942 called the \u201cEinstellung effect.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tell me about that."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Well, I like to think of it as the anti-Einstein effect. It\u2019s what keeps us from our most breakthrough opportunities. And what Luchins demonstrated and what researchers at Oxford have subsequently demonstrated is that human beings, when they think of a solution to a problem, one, they stop thinking of other solutions, and two, they\u2019re incapable of seeing better solutions."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So they really lock in on that one solution, and it blinds them."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So when you say you\u2019re an ideas guy, I like to joke, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re an idea guy,\u201d because I am, too \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u2014 which is to say the tendency of the human brain is to fixate on the first solution that comes to mind. And yet there\u2019s very little research, almost none, that suggests that there\u2019s any kind of quality and time association, meaning the best ideas don\u2019t come first."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"In fact, there\u2019s a fascinating piece of research called the \u201ccreative cliff illusion,\u201d where the researchers demonstrated that the typical person, they have this expectation that your creativity will precipitously decline at some point. It\u2019s a cliff. The reason they call it the \u201cillusion,\u201d though, is because it\u2019s actually not true. Your creativity doesn\u2019t decline \u2014 hardly at all, let alone precipitously. And in fact, there are some people for whom there\u2019s actually a creative ramp, where creativity increases over time. You know who those people are?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Tell me."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"They\u2019re the people who expect they\u2019ll keep having good ideas."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Aah. So the mindset of expect\u2014 \u2026 Okay, I\u2019m seeing how you\u2019re building your answer. So what is that mindset that helps us create more and more ideas and not be blinded by the first one that pops into our head?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Exactly. It\u2019s shifting orientation, and that\u2019s really at the heart of idea flow. The human tendency is to fixate on the right answer, and very few problems we face in business or in life have a single right answer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"It\u2019s not like math. And by the way, even in advanced math, there\u2019s no single right answer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right, right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"It blows your mind."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"But most people think: \u201cCan I just look in the back of the textbook and see: Did I get it right?\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And that\u2019s the wrong way to approach \u2026 What the subject line of this email should be, there\u2019s no right answer. How I open this presentation, there\u2019s no right answer. How I give this piece of feedback, there\u2019s no \u2026"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So forget even new products and new services. If you think about the problems most managers or professionals face, they\u2019re problems of \u201cI\u2019m trying to solve this thing right now.\u201d And if they\u2019re aware that their tendency is to fixate on the answer, if they shift their mindsets and say, \u201cInstead of trying to come up with the right answer, I\u2019m going to try to generate as many as I can possibly think of,\u201d that actually has \u2014 it\u2019s called what Luchins referred to as an \u201cinterrupt effect.\u201d It interrupts your cognitive tendency to fixate on a first idea, but the important thing is you\u2019re actually shifting the goal posts. You\u2019re saying: \u201cInstead of looking for the right answer, I\u2019m trying to generate as many possible answers as I can.\u201d"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And we codify that in the book in a practice that we call the \u201cDaily Idea Quota\u201d where we say every day articulate one problem for which you\u2019re trying to find the right answer, and just shift your mindset and say: \u201cI\u2019m going to come up with 10.\u201d And 10 is somewhat arbitrary in the sense that it could be 100 or it could be 20, but it\u2019s \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But it\u2019s more than one."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"It\u2019s more than one, and it\u2019s enough that people kind of run out of steam. Maybe they have one or two or three; but then they\u2019ve got to force themselves to think beyond their current consideration set, and that\u2019s where the interesting stuff happens. And so it\u2019s really that shift in goal that we\u2019re advocating as kind of a fundamental capacity-building \u2026"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Whether you solve the problem or not, what you have to know is what you\u2019re doing with the Daily Idea Quota is you\u2019re retraining your tendency to fixate on the first thing you think of. And if you solve the problem? Great. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re building the muscle. And that\u2019s the important thing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. So you\u2019re training your brain to fight a cognitive habit that we have."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Exactly. It\u2019s about practice. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever read the klutz guide to juggling?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Oh, yeah. That\u2019s \u2014 yeah."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Okay. So John Cassidy, he\u2019s one of the instructors at the d.school. I know him well. He wrote the klutz guide. The whole first chapter of the klutz guide \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah, [crosstalk]."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u2014 you throw the ball in the air, and you let it hit the ground. Whole first chapter. You do it hundreds of times. And I asked Cass: \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d \u201cPeople have to be desensitized to the ball hitting the ground.\u201d You can never learn how to juggle if you\u2019re not comfortable with the ball hitting the ground, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Nice."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"There\u2019s something of that function being performed by a Daily Idea Quota. The cost of writing down a bad idea is basically zero. The potential benefit of allowing your brain to increase in variation is enormous. The world doesn\u2019t end if I write down a dopey idea."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"You know what I do? I throw the Post-It away. Doesn\u2019t matter. But do I allow myself to entertain dopey enough to be brilliant? That\u2019s really the question."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s fantastic. You took me back to one of my favorite movies, The Karate Kid, and the repetition, over and over again, to get used to that."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s great. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m such a lousy juggler: I never practiced dropping the ball so much."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"You\u2019ve got to do it, right? You\u2019ve got to do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And it costs nothing."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"That\u2019s the thing, except your cringe sense of \u201cOh, I failed again.\u201d As long as you think failure is a bad thing, or a bad idea is a bad thing, you\u2019re not going to do it. But if you realize it\u2019s a necessary input to an innovation process or a funnel, then you embrace it as much as you embrace the good stuff."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Do you have further ideas and practices for generating ideas? I like the daily list. That\u2019s great."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Are there other things that we can do to help strengthen that muscle to make ourselves more comfortable with idea generation?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah, a couple things come to mind. One is: Be thoughtful about inputs."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Whenever we think about creativity and innovation, everybody is consumed with output: What happens?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"What designers know and what the d.school does such a good job of emphasizing is input matters. The inputs to your thinking drive the outputs of your thinking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So if you\u2019re exposing yourself to the same inputs, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re getting the same output. If you\u2019re trying to increase the variability of the output, then a simple question to ask is: Where could I go to learn something new? And there are tons of tools in the book, tons of tools we teach. A couple of simple examples I\u2019ll give you. One is what we call a \u201cwonder wander.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"A wonder wander."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Okay? So you take a problem in mind or take a problem in hand, and you walk a city block."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And as you walk the city block, you look and you see an Adidas store, and you say: \u201cHow would Adidas deal with this?\u201d You see a UPS truck drive by. How would UPS do this? You see a children\u2019s playground. What does a playground have \u2026 You almost impute or project a sense of divine inspiration on everything you see. And what are you doing there? You\u2019re entertaining new connections. So fundamentally, what is an idea? An idea is a connection. That\u2019s it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"The brain doesn\u2019t make new material from nothing. There\u2019s no such thing as ex nihilo creation in human beings, okay? Doesn\u2019t exist."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"What the brain does is it takes things we know and it snaps them together. So that\u2019s the heart of a wonder wander. The other tactic I\u2019d mention is: Change your collaborators. If you picture your wonder wander as you\u2019re going about the block and you\u2019re gathering Legos and you\u2019re putting them in your bag \u2014 well, when you change collaborators, that new collaborator brings a new bag of Legos. And all of a sudden, I can try my Legos on with yours if the context is right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And so thinking about, being thoughtful about \u201cWho am I collaborating with? Who am I interacting with?\u201d If it\u2019s the same people, the same team doing the same thing, shocker if we keep saying the same ideas. And you look across history, see fantastic examples. I think about Ben Franklin, who, every single week for 30 years, met with the \u201cJunto\u201d he called it, which was a group of leather-aproned individuals from other organizations who would sit down in Philadelphia, and they would say on a regular weekly basis: \u201cHas anybody moved here that we ought to know? Has anybody\u2019s business failed? And why is that? Are there any scientific advances that would be relevant to our businesses?\u201d"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"For 30 years, they met every week. And you wonder: How did Franklin come up with the lightning rod and map the Gulf Stream, and the Continental Congress and fire departments? It\u2019s because his portfolio of collaborators was so broad."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And one of the things especially in this hyper-efficient moment we are in in [the] professional world: We don\u2019t have time to go for a walk. We don\u2019t have time to meet with people. Unless it\u2019s clearly and directly related to the thing I\u2019m working on right now, we\u2019re not interested in more Legos. And then what we do is we sit around and go: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have any new ideas?\u201d Well, you\u2019ve been pushing all the other Lego piles away."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love your example of Legos. I am a big fan of not only Lego bricks themselves but the company \u2014"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Oh!"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 and how they do what they do, especially around communication. I was introduced to you through a mutual friend, Brendan Boyle, who heads up IDEO\u2019s Play Lab."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Love Brendan."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And he shared two additional techniques that I\u2019d love just to get your opinion on for generating ideas. One is just a mash-up, where you just generate different ideas and then see what happens when you combine them together."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So think of animals, and then think of furniture, and what happens if you were to combine those and see. And then the other thing he shared with me which I get very excited about is thinking through analogies."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yes. Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And he shares this wonderful story that I love, and I\u2019m wondering if you know the story, as well. Some hospital was looking to make itself more efficient \u2014 it\u2019s ER rooms, emergency rooms, more efficient. And rather than going to other hospitals to see what they do, they went to a Formula One pit crew and saw: \u201cWhat does a pit crew do?\u201d"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah. Yeah. Right."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And they noticed lots of things, like they kit things together, and people have specific jobs and they stay in specific places. And it had a dramatic impact on the ideas they generate."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah. Yeah. What the research suggests is the more distant the analogy, the more breakthrough the results. Arthur Koestler, who\u2019s a philosopher and author who wrote a fantastic book called The Act of Creation \u2014 800-page tome on creativity \u2014 one of the things he said: He defined creativity as the collision of apparently unrelated frames of reference."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And so if you think about \u201capparently unrelated\u201d being \u2026 Obviously, \u201ccollision\u201d being the active verb there. But \u201capparently unrelated,\u201d right? What does NASCAR have to do with a hospital? It actually has everything to do with it. And if you only think about superficial characteristics of an analogy, you\u2019re stuck going to: What about nursing homes? And what about birthing centers? It\u2019s all because you\u2019re thinking health care, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"But if you start thinking about the deeper characteristics of the problem to be solved, this is about fast turns. Why don\u2019t we go to Southwest Airlines? Maybe we could learn there. Right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"This is about getting somebody in and out as quickly as possible. Well, let\u2019s not go to the DMV. Whatever the case may be. So thinking about the characteristics of your problem often yields \u2026 And the research suggests when analogies were imposed that are farther afield than folks expect, the ideas were much more creative \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u2014 than analogies that were kind of typical and standard."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think many people who resonate with what you\u2019re saying and can see the value in it are confronted with bosses or infrastructure that aren\u2019t about that. How do you convince, persuade, cajole, prove that these ideas that you\u2019re talking about can actually make a big difference for somebody who\u2019s not of that mindset?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah, you\u2019re right: that the environment determines a lot of your success. So there\u2019s a couple of things here. One is the environment matters. And if you look at, for example, educational interventions, the single greatest variable that affects the success of the educated is the context into which they are sent."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So you can teach somebody anything fascinating. If they go into a context [that\u2019s] hostile to it, they will revert back to average behavior. As a kind of playful aside: In the context of marriage, what I\u2019ve noticed is \u2014 you know, respectfully, my wife will say: \u201cHey, we\u2019re not at the d.school right now. We\u2019ve got to decide what we\u2019re having for dinner,\u201d and, \u201cI don\u2019t want to brainstorm.\u201d Right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So you\u2019ve got to be willing to say: \u201cIt takes two to tango, and sometimes we don\u2019t have to tango. We\u2019re just going to go to Chipotle. It\u2019s cool.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right. Right, right, right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Inaction is often rewarded in organizations, and in innovative organizations, inaction is punished. Doing nothing is not okay. The telltale sign that inaction is valued is, at the end of a meeting, what happens. In many organizations, there is a resolution to have another meeting."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this next week.\u201d What does that mean? We\u2019re not taking action. And so what innovative leaders do is they end the meeting by saying: \u201cWhat data do we need between now and the next meeting? And who\u2019s going to create it? And how are you doing it?\u201d They establish ownership. They establish accountability. If we don\u2019t have new information, we\u2019re not going to have a new conversation. The innovative leader is the one who has an instinct to go get new information before the next conversation."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to turn our focus very specifically to communication. You are a master communicator \u2014 our audience is hearing that \u2014 and you\u2019re great at telling stories. What advice do you have for listeners to help them communicate in general better, but communicate creative ideas better?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"A couple things come to mind. One is I think communication is ultimately about energy transfer. You\u2019re trying to get your audience and recipient to feel the same degree or be energized to the same extent you are."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"So if you take that as the premise, then the question is: Do I feel energy about this? I cannot transfer what I don\u2019t possess. If I want to transfer energy, then I\u2019ve got to find what\u2019s invigorating to me about this. So tapping into your own authentic motivation is critical. And I would say the reason for a lot of failures in innovation in industry is nobody actually really cares. There\u2019s not that fundamental care. So that\u2019s one thing. In terms of communicating creative ideas, you have to start with: Why? It\u2019s Simon Sinek, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"But a lot of times, we start with the user in the d.school, the human being who is affected. I do not, by the way, believe that that\u2019s the only way to come up with new ideas. We often say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start with somebody other than yourself,\u201d and yet history is littered with examples of people who designed for themselves, and it worked really well. So I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s always got to be about the user."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"But you do have to start with emotion, is the one thing I would say, and the tendency in business is to be sterile in our communication. We want only the facts. And so for a lot of people, when they\u2019re communicating a creative idea, they talk about what\u2019s new. They talk about the technology. But if you don\u2019t talk about the emotional reason for being, the emotional impact that it\u2019s going to have on a human being, you\u2019re going to fail to rally that engagement from your audience, and you\u2019re going to fail to transfer energy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love that notion of transferring energy, and I find \u2026 I absolutely resonate that emotion is critical in communication, and in the work I do with my students and the people I coach who are technologists or scientists, they often bristle at this notion of emotion because it\u2019s about bits and bytes. And in fact, I help them shift by simply saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re saving trees, saving lives, saving money, saving energy, you\u2019re actually doing something emotional\u201d \u2014"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 and, \u201cTap into that first as a way.\u201d"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Absolutely."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And I hear what you\u2019re saying echoes that, as well. I want to turn now to your Masters of Creativity Web series."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ve had a lot of fun watching it."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Thanks."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And I\u2019ve learned a ton."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Thanks."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious to hear from you if you could share one or two of your favorite lessons from the show you do."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"[From my] memory banks. I think one of the most fascinating examples that I\u2019ve heard is Leidy Klotz. He\u2019s a professor at the University of Virginia, and he talks about how the human tendency \u2014 when we\u2019re trying to make an improvement, we have a tendency to add. And what his research \u2026 And he had a landmark cover story on Nature, the scientific journal \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u2014 the same week that his book was published on the same topic, which was this idea of subtraction. Many times, the most elegant solution is to actually remove something, not to add something. And yet our tendency is always to add. That, to me, has profound implications for a lot of innovation efforts."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Sure, bring it on."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"\u201cShow Me Your Soul.\u201d I was impacted by that line. The creative director of the d.school, Scott Doorley, in an impassioned moment at a critical juncture in our organization\u2019s history, made a plea for more soulful work. And it often comes to mind. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve gotten it right, verbatim, but that\u2019s what I took away from it, was \u2026"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"And to me, it\u2019s this sense of care. Do you even care about this? And I really feel that\u2019s integral, as I said earlier, to communication: that sense of \u2026 That\u2019s the nuclear reactor at the center. That has the \u2026 Not to make a political statement. All I mean is that\u2019s what will generate incomparable energy is that sense of soul, that sense of care."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Very powerful and very evocative, the analogy you used. Question 2: Who is a communicator that you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"My dad, definitely. He has a masterful way of getting folks to stay engaged. He was a preacher when I was growing up. That\u2019s a preacher\u2019s job \u2014 if folks are falling asleep in the pews, you\u2019re in trouble, although that happens a lot, unfortunately. But he\u2019s since moved on to other professions."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"But everybody has got a repertoire of stories, my dad included. Always he\u2019s adding new stories to the repertoire, obviously. But one of the things I\u2019ve realized is he\u2019ll be telling a story, and I know that I know it already, but I don\u2019t interrupt him because I\u2019m trying to figure out: What is the arc here that makes people lean in? And I feel like I\u2019ve learned, even subconsciously, a lot of my own storytelling technique from how he taught me almost in more of an apprenticeship model."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think it\u2019s wonderful that you admire your father and his storytelling. All parents should strive to have their kids admire something about them."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Yeah."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But what I find fascinating is that you\u2019re actually looking at the technique structure of the story, as well. That\u2019s important, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked a lot about on this show. Let me ask Question 3: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"What, when, and why."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"I think being simple. But to me, if you\u2019re going to be successful, you\u2019re \u2014 hopefully at the end the day you want to change something in terms of action or behavior. I think that\u2019s communication. It is hopefully to change something. So if it\u2019s in the bowl of action, so to speak, then: What is the change? When does it have to happen? And why do I want it to happen? It may be a little bit of a superficial answer, but to me, it\u2019s \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s superficial at all. I think that\u2019s actually really insightful. The piece there that we have not heard in any way, shape, or form is the \u201cwhen\u201d piece. Things happen on a timeline with a sense of urgency or not, and you need to factor that in. I appreciate you adding that to our catalog of things to be thinking about when we create our communication recipes. Well, Jeremy, it has been a true pleasure."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Awesome."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I appreciate you bringing your full soul and energy to this conversation. Everybody listening, take lots of ideas away for how they can be more creative."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"I hope so."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And certainly I had a lot of fun, and this dialogue continues the many that we\u2019ve had in the past. Thank you so much, and I wish you best of luck not only on your show but also on your new book."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"Thank you."},{"author":"Jeremy Utley","text":"[Music plays]"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.
