I mean in podcast mode, I may not be able to see my audience, but usually when I\u2019m dealing with contentious information my audience is probably going to be in the room or maybe on the video conference. Observing their behavior is a first step. If you see them starting to clamp up or make some manifestation of frustration, lack of clarity, even anger, that\u2019s a signal that something you just said created that reaction. So now you know at what point you got into the contentious content of your discussion. That\u2019s a key clue to how you\u2019re going to respond to that. So it\u2019s always important to observe your audience\u2019s body language in anticipation of these moments"},{"author":"Burt Alper","text":"Your own body language in response to that is critical as well. It\u2019s not just your body, but your voice: You don\u2019t want to fight fire with fire. If they start to raise their voice, you raising your voice to match that is not likely to lead to a happy ending. If you can remain calm, and then keep the emotional tension out of your voice, as hard as that is, it does create an interesting opportunity to diffuse. Your body language needs to go along with that, starting with what you\u2019re doing when they\u2019re raising the objection. You want to be an active listener, you want to communicate all of the signals that suggest you have a sincere interest in the concern they have and you\u2019re not going to whitewash over it. It\u2019s important that they feel heard and you want everything in your body to suggest you\u2019re listening attentively to them. That means don\u2019t get your phone out while they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t look at somebody else, certainly don\u2019t roll your eyes.

Having a strong lower body with an active and open upper body shows that you\u2019re not wilting under the pressure, but you\u2019re also being open and vulnerable. You\u2019re willing to hear the push back.

In our small studio here I\u2019m enjoying the fact that I can make eye contact with you, in a larger audience it is still critical to make sustained eye contact during your delivery of the information and while the skepticism is being expressed. Humanity appreciates eye contact. We trust eye contact. It is one of the things that if you change that element of your communication style, it tends to have a huge impact on people\u2019s perception of your trustworthiness and of your stability and confidence. So being able to hold eye contact if someone is challenging you, very powerful position in that conversation, and then being able to maintain that eye contact as you deal with the response also shows that you\u2019ve got good conviction in your ideas."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, produced by Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business.
