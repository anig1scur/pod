I\u2019m Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast. Today I am super excited to chat with Celine Teoh. Celine is a facilitator of the GSB\u2019s famous Interpersonal Dynamics course. She\u2019s a CEO coach and a GSB graduate. Welcome, Celine. I so look forward to our conversation."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I\u2019m looking forward to this as well, Matt. I\u2019m excited."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Excellent. Well, let\u2019s go ahead and get started. I\u2019d like to start with the Interpersonal Dynamics course that you help facilitate. It\u2019s also known as \u201cTouchy-Feely,\u201d and you and others help run that course. Can you remind our listeners what the course is about, how it works, and share maybe two key takeaways from it?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Of course. Interpersonal Dynamics is the most popular elective at the Stanford GSB. It\u2019s really about teaching people how to be effective interpersonal communicators and how to do so both at work as well as in their personal lives. How it works: Well, one example I can bring to you is when I was a student in MBA at the GSB, one exercise that we ran in \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d is notorious, and it\u2019s known as the Influence Line where other students have to rank you according to how influential you are to them. And consistently, I wound up in the bottom half of everyone\u2019s Influence Line."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"And I was devastated. Here I was, a new immigrant to the United States, female, Asian, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was at the bottom of the influence line. So I felt sad. I felt disappointed in myself. I felt hard done by, resentful. And normally, what I would do would be to disengage and say, you know what, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m influential, I\u2019m stepping out. But what\u2019s great about this course is it encourages you to reengage. And so I dug into the feedback, got insights from other people as to why I was coming across that way and, as a result, changed the way I behave when I\u2019m in American contexts."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"What\u2019s great about that is I diversify the range of behaviors that I bring to bear. So when I\u2019m in the States, I come across a little bit more emotion and more animation. And when I\u2019m in Asia, I can come across with less amplitude. And I have this range of behaviors now I can pick and choose from, and I have agency. So that\u2019s what Interpersonal Dynamics does."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It\u2019s a phenomenal course. And one of the strengths, I think, of the course is that it really helps people, as you shared in your story, to really learn about themselves and to learn about themselves in a very direct way \u2014 not mean, but to learn about themselves, and then, as you said, to develop a sense of agency to make those changes that are needed. And thank you for sharing that. In all of our interactions, you are certainly influential in my book. You would be at the top of my lines. So thank you for that."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Thank you, Matt."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019d love for you to share how all of us can be a little bit more touchy-feely, if you will, when we work in organizations or corporate cultures that emphasize logic in action. What can we do to be more empathetic and connected to those environments?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"One of the things I will say is I\u2019ll repeat advice that David Bradford, one of the key developers of the \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d course, told me when I was actually Chair of the Stanford Alumni Consulting Team. I asked him, \u201cDavid, how do you bring \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d to organizations?\u201d And he said, \u201cStealth it in with a check-in.\u201d"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"And this is how you do it: You go around the room in any meeting, and everybody says one feeling word, how are you feeling today, and one sentence as to why. The reason why you do that is because it creates the space for someone to say, \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on with me outside work.\u201d And what happens is you no longer have the sales team talking to the marketing team. No, you have a parent talking to another parent, or you have a caregiver talking to another caregiver. You have more hooks, more chances for people to connect with each other. When I do my work as a CEO coach with startups, a lot of the CEOs tell me, \u201cCeline, that\u2019ll take too long.\u201d But honestly, five minutes \u2014 I guarantee you, five minutes is all it takes."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"And then on top of that, many of them will tell me, \u201cCeline, I can\u2019t say the word feelings in my organization. We\u2019re a bunch of coders.\u201d"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"\u201cThat word is not okay.\u201d And what I tell them is, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t say feelings. Instead, use a prompt like, what was one good thing that happened to you today? What was one bad thing that happened to you today? What\u2019s keeping you up at night?\u201d And then over time, you can slowly, slowly increase the vulnerability and the range of emotions that you\u2019re allowing people to bring in."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love the advice, and thank you again for the specific examples about how we can start with something as simple as just begin by checking in with each other. And in fact, doing so can warm people up and get the conversation going, and it doesn\u2019t always have to be about an emotion. And I loved what you said about how it changes our relationship, so I\u2019m no longer my functional role talking to your functional role; we\u2019re two people communicating. And that immediacy and connection I can see brings a lot of value."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Are there other bits of advice that you have or experiences you have as a facilitator of Interpersonal Dynamics or in your own private practice that can really help connect people together? Are there things we can do or say that can help with that?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I think there are two things I would recommend. One is to be very clear about what you\u2019re feeling because feelings are data. And in the rest of our logical lives, we would never make decisions on bad or highly abstract data, but we\u2019ll do that with feelings. We\u2019ll just say, \u201cI\u2019m feeling sad, Matt, or glad.\u201d But that\u2019s not detailed enough."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"So what I like to recommend is for people to actually take a page from Carol Robin\u2019s book, \u201cConnect.\u201d In the back of that appendix, you\u2019ll actually see a feelings chart. Carry that feelings chart around and check in at the beginning of meetings, at the end of meetings, and say, how am I feeling right now at a granular level? As an example, before our chat today, I\u2019ve listened to this podcast since the very beginning."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Uh-huh. Thank you."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I love it. And so as a result, before I came in today, I was excited. I was glad. I was anticipatory. But I was also nervous. And so what did I do with that? I decided I would go for a walk, get some of those nerves out. I would practice my vocal exercises."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"And then I decided to reframe \u2014 you and I will have a wonderful conversation. And I think it makes for just a much more fun interaction than if I were just I\u2019m just nervous."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Ah, absolutely. So certainly, no need to be nervous here. And I too was very much looking forward to this. So again, I hear the advice, much like you give to our students, is you really have to reflect on yourself, where you are, and take that as information, input, and data from which you can then act. And I think you\u2019re exactly right \u2014 in thinking about my own life, when I look at my emotional state, I\u2019ll just label it. I won\u2019t actually go much deeper. And I think that\u2019s really important because then you can take action. If I just say I\u2019m nervous, but if I think more about that nervousness and how I can address it, then I can do something about it. So I like how the reflection leads to data that can lead to action."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Exactly."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Very helpful, very helpful. I\u2019d love to get your thoughts and advice on how do you manage challenges and issues and disagreement at work when you\u2019re confrontational rather than collaborative."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Mm. I would say it\u2019s all about empathy."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Conflict is magnetic. It draws attention. And whenever we encounter conflict, our attention tends to go to this narrow focus point that is the conflict alone. I like to encourage my clients to expand their perspective and think about the relationship as a whole as a container, and then go to Gottman\u2019s research, that we also reference in Interpersonal Dynamics. Gottman found out that there\u2019s a five-to-one magic ratio of positive interactions to negative interactions in successful relationships."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"So my advice is build your emotional piggybank by depositing those five good interactions in before you have the conflict. Build that, and then even in the conflict, continue depositing those positive interactions in as a way of making sure that your conflicts go well because you\u2019re demonstrating good intent. You\u2019re demonstrating that the relationship\u2019s important to you. And these positive interactions can be really small. They could be a smile, an eye meet. They could be a pat on the shoulder. They could be a nod of the head. It\u2019s easy. But we forget. I forget."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes. I certainly am familiar with Gottman\u2019s work and this notion of storing up positive interaction. And I see this in my interactions with my kids. There\u2019s a lot that I try to actively acknowledge the successes. As a parent, it can be very easy to focus on the things you\u2019d like to change or advice you\u2019d like to give. So I consciously try when positive accolades or praise are appropriate to give that, knowing not only that it will help in the moment, but it might help me in those times where I have to give negative feedback or have a conflictual situation."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"That\u2019s huge, Matt. I love that you\u2019re doing this with your family. And even at work, we have Slack channels called Celebration \u2014 where people are encouraged to drop in and just celebrate somebody else for something they did. Or at the end of meetings, we will actually have breakout rooms where we\u2019ll put two people in together and celebrate each other and \u2014"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s really fabulous how that can help people. And I begin to think back to when you talked about ways to bring empathy and feeling into organizations with a check-in at the beginning. Some kind of gratitude or celebration at the ending might be a really nice way to round out an interaction or a meeting."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"They\u2019re nice bookends."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s right. That\u2019s perfect. For those of our listeners who are looking to enhance or hone their empathy, feedback, and communication skills, what advice and guidance would you give them based on your experience?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I would recommend asking. So the reason I say that is all of us here sitting in Silicon Valley, business types, we tend to have advice monsters. We like to give advice. And what I\u2019d encourage people to do instead is to ask, \u201cDo you need support or advice right now?\u201d And you\u2019d be surprised the number of times people say, \u201cI actually know what I need to do. I don\u2019t need your advice. I just want someone to commiserate [laughs] with me.\u201d"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"So do that, ask first. We assume people need advice, but that\u2019s not necessarily always the case. And the support component gives us a chance to connect with the other person."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah, totally get it. My wife and I have a lot of conversations around this issue. As a professor, as somebody giving advice, it\u2019s something that I do as a reflex. And listening and understanding if support is needed is really important. I actually think \u2014 and this is a little bit true for myself \u2014 that giving advice is a way to hide behind \u2014 you hide behind the advice so you don\u2019t actually have to connect and engage. And I\u2019m wondering if you find that to be true and have any advice on how to have that confidence to be vulnerable to \u201cI\u2019m here to support you, but I don\u2019t quite know how to do that\u201d or what\u2019s needed in the moment. It\u2019s much easier for me to say, \u201cOh, just go do this.\u201d"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Yes, of course. Before I answer that question, I\u2019ll actually agree with you on that and also say that advice giving is distancing because it puts us in a position of superiority."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"True."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"It assumes that we know the answer and, \u201cHey, Matt, I can fix you. Just do this.\u201d You know, it\u2019s distancing. And so my recommendation is actually to tiptoe into it by sometimes even just knowing that phrase, \u201cDo you want support or advice right now?\u201d just practicing that, because once you can say that, the response \u2014 your response depends on what the other person says, and they will guide you as to what they need. So just ask."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think putting yourself in a place where you can just be receptive is hard but very useful and have seen that play out very successfully many times in my life. So thank you for that. So Celine, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. Are you up for that?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Yes."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"All right. Excellent. So question number one: If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"It would be people will remember how you made them feel. That\u2019s by Maya Angelou."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. Tell me more about why that\u2019s so important for you."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Because it\u2019s not about the words. It\u2019s about how people feel inside. That\u2019s how you persuade. That\u2019s how you connect. That\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re emotional beings."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that\u2019s exactly right. And we need to think about how we impact people on an emotional level. I think we do a disservice when we think about our communication as only information transfer. It is clearly emotion transfer as well \u2014"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Mm-hmm."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 and we need to bring those two into balance. And that quote is very helpful to remind us of that."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I love that phrase \u2014 emotional transfer."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"There you go. Question number two: Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I think Steve Jobs comes to mind. You know, he used passion, simplicity, storytelling to be memorable. And so much emotion."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Absolutely. And the thing I like about Steve Jobs in terms of his communication is he worked really hard on it. He was very good at it, had lots of natural talent. But he worked hard, tirelessly, to improve and hone. And he also made sure to focus the message in a very concise, clear, audience-centric way. So I agree. Lots of good things to learn there."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Mm. So much hard work underpinning what looked effortless."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Isn\u2019t that amazing how \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a great lesson for all of us to remember is that practice and preparation can make things easier and look easier. Question number three: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I think listening to understand, finding commonality, and connecting through feelings."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So connecting through feelings I see absolutely from what we\u2019ve talked about. Talk to me about listening to understand."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"I think that\u2019s bound up with empathy \u2014 right? You can\u2019t really communicate if you don\u2019t understand what it is your audience is looking for, what your counterpart is looking for, what they care about. We focus too much on ourselves."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yeah. And I feel like people, and myself included when I listen, I\u2019m listening for the hooks that give me what I want to say next or help me get to the next place and not necessarily reflecting on what this means for the other person and potentially for this relationship, interaction, et cetera. So I like that idea of listening to understand."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Yeah. It\u2019s part \u2014 it ties back to what you said about practice. Conceptually, it\u2019s an easy concept, but it\u2019s really hard to do because you have to let go so much of your own agenda."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you have to quiet your mind and really be present. And for a lot of us, that\u2019s hard. Celine, thank you so much. This was a true pleasure to chat with you. This notion of really respecting our feelings and embracing them and looking at ways to really understand ourselves so that we can bring our more whole self and emotional self to our interactions and our communication is absolutely important. So thank you for the lessons. Thank you for your time. And thank you for sharing important information with all of us."},{"author":"Celine Teoh","text":"Thank you, Matt. The pleasure was all mine."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast, from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

I\u2019m excited."]},{"begin":"43.600","end":"62.080","lines":["Excellent. Well, let\u2019s go ahead and get started. I\u2019d like to start with the Interpersonal Dynamics course that you help facilitate. It\u2019s also known as \u201cTouchy-Feely,\u201d and you and others help run that course. Can you remind our listeners what the course is about, how it works, and share maybe two key takeaways from it?"]},{"begin":"62.080","end":"104.640","lines":["Of course. Interpersonal Dynamics is the most popular elective at the Stanford GSB. It\u2019s really about teaching people how to be effective interpersonal communicators and how to do so both at work as well as in their personal lives. How it works: Well, one example I can bring to you is when I was a student in MBA at the GSB, one exercise that we ran in \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d is notorious, and it\u2019s known as the Influence Line where other students have to rank you according to how influential you are to them. And consistently, I wound up in the bottom half of everyone\u2019s Influence Line."]},{"begin":"104.640","end":"150.960","lines":["And I was devastated. Here I was, a new immigrant to the United States, female, Asian, and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was at the bottom of the influence line. So I felt sad. I felt disappointed in myself. I felt hard done by, resentful. And normally, what I would do would be to disengage and say, you know what, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m influential, I\u2019m stepping out. But what\u2019s great about this course is it encourages you to reengage. And so I dug into the feedback, got insights from other people as to why I was coming across that way and, as a result, changed the way I behave when I\u2019m in American contexts."]},{"begin":"150.960","end":"174.440","lines":["What\u2019s great about that is I diversify the range of behaviors that I bring to bear. So when I\u2019m in the States, I come across a little bit more emotion and more animation. And when I\u2019m in Asia, I can come across with less amplitude. And I have this range of behaviors now I can pick and choose from, and I have agency. So that\u2019s what Interpersonal Dynamics does."]},{"begin":"174.440","end":"201.040","lines":["It\u2019s a phenomenal course. And one of the strengths, I think, of the course is that it really helps people, as you shared in your story, to really learn about themselves and to learn about themselves in a very direct way \u2014 not mean, but to learn about themselves, and then, as you said, to develop a sense of agency to make those changes that are needed. And thank you for sharing that. In all of our interactions, you are certainly influential in my book. You would be at the top of my lines.

What can we do to be more empathetic and connected to those environments?"]},{"begin":"218.760","end":"239.920","lines":["One of the things I will say is I\u2019ll repeat advice that David Bradford, one of the key developers of the \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d course, told me when I was actually Chair of the Stanford Alumni Consulting Team. I asked him, \u201cDavid, how do you bring \u201cTouchy-Feely\u201d to organizations?\u201d And he said, \u201cStealth it in with a check-in.\u201d"]},{"begin":"239.920","end":"287.800","lines":["And this is how you do it: You go around the room in any meeting, and everybody says one feeling word, how are you feeling today, and one sentence as to why. The reason why you do that is because it creates the space for someone to say, \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on with me outside work.\u201d And what happens is you no longer have the sales team talking to the marketing team. No, you have a parent talking to another parent, or you have a caregiver talking to another caregiver. You have more hooks, more chances for people to connect with each other. When I do my work as a CEO coach with startups, a lot of the CEOs tell me, \u201cCeline, that\u2019ll take too long.\u201d But honestly, five minutes \u2014 I guarantee you, five minutes is all it takes."]},{"begin":"287.800","end":"296.080","lines":["And then on top of that, many of them will tell me, \u201cCeline, I can\u2019t say the word feelings in my organization.

Instead, use a prompt like, what was one good thing that happened to you today? What was one bad thing that happened to you today? What\u2019s keeping you up at night?\u201d And then over time, you can slowly, slowly increase the vulnerability and the range of emotions that you\u2019re allowing people to bring in."]},{"begin":"320.760","end":"348.600","lines":["I love the advice, and thank you again for the specific examples about how we can start with something as simple as just begin by checking in with each other. And in fact, doing so can warm people up and get the conversation going, and it doesn\u2019t always have to be about an emotion. And I loved what you said about how it changes our relationship, so I\u2019m no longer my functional role talking to your functional role; we\u2019re two people communicating. And that immediacy and connection I can see brings a lot of value."]},{"begin":"348.600","end":"363.080","lines":["Are there other bits of advice that you have or experiences you have as a facilitator of Interpersonal Dynamics or in your own private practice that can really help connect people together?

One is to be very clear about what you\u2019re feeling because feelings are data. And in the rest of our logical lives, we would never make decisions on bad or highly abstract data, but we\u2019ll do that with feelings. We\u2019ll just say, \u201cI\u2019m feeling sad, Matt, or glad.\u201d But that\u2019s not detailed enough."]},{"begin":"388.080","end":"414.000","lines":["So what I like to recommend is for people to actually take a page from Carol Robin\u2019s book, \u201cConnect.\u201d In the back of that appendix, you\u2019ll actually see a feelings chart. Carry that feelings chart around and check in at the beginning of meetings, at the end of meetings, and say, how am I feeling right now at a granular level? As an example, before our chat today, I\u2019ve listened to this podcast since the very beginning."]},{"begin":"414.000","end":"414.520","lines":["Uh-huh.

I would practice my vocal exercises."]},{"begin":"434.080","end":"446.120","lines":["And then I decided to reframe \u2014 you and I will have a wonderful conversation.

So certainly, no need to be nervous here. And I too was very much looking forward to this. So again, I hear the advice, much like you give to our students, is you really have to reflect on yourself, where you are, and take that as information, input, and data from which you can then act. And I think you\u2019re exactly right \u2014 in thinking about my own life, when I look at my emotional state, I\u2019ll just label it. I won\u2019t actually go much deeper. And I think that\u2019s really important because then you can take action. If I just say I\u2019m nervous, but if I think more about that nervousness and how I can address it, then I can do something about it. So I like how the reflection leads to data that can lead to action."]},{"begin":"489.560","end":"490.360","lines":["Exactly."]},{"begin":"490.360","end":"504.080","lines":["Very helpful, very helpful.

And whenever we encounter conflict, our attention tends to go to this narrow focus point that is the conflict alone. I like to encourage my clients to expand their perspective and think about the relationship as a whole as a container, and then go to Gottman\u2019s research, that we also reference in Interpersonal Dynamics. Gottman found out that there\u2019s a five-to-one magic ratio of positive interactions to negative interactions in successful relationships."]},{"begin":"543.040","end":"581.960","lines":["So my advice is build your emotional piggybank by depositing those five good interactions in before you have the conflict. Build that, and then even in the conflict, continue depositing those positive interactions in as a way of making sure that your conflicts go well because you\u2019re demonstrating good intent. You\u2019re demonstrating that the relationship\u2019s important to you. And these positive interactions can be really small. They could be a smile, an eye meet. They could be a pat on the shoulder. They could be a nod of the head. It\u2019s easy. But we forget. I forget."]},{"begin":"581.960","end":"621.120","lines":["Yes. I certainly am familiar with Gottman\u2019s work and this notion of storing up positive interaction. And I see this in my interactions with my kids. There\u2019s a lot that I try to actively acknowledge the successes. As a parent, it can be very easy to focus on the things you\u2019d like to change or advice you\u2019d like to give. So I consciously try when positive accolades or praise are appropriate to give that, knowing not only that it will help in the moment, but it might help me in those times where I have to give negative feedback or have a conflictual situation."]},{"begin":"621.120","end":"643.360","lines":["That\u2019s huge, Matt. I love that you\u2019re doing this with your family.

For those of our listeners who are looking to enhance or hone their empathy, feedback, and communication skills, what advice and guidance would you give them based on your experience?"]},{"begin":"677.120","end":"707.320","lines":["I would recommend asking. So the reason I say that is all of us here sitting in Silicon Valley, business types, we tend to have advice monsters. We like to give advice. And what I\u2019d encourage people to do instead is to ask, \u201cDo you need support or advice right now?\u201d And you\u2019d be surprised the number of times people say, \u201cI actually know what I need to do. I don\u2019t need your advice. I just want someone to commiserate [laughs] with me.\u201d"]},{"begin":"707.320","end":"717.240","lines":["So do that, ask first. We assume people need advice, but that\u2019s not necessarily always the case. And the support component gives us a chance to connect with the other person."]},{"begin":"717.240","end":"753.280","lines":["Yeah, totally get it. My wife and I have a lot of conversations around this issue. As a professor, as somebody giving advice, it\u2019s something that I do as a reflex. And listening and understanding if support is needed is really important. I actually think \u2014 and this is a little bit true for myself \u2014 that giving advice is a way to hide behind \u2014 you hide behind the advice so you don\u2019t actually have to connect and engage. And I\u2019m wondering if you find that to be true and have any advice on how to have that confidence to be vulnerable to \u201cI\u2019m here to support you, but I don\u2019t quite know how to do that\u201d or what\u2019s needed in the moment. It\u2019s much easier for me to say, \u201cOh, just go do this.\u201d"]},{"begin":"753.280","end":"764.120","lines":["Yes, of course. Before I answer that question, I\u2019ll actually agree with you on that and also say that advice giving is distancing because it puts us in a position of superiority."]},{"begin":"764.120","end":"764.600","lines":["True."]},{"begin":"764.600","end":"795.440","lines":["It assumes that we know the answer and, \u201cHey, Matt, I can fix you. Just do this.\u201d You know, it\u2019s distancing. And so my recommendation is actually to tiptoe into it by sometimes even just knowing that phrase, \u201cDo you want support or advice right now?\u201d just practicing that, because once you can say that, the response \u2014 your response depends on what the other person says, and they will guide you as to what they need. So just ask."]},{"begin":"795.440","end":"813.280","lines":["I think putting yourself in a place where you can just be receptive is hard but very useful and have seen that play out very successfully many times in my life. So thank you for that. So Celine, before we end, I\u2019d like to ask you the same three questions I ask everyone who joins me. Are you up for that?"]},{"begin":"813.280","end":"813.960","lines":["Yes."]},{"begin":"813.960","end":"827.640","lines":["All right. Excellent. So question number one: If you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"]},{"begin":"827.640","end":"833.120","lines":["It would be people will remember how you made them feel. That\u2019s by Maya Angelou."]},{"begin":"833.120","end":"836.600","lines":["Absolutely. Tell me more about why that\u2019s so important for you."]},{"begin":"836.600","end":"852.720","lines":["Because it\u2019s not about the words. It\u2019s about how people feel inside. That\u2019s how you persuade. That\u2019s how you connect. That\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re emotional beings."]},{"begin":"852.720","end":"866.080","lines":["I think that\u2019s exactly right. And we need to think about how we impact people on an emotional level. I think we do a disservice when we think about our communication as only information transfer. It is clearly emotion transfer as well \u2014"]},{"begin":"866.080","end":"866.440","lines":["Mm-hmm."]},{"begin":"866.440","end":"871.160","lines":["\u2014 and we need to bring those two into balance.

Question number two: Who is a communicator that you admire and why?"]},{"begin":"881.400","end":"892.400","lines":["I think Steve Jobs comes to mind. You know, he used passion, simplicity, storytelling to be memorable. And so much emotion."]},{"begin":"892.400","end":"912.840","lines":["Absolutely. And the thing I like about Steve Jobs in terms of his communication is he worked really hard on it. He was very good at it, had lots of natural talent. But he worked hard, tirelessly, to improve and hone. And he also made sure to focus the message in a very concise, clear, audience-centric way. So I agree. Lots of good things to learn there."]},{"begin":"912.840","end":"916.280","lines":["Mm. So much hard work underpinning what looked effortless."]},{"begin":"916.280","end":"934.320","lines":["Isn\u2019t that amazing how \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a great lesson for all of us to remember is that practice and preparation can make things easier and look easier. Question number three: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"]},{"begin":"934.320","end":"943.200","lines":["I think listening to understand, finding commonality, and connecting through feelings."]},{"begin":"943.200","end":"951.280","lines":["So connecting through feelings I see absolutely from what we\u2019ve talked about. Talk to me about listening to understand."]},{"begin":"951.280","end":"965.920","lines":["I think that\u2019s bound up with empathy \u2014 right? You can\u2019t really communicate if you don\u2019t understand what it is your audience is looking for, what your counterpart is looking for, what they care about. We focus too much on ourselves."]},{"begin":"965.920","end":"984.000","lines":["Yeah. And I feel like people, and myself included when I listen, I\u2019m listening for the hooks that give me what I want to say next or help me get to the next place and not necessarily reflecting on what this means for the other person and potentially for this relationship, interaction, et cetera. So I like that idea of listening to understand."]},{"begin":"984.000","end":"996.920","lines":["Yeah. It\u2019s part \u2014 it ties back to what you said about practice. Conceptually, it\u2019s an easy concept, but it\u2019s really hard to do because you have to let go so much of your own agenda."]},{"begin":"996.920","end":"1028.120","lines":["Mm-hmm. Yeah, you have to quiet your mind and really be present. And for a lot of us, that\u2019s hard. Celine, thank you so much. This was a true pleasure to chat with you. This notion of really respecting our feelings and embracing them and looking at ways to really understand ourselves so that we can bring our more whole self and emotional self to our interactions and our communication is absolutely important. So thank you for the lessons. Thank you for your time. And thank you for sharing important information with all of us."]},{"begin":"1028.120","end":"1030.080","lines":["Thank you, Matt.
