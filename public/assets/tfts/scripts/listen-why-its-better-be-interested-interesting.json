Mostly it\u2019s through conversation. Join me today as I have a conversation about conversations. My name is Matt Abrahams, and I teach strategic communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: The Podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I am super excited today to speak with Alison Wood Brooks. Alison is the O\u2019Brien associate professor of business administration and Hellman faculty fellow at Harvard Business School. Alison\u2019s research focuses on the science of conversation and interaction, and she teaches an award-winning course called TALK."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Welcome, Alison. I am so excited that we\u2019re actually getting to do this."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Hi, Matt. Thank you so much for reaching out to an East Coast friend. I\u2019m so happy to be here."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It is awesome, and I can\u2019t wait to get into our conversation, so let\u2019s go ahead and get started. I first came to know you and your work when I was writing my book, Speaking Up Without Freaking Out. I came across your research on reframing anxiety. I know it\u2019s from a long while back, but I\u2019d love to have you share this really helpful speaking anxiety management technique. You mind sharing?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Of course. I would love to. When I was in grad school, my dissertation was about anxiety, but what was new about my dissertation as a behavioral scientist was that everybody feels anxious, and not everybody needs therapy or medication or that level of treatment. What you really need are just sort of these smaller-scale coping strategies to help us deal with the very normal feelings of anxiety that we all feel a lot of the time. Matt, what makes you feel nervous? Does anything make you feel nervous?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No, I still get nervous. You know, Alison, it\u2019s funny. I get most nervous when I speak in front of folks like you, people who study communication, people who know what I know, know a lot more than I know. That\u2019s when I get nervous. Other times I\u2019ve learned to manage anxiety through techniques like you\u2019re going to introduce and others, but I still get nervous. How about you? Do you get nervous, too?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Oh my gosh. Totally. Yeah. I think we need to, actually. You put a compliment in there, so thank you. That was very nice. I think we\u2019re right to feel anxious, not only when we talk to people that we admire and we don\u2019t want to mess it up, but also anytime there\u2019s uncertainty and any sort of lack of control, which conversation is \u2014 that\u2019s sort of how it\u2019s built, right?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"We\u2019re co-constructing this interaction right now. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to say. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, and I can\u2019t possibly know, so that uncertainty is always there, and lack of control is there, because I can\u2019t control how you react to me or what you think of me. So, really, conversation is a very understandable place where you would feel anxious. There are lots of other tasks that make us feel anxious as well."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"We tried a very simple coping strategy, a very simple intervention, and the question was \u201cCan people reframe their anxious feelings as excitement?\u201d"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"It\u2019s a really simple idea, but the reason that it works is because, when we feel anxious, we have this crazy instinct that we should try and calm down, like really powerful. Everybody feels like they should calm down when they\u2019re anxious, and that\u2019s hard. That would require that we mitigate the physiological signs of anxiety, so your racing heart, sweaty palms, spiked cortisol in your body. You\u2019re trying to push those down, as well as move from the negative valence, like a negative emotion like anxiety, and move into the positive zone of calmness. That two-step move, reducing the physiological signals and moving from negative to positive \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much impossible. It\u2019s very, very hard, especially the physiological component of it. Instead, what reframing as excitement does is it allows you to stay in that high-arousal zone. You\u2019re not trying to combat your automatic physiological processes, but instead, you\u2019re just doing this mental reframe from negative to positive."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I love that it\u2019s so simple, and in fact, it really is. You just say, \u201cHey, these feelings I\u2019m having could represent excitement.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Then you can begin thinking about what is exciting in this opportunity. I\u2019m excited to share my information. I\u2019m excited to contribute to this conversation. That allows you to move away from fighting yourself to calm down, to not be nervous, and I have felt this very helpful for myself and in the students I teach and the people I coach. So I really appreciate not only you explaining it now, but for just doing the work originally."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Aw, thank you, Matt. I\u2019m excited to keep talking about it. Let\u2019s go."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No, it\u2019s great. Well, talking about TALK \u2014 you teach one of the most popular electives at Harvard\u2019s Business School, and it\u2019s called TALK. Can you tell us what the premise of your class is and highlight maybe one or two key takeaways."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yeah. I love teaching this course. TALK is an acronym. It\u2019s T-A-L-K, and it stands for Topics, Asking, Levity, and Kindness. What the course aspires to do is help people talk just a little bit better. I started out in the business school at Harvard teaching negotiation. I started to get a little frustrated. We have such a focus, both as scientists and in public discourse, on difficult conversations or so-called difficult conversations, and this conjures conversations like negotiations or delivering constructive feedback or giving hard advice or these things that we come to think of as difficult. What I\u2019ve realized through my life and teaching and through my research is that even easy conversations are difficult. We don\u2019t just suck at the hard ones. We suck at the easy ones, too."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"They can be so stressful."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yes. Yes. Once you delve into the complexity and the nuance that lives and breathes within each conversation, you start to see why it\u2019s hard, even when our goals align, even when our only goal is to have fun. Even that can be sort of hard, right?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"We might say the wrong thing. We don\u2019t know how other people are feeling, what they\u2019re thinking about. That\u2019s sort of the humble and extremely ambitious promise of the course. Let\u2019s make each conversation just a little bit better, but in accumulation over all the conversations of your life, that could make a massive difference for you and your career and for the people you love."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As you well know, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time recently talking about the spontaneous moments of communication, because a lot of what\u2019s taught in your institution, at my institution, is how to do formal, planned communicating, and this notion of most of what we do in business and our personal lives happens in the moment and happens in conversation, and I love that you are studying it. Anyone who\u2019s listened to this podcast knows that I\u2019m a huge fan of structure in communication. I think it can really help us in many ways. I know you think a lot about structure as well. Can you share your thoughts and research into structure of conversations and how we can better leverage this knowledge to improve those conversations?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yeah, of course. I would love to. When I heard the word structure, it triggers so very many ideas and thoughts for me that I actually wanted to turn this one around on you, Matt, and ask you, when you think of the word structure, especially in the context of communication, what types of things are you thinking about?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great question. For me, a structure is nothing more than a logical connection of ideas. It\u2019s a bridging of ideas, and not only is it the form that the communication takes, but it is the way you think about the communication. Having a structure helps solve one of the two fundamental problems I believe we have in communication: what to say and how to say it. The structure is how you say it, and then you can focus on just what is it you\u2019re saying. People call it story; people call it framework, but it\u2019s really the logical connection of ideas. In a conversation, from my perspective, structure is deployed in lots of different ways, and you\u2019re turn-taking within that structure as well. That\u2019s my perception. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your perception, and what does your research tell us about structure?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"That was such a great response. It really helped me to understand what you\u2019re thinking about. When I hear the word structure, I think there\u2019s three levels of things that I think about. The first is mechanics, and this gets down to the very basic, sort of fundamental \u201chow does a conversation unfold,\u201d so things like turn-taking and the very definition of what even is a conversation. How we define conversation in our very dry, academic sense is any exchange of verbal content between two or more people. It\u2019s the verbal \u2014 and by verbal, I mean there has to be language. There has to be words. They might be typed. They might be signed through sign language, but there has to be verbal content."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"So the mechanics in my mind are things like turn-taking. I speak, and then you speak, and then someone else speaks, and then I speak, and ideally, you try and avoid as much cross-talk and overlapping turns as possible. You can start to think about what\u2019s the time gap between turns. There\u2019s amazing research showing that shorter pauses between turns, or inter-turn silences, as we would call them, indicate that you\u2019re closer with somebody, that the discourse is bubbling and exciting and it\u2019s sort of fun and going well. You\u2019re clicking. Even just thinking about that turn-taking, there\u2019s so much that we can study and learn, even just with that basic mechanical thing."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Then you take turns, and in my research, I\u2019m really interested in topics. What topics are is you take a chunk of turns. You ask me this question, \u201cWhat do you think about structure?\u201d Turns are one organizing structure, but if you take all of the things that we\u2019ve said on this topic about structure, that\u2019s a topic. So we can chunk the turns that we\u2019ve taken on this topic into a topic, and that opens up all new ideas and thoughts about \u201cWell, how do we choose the best topics? And once we\u2019re on a topic, how do we steer it in a direction that serves my purposes, it serves your purposes best? And how do we manage the boundaries between topics?\u201d The topic heuristic is very intuitive to the human mind. What we don\u2019t realize is that we\u2019re making these micro-decisions constantly in our conversations to manage topics. Literally every time you speak, you\u2019re choosing whether to stay on this topic or switch to something else. So I\u2019m trying to be a very polite podcast guest and answer your question about structure, but I could jag and start talking about the Kardashians. That\u2019s an option that I have."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes. Yes. That\u2019s right."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Anyway, that\u2019s topics. Topics chunk our turns into thematic, logical chunks. Then, even still within this mechanical bucket, we think a lot about \u2014 and you said this nicely earlier, what we talk about. There\u2019s actually a lot more complexity there than we might intuitively realize. There\u2019s actually three streams of content. The first is verbal, the words we say to each other. The second is nonverbal, and that\u2019s everything about how your body\u2019s moving, your hand gesticulation, your facial expressions, your eye gaze. Everything that you perceive visually about other people is nonverbal."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Then there\u2019s this third bucket that a lot of people don\u2019t know about or think about as a separate category that\u2019s extremely important for the structure of conversations, and that\u2019s paralanguage, and it\u2019s everything acoustic about how we\u2019re talking to each other that\u2019s not words. Words are the carriers of meaning, but paralanguage also can change the meaning. If I say \u201cAh, I love that, Matt,\u201d that\u2019s very different than \u201cI love that, Matt. I love it.\u201d It changes it entirely, and it\u2019s just an acoustic property, the tone of my voice, how fast I\u2019m saying it, the pausing, whether I laugh while I\u2019m doing it, and there\u2019s so many aspects of paralanguage that that can change."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I want to come back to small talk, because small talk is something that many of us struggle with. The chitchat that we have at mixers or at coffee meetings or even cocktail parties can be really challenging for people. What advice and guidance do you have to make small talk less challenging, and are there certain choices \u2014 you talked about conversation being a series of choices \u2014 that we can make that can help small talk go more smoothly?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yes. Small talk gets a bad rap, man. It\u2019s not fair. It gets a really bad rap. The purpose of small talk is to help us coordinate easily around more interesting topics. Everything about conversation is this sort of coordination kerfuffle. We\u2019re trying to coordinate with another human mind, like \u201cWhat should we be talking about? How should we be interacting? What do I feel safe sharing with you?\u201d et cetera. Small talk is really useful. It\u2019s the predictable way that we open up this really crazy experience we\u2019re about to have together. So I think it gets too bad a rap. It serves a very important sort of search process."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Right now, Alison, we are going to rebrand small talk, you and I, together. We\u2019re going to rebrand it. Okay."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yes. There\u2019s a really amazing article in The Atlantic. It was written by an author, James Parker, and the title of the article was his Ode to Small Talk. I highly recommend this. He had this amazing quote in it where he said, \u201cThe merest morsel of speech can tip you headfirst into the blazing void of another person\u2019s soul,\u201d and it\u2019s really dramatic, but it, I think, captures the spirit of we\u2019re searching for a topic on which we are both excited to move on together. If you think of small talk as a search and really lean into it as this enjoyable search process, then it can become less awkward."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I like that notion of reframing, for sure, and I think that can help, when you see it as serving a purpose beyond just this awkward \u201cI\u2019m standing next to you and need to say something.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ve come to learn \u2014 and I\u2019m curious if you have other insights into this \u2014 that, in small talk, the decisions we make can really influence how the conversation goes. I\u2019ve heard that there are two choices people often make, either supporting choices of the topic that\u2019s being discussed or shifting choices. Do you have insight into that and perhaps other types of choices that we can make to make things better or worse?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yes. We do a lot. We study topic selection a lot, and we call it topic management. Two choices is actually a good heuristic, but it\u2019s oversimplifying what we\u2019re doing, right?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"How we study this \u2014 we study topic selection on a turn-by-turn basis. Every time someone talks, they\u2019re making a micro-decision, and you could imagine it as \u201cI\u2019m staying on this topic. I\u2019m going to support the topic or I\u2019m going to switch.\u201d That\u2019s a good heuristic, but actually, there\u2019s some gray area in between those two poles. There\u2019s also \u201cI\u2019m going to passively let you stay on this topic\u201d versus \u201cI\u2019m going to actively encourage us to stay on this topic. I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s amazing. Tell me more,\u2019\u201d which is very different than \u201cUh-huh.\u201d Right? That\u2019s a big difference."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"The same with switching. You can imagine moves that are very subtly drifting that are almost ambiguous, like we\u2019re not sure if we\u2019re moving onto a new topic or if it\u2019s just sort of like an adjacent fuzzy drift away from the current one. Then there are really aggressive switches to new ones, where we\u2019re talking about conversation with each other, and then I\u2019m like, \u201cAnd also let me tell you about my chicken salad sandwich. Wow. So yummy. Everyone should eat chicken salad.\u201d When we\u2019re making these choices about how to manage topics, there\u2019s shades of things you can do to support, as you said, or switch to something new."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Something that really helps \u2014 we can all feel when the juice is dried up from a topic. What we find in our research is that people who assertively switch in those moments \u2014 they\u2019re great conversationalists. If you can sense, if there\u2019s longer pauses, if there\u2019s awkward laughter, if people start repeating things they\u2019ve already said on the topic, they\u2019re signals that it\u2019s time to switch, and so doing so assertively is something we can all do a little bit better. The risk of it is quite low, actually, because, if either of you feel like you actually have more to say, you could always come back to it. That\u2019s the amazing thing about conversation. You can always go back and say, \u201cOh, yeah, wait. There\u2019s one more thing I wanted to tell you about this, and this was the thing I meant to tell you all along.\u201d Or you can text them afterwards or email them. It\u2019s fine. We have this instinct to be a little afraid to switch topics because it feels rude or abrupt, or maybe they have more to say, when in fact it\u2019s much safer and usually a good idea to switch to something new, because boredom and stagnation are bigger risks than we know."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m not going to take the advice you just gave and abruptly switch topics, because I\u2019m hearing a theme across several of the things you\u2019ve talked about, and it\u2019s really about being sensitive to what\u2019s needed in the moment. To me, this thoughtfulness, this slowing down, is related, really, to listening. You and I study communication, and there\u2019s this notion that, in communication, it\u2019s about what you\u2019re saying."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"But so often I\u2019m coming to realize it\u2019s about what you\u2019re listening and hearing. I know, in a recent chat you and I had a while back, you shared with me that you\u2019re really beginning to focus your research on listening."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019m curious if you could share a little bit about how you see listening and how we can become better listeners."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"It\u2019s so funny that you say this, Matt, because my course is called TALK, and the great irony of it is that I think it should really be called \u201cListen.\u201d That\u2019s one of the biggest takeaways from it, is that it\u2019s so hard to be a good listener and so very important. We have some really exciting research about listening that\u2019s just come out. I work on this topic with a PhD student here at Harvard named Hanne Collins and a co-author named Mike Yeomans and my colleague at the Harvard Kennedy School named Julia Minson."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"What we realized is the human mind is built to wander. It\u2019s not built to focus in on one person for long stretches of time, and yet that\u2019s what conversation demands of our mind, is to really pay attention to those three streams of content that I mentioned earlier, the verbal content, all those nonverbal cues, and also the paralanguage. It\u2019s like drinking from a fire hydrant. We\u2019re bombarded by information, and that information is very interesting. It often makes our minds make connections to random ideas, and then we want to elaborate and think about something else. This sort of feels like a personal profession of my own crazy mind wandering, but really, for everyone, it\u2019s tremendous work to stay focused on a conversation partner as the whole conversation unfolds. What we have found in our research is a key piece of this is, if you\u2019re putting in the effort to listen attentively to somebody, show it to them. Don\u2019t just assume that they know."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"There\u2019s decades and decades of work on active listening. This focuses on things like eye contact and nodding and smiling and laughing at the right times and leaning towards your partner, these sort of nonverbal cues that you\u2019re listening to somebody, and that\u2019s all great, but it\u2019s great as a very basic starting point. What we\u2019re finding now is actually expressing your attentive listening with your words is what makes someone such a compelling communicator. I heard you earlier talking [about] that you also eat the same lunch every day, and the only way that I can say that now is because I was listening to you, and so remembering to bring it up later or express affirmation and say, \u201cThat\u2019s so interesting that you eat the same lunch every day. Why do you do that?\u201d and asking a followup question \u2014 these are undeniable cues that you\u2019ve actually heard someone, processed what they were saying, and you\u2019re repeating it back to them."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"These are the sort of high-fidelity cues of good listening, and often people put in the work to listen to someone, and they just forget to show it. They forget to say it out loud, and it\u2019s a huge missed opportunity. The ways to do this are through things like followup questions, callbacks to earlier topics, paraphrasing what someone has said, or if someone has said something that\u2019s confusing, again revisiting those repair strategies, like can you ask a question that helps to fix a quick misunderstanding or this sort of rift in your shared reality. Can you do it right then and there, like you say, \u201cOh, I heard you say something about listening I didn\u2019t quite understand. Can you explain that a little bit more to me?\u201d All of these things show that you\u2019re listening attentively to someone and that you care."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think the gift of listening is a true gift and having to demonstrate it \u2014 through your words is really, really important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As somebody who hosts a podcast and teaches people how to interview and to run panels, all the skills that you just talked about are critical in that success."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Matt, are you always caught in the meta-loop? Do you feel like you\u2019re floating over the room, watching yourself? It\u2019s like you\u2019re communicating about communication?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Meta-communication is really critical to becoming a better communicator, but I absolutely agree, and I actually describe it just like you did, that to become a better communicator, you have to be engaged in it and present in the moment, but at the same time observing it from above to see what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s needed. Really effective communicators learn how to toggle between those two areas of focus to be effective, and it takes practice and time to do it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You know, Alison, this conversation has been absolutely fantastic. I have learned a lot. I\u2019d love to ask you the same three questions I ask everybody on this podcast. Are you ready for that?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"I was born ready."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Sure. I know that for sure. Question one: if you were to capture the best communication advice you have ever received as a five- to seven-word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"One thing that sticks with me \u2014 this was from a professional matchmaker named Rachel Greenwald, who I love and adore and who also teaches communication. She uses this catchphrase, \u201cBe more interested than interesting.\u201d"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think that\u2019s a really powerful bit of advice, especially going back to the notion of small talk and chitchat. It\u2019s really not about you. It\u2019s about them. And I love that idea about being interested rather than interesting."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Even more profoundly, I know that we both teach about communication and conversation, but to me, conversation is just the vehicle by which we express our humanity to each other and our caring for other people. So this idea of being more interested in others than trying to be interesting yourself is a good nudge to move beyond \u2014 it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about the people that surround you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And what you\u2019re building with them, for sure. I am going to be really curious to hear your answer to this one. Number two: who is a communicator you admire, and why?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Alison Wood Brooks: It\u2019s such a great question. There are so many communicators I admire, Matt. I mean, I admire you as a communicator and for many reasons. Perhaps the most embarrassing one is because you have such a lovely timbre to your voice. It\u2019s pleasant to hear all the time."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Why, thank you."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Yes. We should get you to sing on this podcast."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"No, that would be a disaster."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"I think my real answer here is Stephen Colbert. In my course, we watch a few examples of his live conversation with other people. The first one is a conversation he has with comedian Ricky Gervais, and they\u2019re debating the existence of God."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Ooh."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Have you seen this conversation?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I have not."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Ricky Gervais is trained as a philosopher, and what I love about it is that it\u2019s this super serious topic, which they take seriously, and yet they find these moments of levity that are just so amazing, and even beyond the levity, they show incredible graciousness to the other person\u2019s perspective, in particular Stephen Colbert, so big ups to Stephen Colbert."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Wonderful. Question number three: What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"This is so hard. It\u2019s so hard to pick. As a scientist, I can tell you what the most robust predictors are of a good conversation. It\u2019s hard to narrow it down to three. I think it comes down to choosing good topics and making any topic good, asking good questions, finding moments of levity, and expressing our kindness to other people, but that\u2019s an easy answer, so that\u2019s not going to be my answer."},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"My real answer \u2014 I talk about this. I have a book coming out next year, and so, in the book, we talk about Minding the GAP, G-A-P. G-A-P are these three ingredients of gratitude, so being grateful for your conversation partners even giving you the honor of their time and to be in their presence. The A is acceptance. Every great conversation starts from a place of acceptance. It\u2019s sort of this mantra of \u201cyes and\u201d that we borrow from stand-up comedians. Then the P is patience, so knowing that we\u2019re always going to make mistakes, being patient with ourselves and with other people, and trying to fix them, so being patient with people when we predictably falter."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, I cannot wait for your book to come out, and I really appreciate you filling in those gaps for us today \u2014"},{"author":"Alison Wood Brooks","text":"Aw."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"\u2014 and helping us understand better how we can communicate and converse and really listen, so that we can engage, demonstrate warmth, and learn from others.

I first came to know you and your work when I was writing my book, Speaking Up Without Freaking Out. I came across your research on reframing anxiety.

You mind sharing?"]},{"begin":"87.920","end":"119.440","lines":["Of course. I would love to. When I was in grad school, my dissertation was about anxiety, but what was new about my dissertation as a behavioral scientist was that everybody feels anxious, and not everybody needs therapy or medication or that level of treatment.

There are lots of other tasks that make us feel anxious as well."]},{"begin":"188.560","end":"201.480","lines":["We tried a very simple coping strategy, a very simple intervention, and the question was \u201cCan people reframe their anxious feelings as excitement?\u201d"]},{"begin":"201.480","end":"266.840","lines":["It\u2019s a really simple idea, but the reason that it works is because, when we feel anxious, we have this crazy instinct that we should try and calm down, like really powerful. Everybody feels like they should calm down when they\u2019re anxious, and that\u2019s hard. That would require that we mitigate the physiological signs of anxiety, so your racing heart, sweaty palms, spiked cortisol in your body. You\u2019re trying to push those down, as well as move from the negative valence, like a negative emotion like anxiety, and move into the positive zone of calmness. That two-step move, reducing the physiological signals and moving from negative to positive \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much impossible. It\u2019s very, very hard, especially the physiological component of it. Instead, what reframing as excitement does is it allows you to stay in that high-arousal zone. You\u2019re not trying to combat your automatic physiological processes, but instead, you\u2019re just doing this mental reframe from negative to positive."]},{"begin":"266.840","end":"273.480","lines":["I love that it\u2019s so simple, and in fact, it really is.

It\u2019s T-A-L-K, and it stands for Topics, Asking, Levity, and Kindness. What the course aspires to do is help people talk just a little bit better. I started out in the business school at Harvard teaching negotiation. I started to get a little frustrated. We have such a focus, both as scientists and in public discourse, on difficult conversations or so-called difficult conversations, and this conjures conversations like negotiations or delivering constructive feedback or giving hard advice or these things that we come to think of as difficult. What I\u2019ve realized through my life and teaching and through my research is that even easy conversations are difficult. We don\u2019t just suck at the hard ones.

Anyone who\u2019s listened to this podcast knows that I\u2019m a huge fan of structure in communication. I think it can really help us in many ways. I know you think a lot about structure as well. Can you share your thoughts and research into structure of conversations and how we can better leverage this knowledge to improve those conversations?"]},{"begin":"419.320","end":"429.600","lines":["Yeah, of course. I would love to. When I heard the word structure, it triggers so very many ideas and thoughts for me that I actually wanted to turn this one around on you, Matt, and ask you, when you think of the word structure, especially in the context of communication, what types of things are you thinking about?"]},{"begin":"429.600","end":"457.720","lines":["Great question. For me, a structure is nothing more than a logical connection of ideas. It\u2019s a bridging of ideas, and not only is it the form that the communication takes, but it is the way you think about the communication. Having a structure helps solve one of the two fundamental problems I believe we have in communication: what to say and how to say it. The structure is how you say it, and then you can focus on just what is it you\u2019re saying. People call it story; people call it framework, but it\u2019s really the logical connection of ideas. In a conversation, from my perspective, structure is deployed in lots of different ways, and you\u2019re turn-taking within that structure as well. That\u2019s my perception. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your perception, and what does your research tell us about structure?"]},{"begin":"457.720","end":"481.000","lines":["That was such a great response. It really helped me to understand what you\u2019re thinking about. When I hear the word structure, I think there\u2019s three levels of things that I think about. The first is mechanics, and this gets down to the very basic, sort of fundamental \u201chow does a conversation unfold,\u201d so things like turn-taking and the very definition of what even is a conversation. How we define conversation in our very dry, academic sense is any exchange of verbal content between two or more people. It\u2019s the verbal \u2014 and by verbal, I mean there has to be language. There has to be words. They might be typed. They might be signed through sign language, but there has to be verbal content."]},{"begin":"481.000","end":"510.360","lines":["So the mechanics in my mind are things like turn-taking. I speak, and then you speak, and then someone else speaks, and then I speak, and ideally, you try and avoid as much cross-talk and overlapping turns as possible. You can start to think about what\u2019s the time gap between turns. There\u2019s amazing research showing that shorter pauses between turns, or inter-turn silences, as we would call them, indicate that you\u2019re closer with somebody, that the discourse is bubbling and exciting and it\u2019s sort of fun and going well. You\u2019re clicking. Even just thinking about that turn-taking, there\u2019s so much that we can study and learn, even just with that basic mechanical thing."]},{"begin":"510.360","end":"565.520","lines":["Then you take turns, and in my research, I\u2019m really interested in topics. What topics are is you take a chunk of turns. You ask me this question, \u201cWhat do you think about structure?\u201d Turns are one organizing structure, but if you take all of the things that we\u2019ve said on this topic about structure, that\u2019s a topic. So we can chunk the turns that we\u2019ve taken on this topic into a topic, and that opens up all new ideas and thoughts about \u201cWell, how do we choose the best topics? And once we\u2019re on a topic, how do we steer it in a direction that serves my purposes, it serves your purposes best? And how do we manage the boundaries between topics?\u201d The topic heuristic is very intuitive to the human mind. What we don\u2019t realize is that we\u2019re making these micro-decisions constantly in our conversations to manage topics. Literally every time you speak, you\u2019re choosing whether to stay on this topic or switch to something else. So I\u2019m trying to be a very polite podcast guest and answer your question about structure, but I could jag and start talking about the Kardashians. That\u2019s an option that I have."]},{"begin":"565.520","end":"567.400","lines":["Yes. Yes. That\u2019s right."]},{"begin":"567.400","end":"605.320","lines":["Anyway, that\u2019s topics. Topics chunk our turns into thematic, logical chunks. Then, even still within this mechanical bucket, we think a lot about \u2014 and you said this nicely earlier, what we talk about. There\u2019s actually a lot more complexity there than we might intuitively realize. There\u2019s actually three streams of content. The first is verbal, the words we say to each other. The second is nonverbal, and that\u2019s everything about how your body\u2019s moving, your hand gesticulation, your facial expressions, your eye gaze. Everything that you perceive visually about other people is nonverbal."]},{"begin":"605.320","end":"648.640","lines":["Then there\u2019s this third bucket that a lot of people don\u2019t know about or think about as a separate category that\u2019s extremely important for the structure of conversations, and that\u2019s paralanguage, and it\u2019s everything acoustic about how we\u2019re talking to each other that\u2019s not words. Words are the carriers of meaning, but paralanguage also can change the meaning. If I say \u201cAh, I love that, Matt,\u201d that\u2019s very different than \u201cI love that, Matt. I love it.\u201d It changes it entirely, and it\u2019s just an acoustic property, the tone of my voice, how fast I\u2019m saying it, the pausing, whether I laugh while I\u2019m doing it, and there\u2019s so many aspects of paralanguage that that can change."]},{"begin":"648.640","end":"674.320","lines":["I want to come back to small talk, because small talk is something that many of us struggle with.

How should we be interacting? What do I feel safe sharing with you?\u201d et cetera. Small talk is really useful.

I\u2019ve heard that there are two choices people often make, either supporting choices of the topic that\u2019s being discussed or shifting choices. Do you have insight into that and perhaps other types of choices that we can make to make things better or worse?"]},{"begin":"754.400","end":"764.680","lines":["Yes. We do a lot. We study topic selection a lot, and we call it topic management.

I\u2019m going to support the topic or I\u2019m going to switch.\u201d That\u2019s a good heuristic, but actually, there\u2019s some gray area in between those two poles. There\u2019s also \u201cI\u2019m going to passively let you stay on this topic\u201d versus \u201cI\u2019m going to actively encourage us to stay on this topic. I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s amazing. Tell me more,\u2019\u201d which is very different than \u201cUh-huh.\u201d Right? That\u2019s a big difference."]},{"begin":"802.640","end":"841.920","lines":["The same with switching. You can imagine moves that are very subtly drifting that are almost ambiguous, like we\u2019re not sure if we\u2019re moving onto a new topic or if it\u2019s just sort of like an adjacent fuzzy drift away from the current one. Then there are really aggressive switches to new ones, where we\u2019re talking about conversation with each other, and then I\u2019m like, \u201cAnd also let me tell you about my chicken salad sandwich. Wow. So yummy. Everyone should eat chicken salad.\u201d When we\u2019re making these choices about how to manage topics, there\u2019s shades of things you can do to support, as you said, or switch to something new."]},{"begin":"841.920","end":"899.920","lines":["Something that really helps \u2014 we can all feel when the juice is dried up from a topic. What we find in our research is that people who assertively switch in those moments \u2014 they\u2019re great conversationalists. If you can sense, if there\u2019s longer pauses, if there\u2019s awkward laughter, if people start repeating things they\u2019ve already said on the topic, they\u2019re signals that it\u2019s time to switch, and so doing so assertively is something we can all do a little bit better. The risk of it is quite low, actually, because, if either of you feel like you actually have more to say, you could always come back to it. That\u2019s the amazing thing about conversation. You can always go back and say, \u201cOh, yeah, wait. There\u2019s one more thing I wanted to tell you about this, and this was the thing I meant to tell you all along.\u201d Or you can text them afterwards or email them. It\u2019s fine. We have this instinct to be a little afraid to switch topics because it feels rude or abrupt, or maybe they have more to say, when in fact it\u2019s much safer and usually a good idea to switch to something new, because boredom and stagnation are bigger risks than we know."]},{"begin":"899.920","end":"924.240","lines":["I\u2019m not going to take the advice you just gave and abruptly switch topics, because I\u2019m hearing a theme across several of the things you\u2019ve talked about, and it\u2019s really about being sensitive to what\u2019s needed in the moment. To me, this thoughtfulness, this slowing down, is related, really, to listening.

It\u2019s not built to focus in on one person for long stretches of time, and yet that\u2019s what conversation demands of our mind, is to really pay attention to those three streams of content that I mentioned earlier, the verbal content, all those nonverbal cues, and also the paralanguage. It\u2019s like drinking from a fire hydrant. We\u2019re bombarded by information, and that information is very interesting. It often makes our minds make connections to random ideas, and then we want to elaborate and think about something else. This sort of feels like a personal profession of my own crazy mind wandering, but really, for everyone, it\u2019s tremendous work to stay focused on a conversation partner as the whole conversation unfolds. What we have found in our research is a key piece of this is, if you\u2019re putting in the effort to listen attentively to somebody, show it to them. Don\u2019t just assume that they know."]},{"begin":"1010.600","end":"1065.640","lines":["There\u2019s decades and decades of work on active listening.

What we\u2019re finding now is actually expressing your attentive listening with your words is what makes someone such a compelling communicator. I heard you earlier talking [about] that you also eat the same lunch every day, and the only way that I can say that now is because I was listening to you, and so remembering to bring it up later or express affirmation and say, \u201cThat\u2019s so interesting that you eat the same lunch every day.

They forget to say it out loud, and it\u2019s a huge missed opportunity. The ways to do this are through things like followup questions, callbacks to earlier topics, paraphrasing what someone has said, or if someone has said something that\u2019s confusing, again revisiting those repair strategies, like can you ask a question that helps to fix a quick misunderstanding or this sort of rift in your shared reality. Can you do it right then and there, like you say, \u201cOh, I heard you say something about listening I didn\u2019t quite understand.
