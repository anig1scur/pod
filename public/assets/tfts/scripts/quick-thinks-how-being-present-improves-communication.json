In our first podcast episode on spontaneous speaking, I was joined by fellow Stanford lecturers Dan Klein and Adam Tobin. Today I am thrilled to share an important portion of that conversation that didn\u2019t make it into the episode."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My name is Matt Abrahams and I teach Strategic Communications at Stanford GSB and welcome to a \u201cQuick Thinks\u201d episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"So here you go: this bonus clip from my conversation with two Stanford improv experts on how being in the present moment helps us to be a better communicator."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"We often don\u2019t take the time to be present enough to listen, to understand truly what\u2019s needed in that moment, so we can respond accordingly. Because we\u2019re in our heads, because we\u2019re judging and evaluating, we might miss some nuance or make some assumptions that get in the way of being successful in spontaneous speaking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Curious to know your thoughts about that listening and that present-orientation."},{"author":"Dan Klein","text":"Wait, what did you just ask me? I\u2019m sorry."},{"author":"Dan Klein","text":"(Laughter)"},{"author":"Adam Tobin","text":"Look, if you\u2019re like, locked into a script or locked into this idea of how you\u2019re going to do it, and something is going on, you\u2019re totally not connecting with your audience, with their needs."},{"author":"Adam Tobin","text":"Imagine you\u2019re giving a talk and there\u2019s a fire alarm and the sprinkles go off, and you keep giving your talk. It\u2019s the opposite of actually connecting your material to people. You have to be there and you have to keep bringing the current circumstances to your material so you can get it to people."},{"author":"Dan Klein","text":"Rafe Chase is a brilliant improviser and director here in the Bay Area, who has created amazing theater for more than 30 years. His advice was, \u201cIn the moment when you find yourself thinking about yourself, either in the past of the future, how I did, or how I\u2019m going to do, don\u2019t beat yourself up, but let that be a little trigger/reminder that there\u2019s something to notice right now.\u201d And that\u2019s always true. There\u2019s always something to notice right now."},{"author":"Adam Tobin","text":"And I would say one of the most powerful ideas that improv gave to me personally and then I\u2019ve applied to speaking and pitching movie ideas and to teaching and this room right now, is \u201cit\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s not just about you. It\u2019s really about them.\u201d It\u2019s about your listener. It\u2019s about your partner. It\u2019s about making your partner look good. And if you can get that awareness out of yourself \u2026 There is a great improv maxim that is, \u201cDo what needs to be done, don\u2019t do more, don\u2019t do less, do what needs to be done.\u201d And you only know that if you\u2019re paying attention."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"That\u2019s right. And a great way I think for people to help get in that present moment, not when you\u2019re playing improv games, because improv games invite that, but taking time to greet your audience, take time get to know them, ask questions. It brings you into that present moment. You can\u2019t be worried about everything that could happen if I\u2019m shaking your hand and asking you a question. Another way to make sure that you\u2019re listening well and understanding is using paraphrasing. I\u2019m a big fan of paraphrasing, such that you hear the information and demonstrate you heard the information. There\u2019s no sense communicating if you\u2019re not communicating on the topic that\u2019s needed in that moment."},{"author":"Adam Tobin","text":"I just had an insight about paraphrasing, which is that you\u2019re kind of extending The Now. Right? So now keeps moving past you, but what paraphrasing does is, what they said, you\u2019re saying again, and living in that space for a little moment. Right? Yes, it reaffirms fidelity, \u201cDid I get that message right\u201d, it affirms what they said, \u201cOh I heard you and you said something.\u201d But also, it\u2019s like, before we rush on to what we think about that, or what that means, let\u2019s take a moment and be in that for a second, and it doesn\u2019t take a long time, but it\u2019s in the now."},{"author":"Dan Klein","text":"There\u2019s another piece here. I connect this with teaching, and also to speaking, because teaching is a variation of speaking. Sometimes we really want to get a laugh. A laugh gives us indication that everyone is with us and it\u2019s working. It\u2019s a bit of an ego boost. It also says that we\u2019re alive and together. There are some laughs that are actually costly: If you\u2019re just doing your jokes, if you\u2019re making fun of somebody. You might get the laugh but it won\u2019t actually build that connection. But there is a laugh that you can get which comes from highlighting something funny or interesting that someone else did. So if someone does something funny to be celebrated, as the teacher or as the host, to call it out, you get that laugh, but you get it in service of the other person and of the message. I think it\u2019s true in talks as well. If something happens in the room, that you can call out, it gets the laugh, it\u2019s not you generating a joke and saying \u2018look at me.\u2019 It\u2019s being present in the moment."}],"audio":"https://content.production.cdn.art19.com/segment_lists/aba6adba-86d2-4a83-9750-ca5e4210f956/20200422-UHJlc2VudCBNaW5kZWQgTUlYIDIud2F2-aa05c302-fdf1-4240-aa06-8442054ab8bb.mp3","img":"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/styles/1630x_variable/public/tfts-key_logo_21.jpg.webp?itok=S-EaSW2x","authors":["Matt

It\u2019s really about them.\u201d It\u2019s about your listener. It\u2019s about your partner. It\u2019s about making your partner look good. And if you can get that awareness out of yourself \u2026 There is a great improv maxim that is, \u201cDo what needs to be done, don\u2019t do more, don\u2019t do less, do what needs to be done.\u201d And you only know that if you\u2019re paying attention."]},{"begin":"172.920","end":"210.320","lines":["That\u2019s right. And a great way I think for people to help get in that present moment, not when you\u2019re playing improv games, because improv games invite that, but taking time to greet your audience, take time get to know them, ask questions. It brings you into that present moment. You can\u2019t be worried about everything that could happen if I\u2019m shaking your hand and asking you a question. Another way to make sure that you\u2019re listening well and understanding is using paraphrasing. I\u2019m a big fan of paraphrasing, such that you hear the information and demonstrate you heard the information. There\u2019s no sense communicating if you\u2019re not communicating on the topic that\u2019s needed in that moment."]},{"begin":"210.320","end":"249.120","lines":["I just had an insight about paraphrasing, which is that you\u2019re kind of extending The Now.

Yes, it reaffirms fidelity, \u201cDid I get that message right\u201d, it affirms what they said, \u201cOh I heard you and you said something.\u201d But also, it\u2019s like, before we rush on to what we think about that, or what that means, let\u2019s take a moment and be in that for a second, and it doesn\u2019t take a long time, but it\u2019s in the now."]},{"begin":"249.120","end":"332.640","lines":["There\u2019s another piece here. I connect this with teaching, and also to speaking, because teaching is a variation of speaking. Sometimes we really want to get a laugh. A laugh gives us indication that everyone is with us and it\u2019s working. It\u2019s a bit of an ego boost. It also says that we\u2019re alive and together. There are some laughs that are actually costly: If you\u2019re just doing your jokes, if you\u2019re making fun of somebody. You might get the laugh but it won\u2019t actually build that connection. But there is a laugh that you can get which comes from highlighting something funny or interesting that someone else did. So if someone does something funny to be celebrated, as the teacher or as the host, to call it out, you get that laugh, but you get it in service of the other person and of the message. I think it\u2019s true in talks as well. If something happens in the room, that you can call out, it gets the laugh, it\u2019s not you generating a joke and saying \u2018look at me.\u2019 It\u2019s being present in the moment."]}]}
