Welcome to Think Fast, Talk Smart: the podcast. Today I look forward to speaking with Valerie Fridland. Valerie is a professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Nevada in Reno. She\u2019s an expert on the relationship between language and society and recently released her new book entitled Like Literally Dude: Arguing for the Good in Bad English. Welcome, Valerie. I am super excited to dive into our conversation today."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Well thanks, Matt. I\u2019m really excited to talk with you."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Great. And I love that I just get to say, dude, like I used to say growing up in Northern California near Santa Cruz, I\u2019d like to get started with a high-level question. What is the purpose of language and how does it relate to and reveal who we are?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"The purpose of language is really twofold. It\u2019s about communication of information. So I have a message and I want you to have the same message in your head, and that requires that I somehow get it to you. And the best way to do that is speech. But the second is social. We don\u2019t just talk to transmit information. And so it\u2019s not just the message in my head strictly into your head, it\u2019s also my feelings about the message in my head, my feelings about our relationship, and my sense of how welcome this information might be to you. So all these different factors enter into communication. So language is about how we encode both the linguistic message and that social message."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It really has two elements, the information and the connection as well. And we have to be mindful of that for sure. I have like, lots of detailed questions to ask, so let\u2019s get into them. Can you talk about the power of the word \u201clike\u201d and the power of the word \u201cso?\u201d I see these creeping in everywhere."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Absolutely. And I think a lot of them are thought of as crutch words or words that are not necessary, but really they\u2019re not at all the verbal riffraff that people assign to them. They are really valuable and they both have arisen to serve a need. And everything that we use in language comes in because it has a function that maybe some people don\u2019t value or they have a different way of meeting that need. But then the speakers that bring in those innovations clearly are finding a need for it. And \u201clike\u201d is a perfect example of that. Like has a bunch of different purposes and historically has been in the language a long time. So we find verb like obviously was more like lis at the time, but that comes in around the 12th century into English. And gradually over time, by the time we hit the 15th and 16th century, all of a sudden light could be a preposition and light could be a conjunction."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"That doesn\u2019t mean we always like the new forms of those speech features and even conjunction \u201clike\u201d is still thought of as being incorrect in grammar books. So if you look at contemporary grammar books, a lot of times they\u2019ll tell you \u201cdo not use like as a conjunction.\u201d It\u2019s just sort of an example of how these forms shift over time. We often don\u2019t like them when they\u2019re doing it. But the newest forms of like are ones that are not directly related to the literal meaning of a sentence. And I think that\u2019s why people have a lot of problems with them, but they have a lot of power and purpose. So you can use like as an approximator. So it tells you I\u2019m estimating something, I\u2019m giving imprecise information on purpose and that\u2019s when we use it instead of about. So if I say he\u2019s like 12 years old, I could have said he\u2019s about 12 years old. It\u2019s a one-to-one shift. No one is more meaningless than the other, but simply younger speakers prefer to do it with like and older speakers prefer about. So it\u2019s really just a generational divide."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"In that case we also find it as a sentence particle and that\u2019s where we just sort of put it in for some sort of relational information that it\u2019s giving a listener. So it\u2019s telling a listener \u201cwhat I\u2019m about to say is connected in some way to what I just said.\u201d And that\u2019s usually when you say it\u2019s sentence initially. So you might say, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna go to that party. Like, I\u2019m too tired.\u201d And that\u2019s where I\u2019m saying I\u2019m gonna give you an example or a reason that\u2019s subjective that gives you more information on what I just said. So it\u2019s connecting the two phrases. And the final use is something we call quotative verb, which is \u201cbe like,\u201d so that\u2019s when you\u2019re using it instead of the verb \u201cto say,\u201d to give off the sense that it\u2019s not verbatim, the verb to say really implies this verbatim-ness to it."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"It\u2019s not really what I\u2019m thinking while this is happening, it\u2019s more what I was saying while this is happening, but if I want to convey to you that I was thinking something when an event in the story was happening, the verb \u201cto say\u201d doesn\u2019t allow that kind of subjectivity, but say \u201cI am like\u201d \u201cI was like,\u201d that allows that extra piece of information that \u201cthis is my subjective interpretation of events,\u201d \u201cthis is my thought process\u201d and it doesn\u2019t mislead someone into thinking it was a verbatim quote. So that\u2019s its power: it does these extra things that we don\u2019t have without that feature."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"In terms of so, there are a couple different so\u2019s and several of them are new in our speech, one is the sentence initialed so. Is that the one that you were thinking about?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Yes, or as a transition. Yeah, it\u2019s the same thing."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Okay. Like \u201cSo, I wonder what you\u2019re doing today?\u201d I\u2019ve heard that about that one a lot. I get a lot of emails saying I hate the \u201cso\u201d that comes out at the beginning of the sentence and it\u2019s so funny that people and I there I used this so. It\u2019s everywhere."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"It\u2019s very funny that people dislike that one because there are so many different features we use to connect sentences. So if I say something like, \u201ctherefore thus hereafter,\u201d no one says those are crappy and don\u2019t use them. I might not have friends to go drink at the bar because those sounded a little bit weirdly formal, but they are connectors and so is doing the same kind of work. For some reason people are particularly opposed to so, I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s become pretty prevalent. But the so there functions as something called backstory."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So what it does is it tells somebody, \u201coh, I just said something or you just said something and now I need to connect what I\u2019m going to say to what you said. But I can\u2019t jump directly in because there\u2019s a whole backstory you need to know before I get to telling you what you just asked me.\u201d And I think people don\u2019t like it because sometimes it seems like you\u2019re going off topic, because it\u2019s introducing this backstory. But a lot of times it\u2019s because the speaker feels like that backstory is important to progressing in the conversation. So it has a power and a purpose because it\u2019s introducing supplemental material that otherwise would feel odd without some sort of indicator by a speaker of what its purpose is. And that\u2019s how we all interpret that so."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"It is amazing to me how much work these very tiny words do for us. And I appreciate you articulating just the way these words work. I mean there are almost like Swiss army knives that can help us in so many different situations."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You brought up a point that I didn\u2019t realize was a pet peeve until I heard you speaking. At the beginning of phrases before people have even said anything they\u2019ll say, \u201cI mean\u201d and \u201cyou know\u201d and they haven\u2019t said anything, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with that."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"A lot of times people say them when you\u2019re in conversation and so I mean as usually an indicator that you are going to refine or provide some sort of additional information on something or clarify something that was previously said. And it\u2019s often something that was either said several turns ago that you said, or it\u2019s something that someone asks about or someone makes a comment about that you want to refine their understanding in terms of interpreting what you were saying."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So if someone will say, \u201cI mean I didn\u2019t really think that, but I guess now that you say it, it\u2019s true.\u201d Where it\u2019s sort of saying, \u201cokay, yes, I\u2019m stepping back to further explicate how what I\u2019m saying relates to what you were saying.\u201d You know is interesting because it invites audience inference. That is the idea of you know. So when I say, \u201cwell I was doing this, you know, and then this happened.\u201d What it\u2019s doing is it\u2019s involving the listener in a sort of collective storytelling or collective conversation building."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"And that is why I say, you know, it\u2019s because I wanna involve the listener in some way in this collaborative process. But because it\u2019s inviting listener inference, sometimes listeners don\u2019t interpret it positively because they feel like you\u2019re asking them to do work. It\u2019s asking the listener to refine their thinking or to do extra work in thinking when it\u2019s not their turn. And I think part of the reason that people dislike you know is because they don\u2019t wanna feel involved at that level in someone else\u2019s turn."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So it\u2019s a mismatch I think between my attempts to involve you as a listener in our conversation collaboratively and your attempt to be sort of just a static listener and not have to get involved all the time. It\u2019s definitely age driven. I find that discourse markers are, tend to be used more by young women and some studies have supported that. And older men in particular find them disfavorably, which can then hurt women in these professional contexts because that\u2019s underlyingly an evaluation that no one might be aware they\u2019re making, but they may feel like a woman\u2019s being less certain, or less sure, or less authoritative because she\u2019s inviting inferences from the audience. And we found though, when we look at studies of who uses these, it tends to be people that on psychological tests prove to be more conscientious. So it seems to be, women because historically they\u2019ve been forced to be more the organizers, the conscientious ones, the ones that manage conversation, and that makes them more useful to them."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"You\u2019ve really opened up my mind to these phrases that had been bothersome to me. And it strikes me that you know and I mean are really helping one of the two functions of language, which is the social emotional aspect of it. And that research you shared is fascinating and it certainly highlights the point that the words we use and the way we use those words impact how people see us and what they think about us. And part of the reason why I think what you study is so important for everybody to really take time to understand is: judgments are being made about how you are using language. It\u2019s not just, are you communicating your information well? One of the purposes of language, but the impact of that in terms of the socio-emotional relationship is really playing out."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"In my world, as somebody who focuses on spoken communication, filler words, loom large, the uhs and the ums, they can be very distracting, especially when repeated too often. Many people are given the advice to get rid of these. I\u2019m wondering what is the purpose of them because they\u2019re ubiquitous and do they help us in some way? And to your point you just made, are there differences in terms of gender, age, expertise, when it comes to filler words?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Yes. That\u2019s a big question, so I\u2019m gonna unpack it in a bunch of different little levels. Let\u2019s first tackle the idea of filled pauses, which is what linguists refer to as, um and uh, which are slightly different than filler words more generally from a cognitive standpoint and also from a function standpoint. So things like you know and like don\u2019t actually pattern in the same way as uh and um. So when things don\u2019t pattern in the same way, we kind of separate them."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So \u201cfill pauses\u201d are things that seem to signal cognitive processing load. So they occur mainly before we\u2019re doing really hard cognitive retrieval. So that means they\u2019re going to be more likely before difficult words, more abstract words, less common or familiar words, as well as more hierarchical intensive syntactic structures. What I mean by that is, for example, at the very beginning of a sentence, they\u2019re going to occur more often as we find in research because my brain has to build the entire structure of the sentence before I get started."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"And so the um the uh are signaling, okay, I\u2019m really working hard here. So I think it\u2019s interesting we hate them so much when actually they\u2019re signaling someone\u2019s doing really hard work in that conversation. People that choose very familiar words don\u2019t um and uh as often because they\u2019re not doing such cognitive retrieval. Now that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re doing dumb things: it simply means when I do use them, I\u2019m really working hard at coming up with things that are less familiar for me. The other thing is they have a communicative part."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"And so when I um or uh, not only does it signal I\u2019m doing some hefty cognitive retrieval, but it also signals to a listener that I need a break, I need a pause, and I\u2019m not done with my turn yet. Because we find that when people are either giving lectures or telling stories or talking to computers, all these contexts where we\u2019re not expecting to be interrupted, they um and uh less often, which tells us there\u2019s something intentional and communicative about using those and since we do it, when we\u2019re in conversation more often, what that signals is, \u201cI\u2019m telling you back off buddy, this is my turn and I just need a sec.\u201d"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"And the really fascinating thing is when we study what happens after the um or the uh we find that uh is proceeding shorter delays than um, which suggests that I\u2019m actually intentional in telling you as a listener \u201cthis is going to be just a second and I\u2019m coming right back\u201d or um means \u201cI\u2019m doing more cognitive work and it\u2019s gonna take me a little bit longer.\u201d"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So we really seem to signal very specific information by our choice of whether we, uh or um, and because they signal cognitive processing load, which generally occurs with newer harder information. Listeners seem to become more attentive when we use an uh or an um before words. And when we set them up in eye tracking experiments or with ERP-type brain scan measurements, what we find is it increases their speed at word recognition."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"And this one is the one that makes me really impressed. It also seems to help them remember those words that were preceded by, uh, or, um, better than when they weren\u2019t proceeded by those in the tests that we give them later on. So the funny thing to me is how much we despise um and uh, how much we tell people to get rid of them, when really there\u2019s nothing from a linguistic standpoint that\u2019s not beneficial."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"However, from a social standpoint, clearly they\u2019re not well loved and that means people might perceive you badly when you use them. But, I think what we can do in terms of training ourselves if we\u2019re worried about our ums and uhs, is use the information that linguistics can give us to look at how we can be more effective speakers from a social standpoint, by taking what we know linguistically and applying it to our own practice. So to do that, we need to make things more familiar, make things less difficult and make things less abstract. Because we know that the more we do that, the better we will be in terms of lowering our rate of um and uh. So the more I practice, and the more I\u2019m prepared and familiar with my material, the less likely I am in those contexts to use um and uh because the whole point is I won\u2019t need to be doing as much cognitive activation. And so there are ways that we can use this knowledge to help us with our social knowledge as well."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"There are so many things that um and uh seem to do to really help us. I learned so much from you in that answer. The fact that it signals cognitive processing, which means we\u2019re doing good work on behalf of our audience, and yet the fact that as audiences we might see the um and uh in a very different light, the person\u2019s nervous, isn\u2019t prepared, et cetera is fascinating."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019d love for you to talk to me about how we end our sentences in terms of vocal quality. Some of us go up at the end of our sentences to make them sound like questions even though they\u2019re not. And others of us can get really quiet, or even what\u2019s known as this vocal fry where you get really gravelly at the end of sentences. Does this serve a purpose at all and is it troublesome in terms of language and language use?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"I think it\u2019s only troublesome to those that really dislike it and to the people that are affected by those who dislike it. Uptalk and vocal fry are both things that have been strongly associated with women\u2019s voices in contemporary American culture. And this can be really problematic for women because women tend to be innovators, they generally lead in language change, and women\u2019s voices also historically are not welcomed and many public forums. So when you take voices that are inherently biased against anyway, and then you make them innovators and you do noticeable things like invent new forms and fashions and speech, it doesn\u2019t usually go well for you. And that seems to be what\u2019s happening with both uptalk and vocal fry. Both of those are ways to signal social meaning and usually they signal something about either, you want to make sure people know you\u2019re going to continue your turn. So uptalk in the way that you\u2019re talking about where it\u2019s not actually a rising intonation question, but it\u2019s rising intonation on a statement. That has been used primarily to signal continuation of a speech stream. And so women might be using this more often because often they are talked over."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"So if we look at research particularly in public domains like professional or educational settings, even though there\u2019s a strong belief women talk more in those settings they generally do not, and in fact often don\u2019t speak up because they\u2019re not treated very well when they do, they don\u2019t feel like their voices are welcome. And so it has made them maybe be a little more clear that they\u2019re not done with their speaking term because in those contexts we do find women that tend to get interrupted more often."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"There was a really interesting study of Supreme Court justices where they found in oral arguments, female Supreme Court justices get interrupted at a much higher rate than male Supreme Court justices both by men and women. It wasn\u2019t just men doing it, it was both groups just seemed to interrupt women more. So one solution is to rise your intonation pattern to make sure people are not misreading your turn is being done. So that\u2019s a really effective strategy. It\u2019s not troublesome in the way that it\u2019s actually a very ingenious way to try to get the turn. But it\u2019s troublesome in that people tend to really strongly associate this upward intonation pattern with question formation. And because even though they know you\u2019re not doing a question, because they\u2019re very strongly tied to these norms of what they think speech should be used for in intonation patterns being one way or not another, they often call attention to it."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"The other one you talked about was vocal fry, which is sort of the opposite pattern where you drop in pitch that seems to signal I\u2019m getting to the end of my sentence. So that\u2019s a totally different cue. So instead of signaling continuation, it\u2019s signaling, I\u2019m done with my thought. And it does also seem to be something prevalent in women\u2019s speech in the United States."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"But interestingly, if you look at the studies on vocal fry, historically it tends to be more of a male feature and it was considered a hyper-masculine feature when studied in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. And in fact, even in smartphone data that was culled and studied in 2021 to look at the distribution of vocal fry in British speech, again, it was strongly a male tendency, not a female tendency. But what it has really prompted its use here is again the need for women to adjust their voice to be taken seriously. And we find a correlation with vocal fry and ratings of professionalism, urbanity, and sort of intimacy and relaxed tone. And that seems to be what\u2019s driving young women to use it these days in American speech to get that sort of professional boost and that competence and leadership boost that is associated with low pitch and men\u2019s voices."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Again, both of these are signaling social cues to help people understand how to relate. You\u2019ve certainly underscored the power and status transfer of information that comes through the language we use, the words we use, but also the way in which we say it."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019d like to switch gears here and get to two questions that are rather personal in nature. Several years ago in my Strategic Communication class at the business school, I asked if emojis were appropriate in business communication. And, again, several years ago, I\u2019d say the results were about 50-50 from my students. And just recently knowing I was going to be speaking with you, I asked exactly the same question and the result was dramatically different. Virtually everybody said that emojis are appropriate in business communication."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"As a linguist, what do you think of emojis? Are they appropriate in our communication? Are they serving a purpose and function that words aren\u2019t doing for us?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"I think they absolutely are. There have been some studies in the early two thousands on texting speech or computer-mediated communication, and they looked at things like emojis and they found that they were actually quite rare at that time, they were only about 4% of our communications in that forum. But I think you\u2019re right that in the last 15 years or so, it has grown exponentially how much we use those kinds of meta messaging in our texts and our emails. And I think it\u2019s because there has been such an explosion, especially with the pandemic that even before that, with our forms of communication in the workplace, we have gone from communicating over the phone and face-to-face to communicating primarily over email and texts. I have two teenagers and I don\u2019t think they even know how to use a phone. I\u2019m not kidding."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"My younger son yelled at me for calling him on the phone. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s for. He\u2019s like, \u201cno, no, no, no. This is a texting device.\u201d"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Exactly. So it has shifted so dramatically how much we use these different kinds of techniques of getting in touch. But what the problem is when you\u2019re not face-to-face is the communication of all these social messages that we give when we talk on the phone or we talk face-to-face, are not available to us and things can be misconstrued. So if you say, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Well, when we\u2019re in person, I might say, \u201cwhat are you doing?!\u201d Well, that\u2019s clear for my intonation that you\u2019re doing something wrong. But if I say, \u201cHey, what cha doin\u2019?\u201d That\u2019s clear from my tone of voice that I\u2019m just like, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? Let\u2019s hang out.\u201d So very, very different things for the exact same words, but when you\u2019re on a text or an email, that kind of social messaging isn\u2019t available to you. But what is, are these other new forms of transmitting these emotional and social messages. And emojis are huge in that. And they\u2019re more effective in many ways than some of the things like exclamation points in all caps because there\u2019s so many different forms of them that you can convey all sorts of emotions."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Irony, laughter, love, all of those things are available and accessible. Now, I don\u2019t think I would suggest sending your boss a heart emoji is maybe the right choice, but certainly I think if you say something and you want it to be taken tongue in cheek or is sort of, I don\u2019t wanna be confrontational here. I\u2019m trying to just convey information like, \u201cI need that report by five.\u201d I\u2019m not yelling at you, I\u2019m just requesting. And there\u2019s no way to indicate that unless you use additional information. So I might yell at you by writing all caps, but if I\u2019m just conveying that \u201cI need that report by five and hey, we\u2019re cool,\u201d a smiley face can do a lot of that kind of work for us. So I absolutely think it\u2019s fine, but I also think this is a case where you need to know your audience. If you know that you have a, you know, curmudgeon as a boss that probably has never used an emoji in his life, that wouldn\u2019t be the best choice to use one with him. You just need to be very careful in your wording not to come across as too direct or as somewhat rude, which I think email often can be a forum where that can happen easily."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I predict that if you and I were to have this conversation five, 10 years from now, that sending your boss a heart emoji might be acceptable. It is changing so quickly and so fast that evolution is going to happen. I\u2019m convinced."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I do agree that the subtle cues that you can put in through emojis are really helpful and can help reduce friction and misunderstanding. Now this question is incredibly personal. As a linguist, I\u2019d love to get your take on the very ungrammatical name of this podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart. Do we get a failing grade from a linguist?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Oh no, you get an A plus. Well first of all, it\u2019s really not un grammatical. So if we were outside in Tahoe in 20 feet of snow and I threw a snowball at you and I said, \u201cthink fast!\u201d it would be completely appropriate. So it\u2019s not really ungrammatical if you situationally place it, but what I love is how you\u2019re using one of the first lessons of marketing and branding, which is to make yourself memorable. And if we are all saying the same thing, then saying something different makes us stand out."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"It\u2019s a very effective way to make a name or a title be different, stand out, have more marketing and branding value, because it\u2019s more memorable when it\u2019s not just the same old, same old. And by doing something slightly atypical, you are making people notice it more. So I love the name."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, thank you for that. So Valerie, before we end, I would love to ask you the same three questions that I ask everybody and I\u2019m going to be very curious about the words you choose because I know words are so important to you. If you were to capture the best communication advice you ever received as a five-to-seven word presentation slide title, what would it be?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Sometimes listening is more important than speaking."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Okay."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"That was some great advice I got when I first became an academic, I joined my department as a tenure track professor. As anybody who\u2019s in a university knows, tenure is one of those things where everybody who votes on you is your colleague. You have to be very diplomatic and very careful. I asked a mentor I had what her advice was for how I should approach conversations with my colleagues, participation in departmental meetings. And that was some really good advice. She said listening is sometimes more important than speaking because a lot of people want to hear themselves talk, but very few people want to answer the questions they\u2019re asked. And if you take the time to listen to what people need from you, you\u2019ll be a much more effective speaker and a much more effective teacher. And I think that really has paid off over the years in my classes and in my interactions with people."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, your advice there and the advice you were given is really important. Listening is, I think, the most important part of communication. And clearly somebody who does what you do, you\u2019ve demonstrated throughout our conversation that you listen very astutely, not just for the meaning, but for the use of words and how it plays out. Question number two: who is the communicator that you admire and why?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Now, this is a tough one because I\u2019m torn between ones that I, you know, historically have had a lot of respect for and ones that I think are great communicators in the modern era in ways that people would not expect. So am I allowed two?"},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I\u2019ll give you two. I\u2019m very curious. Now you\u2019ve teased me."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Okay. So I think if I was just going to say who\u2019s a great orator and who I feel has a wonderful cadence and an emotional resonance in the way he talks, that has been appealing to many, many people, I\u2019d say Martin Luther King, of course you cannot listen to I Have a Dream without feeling like you have a dream and there is this dream. It\u2019s so, it captures you, it\u2019s the cadence. It\u2019s such a clear message. I don\u2019t think many people would argue that he was a great communicator, but I think young women in the modern era in terms of their ability to be great communicators and really resonate with an audience, which may not be the audience people want them to resonate with, but the audience that they intend to resonate with and who they reach the most. I would say Taylor Swift is actually a great communicator. I think a lot of people don\u2019t give her credit for that. She has an incredible influence on young people and young women in particular. And she\u2019s also very eloquent, but she\u2019s also using the norms and the functions and the features of today\u2019s young women. So she really resonates and reverberates with that group. And I think that\u2019s really the mark of an effective speaker."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"I think you picked two very, very effective speakers. Very, very different audiences. Very, very different times, but both leveraging many of the things you\u2019ve talked about, the way in which words are constructed and used to get attention and and get messages across. Alright, final question. Question number three: what are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe?"},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"To listen well. Second, to respond kindly and compassionately. And third, to relax. Everything you\u2019re worried about in the speech of people that may not talk like you will work itself out and it\u2019ll only become our new norms or they\u2019ll be on the wayside and it\u2019s not going to cause the decay of English. So I think relax would be my third word in that case."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"And I think that is really important advice. You know, I do a lot of work and I\u2019m sure you do as well with non-native speakers, in our case, to English. And there\u2019s a lot of stress to say it right, you know, whatever that right is. And to relax and understand that there is some give in language and that it will change over time is really important."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Well, Valerie, thank you so much. I have to admit that speaking to a linguist, I was very worried about my word choice. And you made it very comfortable and natural to speak with you. And we learned a lot about not just the purpose of language in terms of transmission of meaning, but of transmitting connection and social relationships and how all of these things came to be. Thank you so much."},{"author":"Valerie Fridland","text":"Absolutely. Thank you for having me on."},{"author":"Matt Abrahams","text":"Thanks for joining us for another episode of Think Fast Talk Smart, the podcast from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

And I love that I just get to say, dude, like I used to say growing up in Northern California near Santa Cruz, I\u2019d like to get started with a high-level question. What is the purpose of language and how does it relate to and reveal who we are?"]},{"begin":"70.200","end":"112.040","lines":["The purpose of language is really twofold. It\u2019s about communication of information. So I have a message and I want you to have the same message in your head, and that requires that I somehow get it to you. And the best way to do that is speech. But the second is social. We don\u2019t just talk to transmit information. And so it\u2019s not just the message in my head strictly into your head, it\u2019s also my feelings about the message in my head, my feelings about our relationship, and my sense of how welcome this information might be to you. So all these different factors enter into communication. So language is about how we encode both the linguistic message and that social message."]},{"begin":"112.040","end":"133.200","lines":["It really has two elements, the information and the connection as well. And we have to be mindful of that for sure. I have like, lots of detailed questions to ask, so let\u2019s get into them. Can you talk about the power of the word \u201clike\u201d and the power of the word \u201cso?\u201d I see these creeping in everywhere."]},{"begin":"133.200","end":"178.840","lines":["Absolutely. And I think a lot of them are thought of as crutch words or words that are not necessary, but really they\u2019re not at all the verbal riffraff that people assign to them. They are really valuable and they both have arisen to serve a need. And everything that we use in language comes in because it has a function that maybe some people don\u2019t value or they have a different way of meeting that need. But then the speakers that bring in those innovations clearly are finding a need for it. And \u201clike\u201d is a perfect example of that. Like has a bunch of different purposes and historically has been in the language a long time. So we find verb like obviously was more like lis at the time, but that comes in around the 12th century into English. And gradually over time, by the time we hit the 15th and 16th century, all of a sudden light could be a preposition and light could be a conjunction."]},{"begin":"178.840","end":"229.520","lines":["That doesn\u2019t mean we always like the new forms of those speech features and even conjunction \u201clike\u201d is still thought of as being incorrect in grammar books. So if you look at contemporary grammar books, a lot of times they\u2019ll tell you \u201cdo not use like as a conjunction.\u201d It\u2019s just sort of an example of how these forms shift over time. We often don\u2019t like them when they\u2019re doing it. But the newest forms of like are ones that are not directly related to the literal meaning of a sentence. And I think that\u2019s why people have a lot of problems with them, but they have a lot of power and purpose. So you can use like as an approximator. So it tells you I\u2019m estimating something, I\u2019m giving imprecise information on purpose and that\u2019s when we use it instead of about. So if I say he\u2019s like 12 years old, I could have said he\u2019s about 12 years old. It\u2019s a one-to-one shift. No one is more meaningless than the other, but simply younger speakers prefer to do it with like and older speakers prefer about. So it\u2019s really just a generational divide."]},{"begin":"229.520","end":"272.720","lines":["In that case we also find it as a sentence particle and that\u2019s where we just sort of put it in for some sort of relational information that it\u2019s giving a listener. So it\u2019s telling a listener \u201cwhat I\u2019m about to say is connected in some way to what I just said.\u201d And that\u2019s usually when you say it\u2019s sentence initially. So you might say, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna go to that party. Like, I\u2019m too tired.\u201d And that\u2019s where I\u2019m saying I\u2019m gonna give you an example or a reason that\u2019s subjective that gives you more information on what I just said. So it\u2019s connecting the two phrases. And the final use is something we call quotative verb, which is \u201cbe like,\u201d so that\u2019s when you\u2019re using it instead of the verb \u201cto say,\u201d to give off the sense that it\u2019s not verbatim, the verb to say really implies this verbatim-ness to it."]},{"begin":"272.720","end":"307.240","lines":["It\u2019s not really what I\u2019m thinking while this is happening, it\u2019s more what I was saying while this is happening, but if I want to convey to you that I was thinking something when an event in the story was happening, the verb \u201cto say\u201d doesn\u2019t allow that kind of subjectivity, but say \u201cI am like\u201d \u201cI was like,\u201d that allows that extra piece of information that \u201cthis is my subjective interpretation of events,\u201d \u201cthis is my thought process\u201d and it doesn\u2019t mislead someone into thinking it was a verbatim quote.

I might not have friends to go drink at the bar because those sounded a little bit weirdly formal, but they are connectors and so is doing the same kind of work.

But a lot of times it\u2019s because the speaker feels like that backstory is important to progressing in the conversation.

It\u2019s asking the listener to refine their thinking or to do extra work in thinking when it\u2019s not their turn.

It\u2019s definitely age driven. I find that discourse markers are, tend to be used more by young women and some studies have supported that. And older men in particular find them disfavorably, which can then hurt women in these professional contexts because that\u2019s underlyingly an evaluation that no one might be aware they\u2019re making, but they may feel like a woman\u2019s being less certain, or less sure, or less authoritative because she\u2019s inviting inferences from the audience. And we found though, when we look at studies of who uses these, it tends to be people that on psychological tests prove to be more conscientious.

And part of the reason why I think what you study is so important for everybody to really take time to understand is: judgments are being made about how you are using language.

That\u2019s a big question, so I\u2019m gonna unpack it in a bunch of different little levels.

So things like you know and like don\u2019t actually pattern in the same way as uh and um.

What I mean by that is, for example, at the very beginning of a sentence, they\u2019re going to occur more often as we find in research because my brain has to build the entire structure of the sentence before I get started."]},{"begin":"710.400","end":"737.360","lines":["And so the um the uh are signaling, okay, I\u2019m really working hard here. So I think it\u2019s interesting we hate them so much when actually they\u2019re signaling someone\u2019s doing really hard work in that conversation. People that choose very familiar words don\u2019t um and uh as often because they\u2019re not doing such cognitive retrieval. Now that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re doing dumb things: it simply means when I do use them, I\u2019m really working hard at coming up with things that are less familiar for me. The other thing is they have a communicative part."]},{"begin":"737.360","end":"772.840","lines":["And so when I um or uh, not only does it signal I\u2019m doing some hefty cognitive retrieval, but it also signals to a listener that I need a break, I need a pause, and I\u2019m not done with my turn yet. Because we find that when people are either giving lectures or telling stories or talking to computers, all these contexts where we\u2019re not expecting to be interrupted, they um and uh less often, which tells us there\u2019s something intentional and communicative about using those and since we do it, when we\u2019re in conversation more often, what that signals is, \u201cI\u2019m telling you back off buddy, this is my turn and I just need a sec.\u201d"]},{"begin":"772.840","end":"792.360","lines":["And the really fascinating thing is when we study what happens after the um or the uh we find that uh is proceeding shorter delays than um, which suggests that I\u2019m actually intentional in telling you as a listener \u201cthis is going to be just a second and I\u2019m coming right back\u201d or um means \u201cI\u2019m doing more cognitive work and it\u2019s gonna take me a little bit longer.\u201d"]},{"begin":"792.360","end":"819.400","lines":["So we really seem to signal very specific information by our choice of whether we, uh or um, and because they signal cognitive processing load, which generally occurs with newer harder information. Listeners seem to become more attentive when we use an uh or an um before words. And when we set them up in eye tracking experiments or with ERP-type brain scan measurements, what we find is it increases their speed at word recognition."]},{"begin":"819.400","end":"841.800","lines":["And this one is the one that makes me really impressed. It also seems to help them remember those words that were preceded by, uh, or, um, better than when they weren\u2019t proceeded by those in the tests that we give them later on. So the funny thing to me is how much we despise um and uh, how much we tell people to get rid of them, when really there\u2019s nothing from a linguistic standpoint that\u2019s not beneficial."]},{"begin":"841.800","end":"894.400","lines":["However, from a social standpoint, clearly they\u2019re not well loved and that means people might perceive you badly when you use them. But, I think what we can do in terms of training ourselves if we\u2019re worried about our ums and uhs, is use the information that linguistics can give us to look at how we can be more effective speakers from a social standpoint, by taking what we know linguistically and applying it to our own practice. So to do that, we need to make things more familiar, make things less difficult and make things less abstract. Because we know that the more we do that, the better we will be in terms of lowering our rate of um and uh. So the more I practice, and the more I\u2019m prepared and familiar with my material, the less likely I am in those contexts to use um and uh because the whole point is I won\u2019t need to be doing as much cognitive activation. And so there are ways that we can use this knowledge to help us with our social knowledge as well."]},{"begin":"894.400","end":"914.680","lines":["There are so many things that um and uh seem to do to really help us. I learned so much from you in that answer.

Some of us go up at the end of our sentences to make them sound like questions even though they\u2019re not. And others of us can get really quiet, or even what\u2019s known as this vocal fry where you get really gravelly at the end of sentences. Does this serve a purpose at all and is it troublesome in terms of language and language use?"]},{"begin":"939.880","end":"1008.560","lines":["I think it\u2019s only troublesome to those that really dislike it and to the people that are affected by those who dislike it. Uptalk and vocal fry are both things that have been strongly associated with women\u2019s voices in contemporary American culture. And this can be really problematic for women because women tend to be innovators, they generally lead in language change, and women\u2019s voices also historically are not welcomed and many public forums. So when you take voices that are inherently biased against anyway, and then you make them innovators and you do noticeable things like invent new forms and fashions and speech, it doesn\u2019t usually go well for you. And that seems to be what\u2019s happening with both uptalk and vocal fry. Both of those are ways to signal social meaning and usually they signal something about either, you want to make sure people know you\u2019re going to continue your turn. So uptalk in the way that you\u2019re talking about where it\u2019s not actually a rising intonation question, but it\u2019s rising intonation on a statement. That has been used primarily to signal continuation of a speech stream. And so women might be using this more often because often they are talked over."]},{"begin":"1008.560","end":"1033.640","lines":["So if we look at research particularly in public domains like professional or educational settings, even though there\u2019s a strong belief women talk more in those settings they generally do not, and in fact often don\u2019t speak up because they\u2019re not treated very well when they do, they don\u2019t feel like their voices are welcome. And so it has made them maybe be a little more clear that they\u2019re not done with their speaking term because in those contexts we do find women that tend to get interrupted more often."]},{"begin":"1033.640","end":"1082.600","lines":["There was a really interesting study of Supreme Court justices where they found in oral arguments, female Supreme Court justices get interrupted at a much higher rate than male Supreme Court justices both by men and women. It wasn\u2019t just men doing it, it was both groups just seemed to interrupt women more. So one solution is to rise your intonation pattern to make sure people are not misreading your turn is being done. So that\u2019s a really effective strategy. It\u2019s not troublesome in the way that it\u2019s actually a very ingenious way to try to get the turn. But it\u2019s troublesome in that people tend to really strongly associate this upward intonation pattern with question formation. And because even though they know you\u2019re not doing a question, because they\u2019re very strongly tied to these norms of what they think speech should be used for in intonation patterns being one way or not another, they often call attention to it."]},{"begin":"1082.600","end":"1100.840","lines":["The other one you talked about was vocal fry, which is sort of the opposite pattern where you drop in pitch that seems to signal I\u2019m getting to the end of my sentence. So that\u2019s a totally different cue. So instead of signaling continuation, it\u2019s signaling, I\u2019m done with my thought. And it does also seem to be something prevalent in women\u2019s speech in the United States."]},{"begin":"1100.840","end":"1152.160","lines":["But interestingly, if you look at the studies on vocal fry, historically it tends to be more of a male feature and it was considered a hyper-masculine feature when studied in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. And in fact, even in smartphone data that was culled and studied in 2021 to look at the distribution of vocal fry in British speech, again, it was strongly a male tendency, not a female tendency. But what it has really prompted its use here is again the need for women to adjust their voice to be taken seriously. And we find a correlation with vocal fry and ratings of professionalism, urbanity, and sort of intimacy and relaxed tone. And that seems to be what\u2019s driving young women to use it these days in American speech to get that sort of professional boost and that competence and leadership boost that is associated with low pitch and men\u2019s voices."]},{"begin":"1152.160","end":"1168.280","lines":["Again, both of these are signaling social cues to help people understand how to relate.

Several years ago in my Strategic Communication class at the business school, I asked if emojis were appropriate in business communication. And, again, several years ago, I\u2019d say the results were about 50-50 from my students. And just recently knowing I was going to be speaking with you, I asked exactly the same question and the result was dramatically different. Virtually everybody said that emojis are appropriate in business communication."]},{"begin":"1199.240","end":"1208.640","lines":["As a linguist, what do you think of emojis?

There have been some studies in the early two thousands on texting speech or computer-mediated communication, and they looked at things like emojis and they found that they were actually quite rare at that time, they were only about 4% of our communications in that forum. But I think you\u2019re right that in the last 15 years or so, it has grown exponentially how much we use those kinds of meta messaging in our texts and our emails. And I think it\u2019s because there has been such an explosion, especially with the pandemic that even before that, with our forms of communication in the workplace, we have gone from communicating over the phone and face-to-face to communicating primarily over email and texts. I have two teenagers and I don\u2019t think they even know how to use a phone. I\u2019m not kidding."]},{"begin":"1257.320","end":"1263.560","lines":["My younger son yelled at me for calling him on the phone. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s for.

So it has shifted so dramatically how much we use these different kinds of techniques of getting in touch. But what the problem is when you\u2019re not face-to-face is the communication of all these social messages that we give when we talk on the phone or we talk face-to-face, are not available to us and things can be misconstrued. So if you say, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Well, when we\u2019re in person, I might say, \u201cwhat are you doing?!\u201d Well, that\u2019s clear for my intonation that you\u2019re doing something wrong. But if I say, \u201cHey, what cha doin\u2019?\u201d That\u2019s clear from my tone of voice that I\u2019m just like, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? Let\u2019s hang out.\u201d So very, very different things for the exact same words, but when you\u2019re on a text or an email, that kind of social messaging isn\u2019t available to you. But what is, are these other new forms of transmitting these emotional and social messages. And emojis are huge in that. And they\u2019re more effective in many ways than some of the things like exclamation points in all caps because there\u2019s so many different forms of them that you can convey all sorts of emotions."]},{"begin":"1323.760","end":"1386.160","lines":["Irony, laughter, love, all of those things are available and accessible. Now, I don\u2019t think I would suggest sending your boss a heart emoji is maybe the right choice, but certainly I think if you say something and you want it to be taken tongue in cheek or is sort of, I don\u2019t wanna be confrontational here. I\u2019m trying to just convey information like, \u201cI need that report by five.\u201d I\u2019m not yelling at you, I\u2019m just requesting. And there\u2019s no way to indicate that unless you use additional information. So I might yell at you by writing all caps, but if I\u2019m just conveying that \u201cI need that report by five and hey, we\u2019re cool,\u201d a smiley face can do a lot of that kind of work for us. So I absolutely think it\u2019s fine, but I also think this is a case where you need to know your audience. If you know that you have a, you know, curmudgeon as a boss that probably has never used an emoji in his life, that wouldn\u2019t be the best choice to use one with him.

As anybody who\u2019s in a university knows, tenure is one of those things where everybody who votes on you is your colleague. You have to be very diplomatic and very careful. I asked a mentor I had what her advice was for how I should approach conversations with my colleagues, participation in departmental meetings. And that was some really good advice. She said listening is sometimes more important than speaking because a lot of people want to hear themselves talk, but very few people want to answer the questions they\u2019re asked. And if you take the time to listen to what people need from you, you\u2019ll be a much more effective speaker and a much more effective teacher.

So I think if I was just going to say who\u2019s a great orator and who I feel has a wonderful cadence and an emotional resonance in the way he talks, that has been appealing to many, many people, I\u2019d say Martin Luther King, of course you cannot listen to I Have a Dream without feeling like you have a dream and there is this dream. It\u2019s so, it captures you, it\u2019s the cadence. It\u2019s such a clear message. I don\u2019t think many people would argue that he was a great communicator, but I think young women in the modern era in terms of their ability to be great communicators and really resonate with an audience, which may not be the audience people want them to resonate with, but the audience that they intend to resonate with and who they reach the most. I would say Taylor Swift is actually a great communicator. I think a lot of people don\u2019t give her credit for that. She has an incredible influence on young people and young women in particular. And she\u2019s also very eloquent, but she\u2019s also using the norms and the functions and the features of today\u2019s young women. So she really resonates and reverberates with that group.
