It's Marielle. For a long time, I had this idea that solo travel would be sad for me, that I might see beautiful sunsets or cityscapes, but they wouldn't mean anything if I had no one to look at them with. Well, that's just not true. Turns out I love looking at a sunset alone. Also, I meet people wherever I go. And I love having the freedom to do whatever I want and not feeling guilty if it doesn't match up with somebody else's plan. I've traveled solo in Arizona, Puerto Rico, Belize, France, the U.K. and some other places, too. I mean, it is different. There's a lot to plan for, and there are moments when you're thinking, should I really be doing this?"},{"author":"AMELIA EDELMAN","text":"I will never forget traveling solo to Slovenia - my first time ever leaving both of my kids for a week."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Journalist Amelia Edelman covers travel, as well as parenting and psychology. She's gone on countless trips with her family. But planning this solo trip - preparing to be an ocean and multiple connecting flights away from her kids - stressed her out more than all the other trips where she planned for, packed for and carried a small child or two across continents."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"I had been so nervous during the planning and packing stages for the Solovenia (ph) trip I had invented."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Why did traveling without the extra hassle of parenting feel so much more daunting? Shouldn't it feel easier?"},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Even as a seasoned traveler, crossing the ocean alone was different. I was so anxious about leaving my family behind, about being totally on my own, that I could barely get myself onto the plane. But as soon as I landed and set about wandering Ljubljana by myself, I was flooded with relief and excitement. Suddenly, I just knew the trip was going to be amazing. And it was. I had merely psyched myself out beforehand because it was different from how I usually travel with my family."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"Solo travel does seem to be getting more popular. According to Hilton's 2026 travel trends report, more than 1 in 4 of the travelers surveyed plan to travel alone this year. And 48% of travelers reported adding solo travel days to their itineraries before or after their 2026 family trips. So on this episode of LIFE KIT - how to plan a solo trip. Amelia talks to travel and psychology experts about how to choose a destination, how to take care of yourself by planning ahead, and what to do if loneliness strikes while you're away."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Of course, people's reasons for solo travel are wide-ranging. Maybe you're seeking a break, an adventure or, like me, simply some time away from all the other people involved in your day to day."},{"author":"MARQUITA HARRIS","text":"I was burnt out. I was tired. I needed a change."},{"author":"CAMERON CLARK","text":"I had just gone through a breakup."},{"author":"JOY FOX","text":"That was the first time I'd ever been anywhere out of the village, actually. You know, it was in England. A small village in England, in Essex."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That first voice you hear is travel journalist Marquita Harris, who was selected to spend all of 2021 traveling the world solo through Airbnb's Live Anywhere program. While she jumped into the metaphorical solo travel deep end, living and working in a different country every month, she recommends first-time solo travelers take it slower to start strengthening those solo sea legs. That's takeaway No. 1 - start small."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"You're arriving at a destination, and the only person you really have to rely on is yourself. It can be a little intimidating, like, when you don't have to cater to your partner or a friend or your kids or, you know, to a job (laughter)."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Marquita suggests trying out some solo mini trips close to your home first to get a sense of how you plan, manage and meander when it's all on you."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"Just, like, see if you can just have a beach day by yourself somewhere that's local."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"For some people, it's even, like, running errands by yourself."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's psychotherapist Cameron Clark, who specializes in trauma-informed therapy and strengthening clients' relationships with the self."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"You know, like, taking a trip to the bookstore or the grocery store without your cellphone. Taking a day trip and going to a place that maybe you've never been before and exploring on your own and then maybe building up to a weekend trip."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"You can even start small by planning a regular old not-solo trip and then testing the solo travel waters while you're there."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"Maybe it's taking a trip where you're on a trip with friends, and you decide to take one day out of that weeklong trip to do something on your own."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Of course, starting small isn't a requirement. Just ask Joy Fox, who, at age 90, has spent nearly 70 years traveling solo and has become well known for sharing her story. Her first solo trip happened when she was in her 20s and her fiance broke off their engagement. She pawned her engagement ring and went straight to Italy by herself without ever having left her small English village before."},{"author":"FOX","text":"I know I was heartbroken when I went. And I didn't seem to be that heartbroken when I got there because then I met, you know, the beautiful Luigi, who showed me the whole of, you know, the Italian Riviera and all of the big cities around on the back of his scooter. And it was such a great adventure. That was really the start."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"So if you, too, are aiming to rip off the Band-Aid and do a first solo trip somewhere across the world from where you live, you can and should do that if it's your dream. Just be smart about where you choose to go. That's takeaway No. 2 - land on a destination that suits both you and your goals. Once you are ready to head off to another country solo, Marquita has some tips for choosing that first destination."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"The best thing to do is go somewhere that's English-speaking or that speaks whatever languages that you know."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That said, if your goal is to, say, go to France this year and you've only just downloaded Duolingo, Joy says don't sweat it."},{"author":"FOX","text":"Just learn a little bit of the language, even if it's only bonjour or, you know, where's the toilet?"},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Another consideration when selecting a solo travel destination - you'll first want to figure out what kind of trip you're looking for and how that might work for you on your own."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"I have friends that - they are opposed to cities (laughter), especially if you're in New York. I have a lot of friends that are like, I can do that here and it's better than New York."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"So take a close look at what you actually want when you travel. Maybe you always love a family beach trip, but you don't like the idea of beaching all by yourself. Do you want to sign up for a group retreat, something like yoga or surfing, or a group tour, where you're solo but together and the guides kind of handle everything? Or would you prefer to strike out totally on your own and improvise when it comes to activities?"},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"Saying like, OK, like, I want these things. I want this experience."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"From there, aim for somewhere that's easy to navigate, diverse, welcoming and that already sees people like you, locals and travelers alike."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"Lisbon was my favorite - because it was so easy - in the world. I made so many friends there. I connected with other, like, Black expats. I've never felt safer anywhere else."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Meanwhile, a place that one traveler finds uncomfortable may land in another traveler's comfort zone or vice versa. Cameron says that's crucial to keep in mind if you're selecting a solo destination based off of influencer recommendations. Instagram is not reality."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"We get a lot of input from media - right? - that tells us what this should feel like or what it should look like or what we can expect. And while there is some truth to some of that stuff, which is why we talk about these things in generalities, our own personal experience of what that feels like is going to look really different."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"The worst experience I had was in Malibu (laughter). It was in the U.S."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's Marquita, who, after spending 12 months in 12 countries, discovered that the most frightening country was home."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"I was at an Airbnb, and the host was just deeply racist. And I felt unsafe. Like, racism, anti-Blackness, misogyny, all of these things - they're everywhere."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"On the other hand, she says her family and friends were scared that she planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by herself. And those fears were unfounded."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"And I loved Rio. I've never been to a place where so many people looked like me. I will sing its praises, I think, especially for Black travelers."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"You want to find that fine line between being prepared and being hypervigilant. You want to take safety precautions, but don't let being solo put you into a spiral where you try to create the padded room of trips that doesn't leave any room for serendipity. Your best bet, rather than trying to preschedule your trip down to the minute, is just doing enough research that you get a solid sense of the destination - information about what it will be like to be there on a practical level."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"Maybe that looks like calling a friend who's been the place that you've been before and saying, how queer-friendly is this city? What neighborhoods or places that I might want to go see that are going to feel safe for me as a person of color? What is it about the transportation in this place, and what do I need to know before I get there so that I can plan ahead? Am I going to want to rent a car, or is public transportation something that feels safe? I think those are things that can be really, really helpful."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's takeaway No. 3 - plan ahead to avoid travel pitfalls. If there are particular sites you know you want to see while you're there, restaurants you don't want to miss, cross-check their hours online in advance and look for any seasonal closures."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"Why didn't I know that there were so many religious holidays (laughter)?"},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's Marquita. She got to Medellin, Colombia, during a holiday-heavy season and discovered much of the city's establishments were closed."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"I was so excited. And it was just - I mean, I hate to say it, but it was, like, the most boring trip I've ever had."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"So check in advance for closures, as well as events or festivals that might mean there are too many people in town rather than too few. Solo travelers or - let's be real - any travelers might be more comfortable avoiding, say, Rio during Carnival, New Orleans during Mardi Gras or Santorini during the entire summertime. Stick to shoulder seasons and you'll avoid overwhelming crowds and shuttered businesses."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Planning well can also help you avoid the dreaded single supplement tax. That's a travel industry premium that is sometimes charged to solo travelers when they take a room alone - a room that the group tour or cruise could otherwise book two people into for more of a profit."},{"author":"FOX","text":"Years ago, when this was set up, you know, everything was set up for two people."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's Joy. The single supplement can range from an additional 5% to up to 200% of the standard accommodation cost."},{"author":"FOX","text":"I don't want to pay it anymore. I've paid it for years and years. So I am trying to find trips now that either give you a heavy discount or don't charge it at all. And there are quite a few companies coming up now that are, you know, putting the single supplement aside, which is a good thing."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"If you're booking a group tour or cruise, aim for a tour company that doesn't charge a single supplement or a cruise line that offers dedicated solo cabins. Planning ahead gives you the best opportunity to take full advantage of programs and resources that are tailored to solo travelers. Joy recommends organizations like Women Welcome Women Worldwide and Solos."},{"author":"FOX","text":"You can travel solo, and you can have two or three nights with somebody who will host you and show you what they do locally. So it's a very good way of getting to know the country and the culture."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Of course, you won't be able to suss out everything about a destination in advance, and that's OK. Taking risks, within reason, can be huge when building your confidence as a solo traveler. We'll explain how to do that when LIFE KIT returns after the break."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Here's takeaway No. 4 - know when to get out of your comfort zone and when to stay right there."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"Maybe challenging this idea that all of our T's have to be crossed and all of our I's need to be dotted and we have to be fully secure and ready before we take a risk. There's a ton of really interesting research about this, actually, that says the more risks that we take, the more confident that we feel and the less anxiety we're going to have in distressing situations."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"The important thing - it's finding your own unique balance between a little risk-taking and still being functional and fun."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"We never want to push ourselves past a place of moderate discomfort because then we have the potential to kind of pop out of our window of tolerance. And all of a sudden, we get validated that travel is scary and bad and we shouldn't be doing that. So we want to, like, stay within a threshold that feels manageable."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Experiencing discomfort, Cameron explains, is a normal and healthy part of the learning and growing process when trying something new, certainly including solo travel. It's important not to run from it."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"So we want to expect to take a solo trip and feel totally fine and not feel uncomfortable or not feel fearful or not feel lonely. And the reality is, is those are really normal parts of being human. And solo travel, in whatever form you choose to take it, is such a great platform and space to challenge your humanness and to learn how to be with your humanness. If we want more comfort doing it, then we have to do more of it."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Yeah. The best way to travel solo is to travel solo (laughter)."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"That's right."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"You might be able to help strike this balance by making sure you have what you need. Maybe you get overstimulated in airports. Bring noise-canceling headphones. Or maybe you know you tend to spiral when you have low blood sugar. Bring your favorite snacks."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"I also just learned that your mistakes are often what make the best stories and what also get you out of your - I'm going to say comfort box. You got to get out of the box."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's Marquita. She reminds travelers that while loneliness can happen, of course - in fact, on your first solo trip, it's probably more than likely at some point - it's not the end of the world."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"They call it travelers' melancholy. I got tired of myself. I'm like, oh, my gosh, like, I don't want to - I need to hear another voice besides my own. And that - for some people, that might manifest in a certain existential loneliness. And I think that's fine. I think use that to kind of push you to book a tour. The loneliness - you deal with it by just approaching it head-on because you should know who you are in these circumstances."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Joy says she has often been told she's brave for traveling on her own and pushing through those moments of discomfort. But she disagrees."},{"author":"FOX","text":"I'm not brave. Every time I do something different, I'm scared of how it's going to turn out, so I'm not brave. But life is too short to sit around and have regrets about not doing something."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"She recommends taking your time to sit with that discomfort or loneliness and giving yourself a lot of grace. Joy also recommends little luxuries within your budget when traveling solo, such as upgrading to premium economy for flights and prebooking reliable airport transfer rather than chancing it on public transport. That's especially true if mobility issues are something that makes you feel nervous about traveling solo."},{"author":"FOX","text":"That's a feel-good thing when you come back, to know that there's a guy waiting for you who's going to take you right to the door and drop you off. I'm still in pretty good health. I haven't had anything exchanged inside of me. You know, I've had no new knees or hips. So I'm fortunate that way, but I do have a little mobility issue. And, you know, when I was going to Iceland, I thought, oh my God. Will I be able to keep up? So it's just a comfort thing. And that's always going to be a part of the budget, is a ride to the airport and back."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Booking that nicer airport transfer or that comfier tour through a location where you're feeling particularly nervous or unfamiliar can be a great way to rely on others while you're traveling solo, says Cameron."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"We never want to be only relying on ourselves or only relying on other people. We want there to be a nice blend and a nice flexibility between the two things. And knowing we have security on both sides gives us the ability to be more resilient than if we're only taking care of ourselves or only relying on others to take care of us."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Of course, even if you plan that ride and plan that tour, when you make a plan, the universe laughs. And in the moments when that happens, and with travel, it likely will, look to takeaway No. 5 - be prepared to pivot. During Marquita's year abroad, she honed her when-to-fold skills - when to sit with an icky feeling versus when to move onward and upward. Like when she treated herself solo to one particularly fancy restaurant."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"It's like this huge, like, pomp and circumstance. And there's all of these cute couples, and I'm like, oh no. Now I'm going to feel like, should I be here with a man? Should I be here with a - with another person? That experience definitely made me feel like, OK, this is not for me."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"The experience made Marquita realize that while she enjoys sharing the occasional white-tablecloth meal with others, she's more comfortable as a casual diner when flying solo. She says you will likely encounter things like this, parts of a trip that turn out not to be your cup of tea. And if so, you should have no qualms ditching them."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"I really think that's the key to all travel. No matter if you're going by yourself or, you know, with a group, you got to move on. And if you can't move on, then you need to hop on a plane and get back home and, you know, take care of yourself. Period."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Cameron agrees and adds that all that preplanning you did before your trip should set you up for success when it comes to deviating from that plan. Maybe you list out a few potential backup accommodations in advance or casual restaurants in case you aren't feeling fancy after all."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"We're working a little bit on building our trust within ourselves to know that if something does happen, I can take care of myself and I know how to reach out for support, and I've put these things in place in the event that I need them."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"And know that whether or not those last-minute pivots are needed, you're never truly alone."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"You're going to befriend, you know, the person that helps you up the mountain."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That's Marquita with takeaway No. 6 - make connections."},{"author":"HARRIS","text":"There's always a friend somewhere, and I think in a weird way, solo travel has taught me that. You're never alone, and I think that's the cool part with solo travel."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"If you're feeling shy or at a loss for where to start making those connections when you're somewhere new, Joy says it's easier than you might think."},{"author":"FOX","text":"You know, smile and maybe give them a compliment about something and - or ask a question. And suddenly, you're not really on your own because I just think there's kindness everywhere. I think when you're traveling on your own, you've got the best of both worlds. You know, you can join people, you can talk to people or not. And if you enjoy your own company, as I do - I'm OK with myself - I don't feel loneliness."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"That sense of connection with other people or cute animals or even connecting with yourself can be huge in finding the joy in solo travel. Here's Cameron."},{"author":"CLARK","text":"I do think that solo travel has the ability to help us really deepen our experience of trusting ourselves."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"She recommends asking a local, like your server at a bar, for recommendations, or goofing with a cute pet or a kid you encounter. Even pulling out your journal and taking time to connect with yourself. Best of all, the connections and lessons you make on the road can inform and serve your home life in the most valuable ways. Here's Joy."},{"author":"FOX","text":"I love my solitary life. I love silence, the morning - you know, the magic hour in the morning outside when the bees are all falling asleep on the flowers. I just really - I really, really appreciate everything I've got, and I'm grateful for everything I've got. It's wonderful to go, but it's even more wonderful to come back."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"So to recap, takeaway No. 1 - start small, whether that's with a day trip, a solo sojourn off a group vacation or even just a local day of errands or events around town by yourself, no phone."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Takeaway No. 2 - land on a destination that makes sense for you, even if it doesn't look like all those travel TikTok reels your friends send."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Takeaway No. 3 - plan ahead to avoid travel pitfalls. This will ensure you're prepped when it matters, but also, it'll build your solo travel confidence and resilience long-term."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Takeaway No. 4 - know that discomfort or loneliness can sometimes show up in solo travel, and that's OK. Put guardrails in place and decide which elements are non-negotiables for your own peace of mind, like that blessed airport transfer."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Takeaway No. 5 - be prepared to pivot. Things don't always go as planned, so go with the flow. And when you can't, don't be afraid to bow out."},{"author":"EDELMAN","text":"Takeaway No. 6 - make connections. When you forge those bonds with strangers, new friends and even with yourself on the road, you're never truly alone."},{"author":"SEGARRA","text":"That was reporter Amelia Edelman.

So we want to, like, stay within a threshold that feels manageable."]},{"begin":"934.960","end":"945.440","lines":["Experiencing discomfort, Cameron explains, is a normal and healthy part of the learning and growing process when trying something new, certainly including solo travel. It's important not to run from it."]},{"begin":"945.440","end":"974.920","lines":["So we want to expect to take a solo trip and feel totally fine and not feel uncomfortable or not feel fearful or not feel lonely. And the reality is, is those are really normal parts of being human. And solo travel, in whatever form you choose to take it, is such a great platform and space to challenge your humanness and to learn how to be with your humanness. If we want more comfort doing it, then we have to do more of it."]},{"begin":"974.920","end":"980.720","lines":["Yeah.

I got tired of myself. I'm like, oh, my gosh, like, I don't want to - I need to hear another voice besides my own. And that - for some people, that might manifest in a certain existential loneliness. And I think that's fine. I think use that to kind of push you to book a tour. The loneliness - you deal with it by just approaching it head-on because you should know who you are in these circumstances."]},{"begin":"1046.760","end":"1054.120","lines":["Joy says she has often been told she's brave for traveling on her own and pushing through those moments of discomfort.

But life is too short to sit around and have regrets about not doing something."]},{"begin":"1067.720","end":"1091.240","lines":["She recommends taking your time to sit with that discomfort or loneliness and giving yourself a lot of grace. Joy also recommends little luxuries within your budget when traveling solo, such as upgrading to premium economy for flights and prebooking reliable airport transfer rather than chancing it on public transport. That's especially true if mobility issues are something that makes you feel nervous about traveling solo."]},{"begin":"1091.240","end":"1120.040","lines":["That's a feel-good thing when you come back, to know that there's a guy waiting for you who's going to take you right to the door and drop you off. I'm still in pretty good health. I haven't had anything exchanged inside of me. You know, I've had no new knees or hips. So I'm fortunate that way, but I do have a little mobility issue. And, you know, when I was going to Iceland, I thought, oh my God. Will I be able to keep up? So it's just a comfort thing. And that's always going to be a part of the budget, is a ride to the airport and back."]},{"begin":"1120.040","end":"1131.040","lines":["Booking that nicer airport transfer or that comfier tour through a location where you're feeling particularly nervous or unfamiliar can be a great way to rely on others while you're traveling solo, says Cameron."]},{"begin":"1131.040","end":"1148.520","lines":["We never want to be only relying on ourselves or only relying on other people. We want there to be a nice blend and a nice flexibility between the two things.

And there's all of these cute couples, and I'm like, oh no. Now I'm going to feel like, should I be here with a man? Should I be here with a - with another person? That experience definitely made me feel like, OK, this is not for me."]},{"begin":"1192.360","end":"1210.520","lines":["The experience made Marquita realize that while she enjoys sharing the occasional white-tablecloth meal with others, she's more comfortable as a casual diner when flying solo.

And if so, you should have no qualms ditching them."]},{"begin":"1210.520","end":"1224.840","lines":["I really think that's the key to all travel. No matter if you're going by yourself or, you know, with a group, you got to move on. And if you can't move on, then you need to hop on a plane and get back home and, you know, take care of yourself. Period."]},{"begin":"1224.840","end":"1238.960","lines":["Cameron agrees and adds that all that preplanning you did before your trip should set you up for success when it comes to deviating from that plan.

You know, you can join people, you can talk to people or not.
