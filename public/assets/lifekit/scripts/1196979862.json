      "text": "Hey. What's up, everybody? Andrew Limbong here, in for Marielle Segarra. My first solo apartment sucked (laughter). It was in a basement in Washington, D.C, and it was small and dark and kind of muggy all the time, but the thing that bothered me the most about it - the thing that still bothers me today - was that the kitchen sink was so small, you literally couldn't fit a plate in it. Like, a lone plate had to go in diagonally, and not only that, but the faucet, for some reason, was extra long, and so in order to use the sink and not get water all over the floor, you had to shimmy it to the side a bit. I did not like being there, but I also didn't do anything to make it better. I figured, why bother? Who cares? I'm just renting, so there's no point in putting any effort into the place. It's an attitude entirely based on some imagined future where I'm in the perfect place where I could really let my aesthetic dreams flourish, but there really is no reason to wait. On this episode of LIFE KIT, reporter Adwoa Gyimah-Brempong is going to walk us through some ways to make those apartment decor dreams a reality - right where you are."

      "text": "Right now, I live in a cute little one-bedroom apartment. It's the eighth long-term lease that I've had in my adult life. For all of that time, I've been a renter, and I'm not alone. As of 2017, when I was on my sixth apartment, there were more renters in America than there had been in the previous 50 years, and as of 2022, about half of American renters were what's known as cost-burden. That means they're paying more than 30% of their income in rent. People are renting for much longer than they have in the past, twice as long as they were in the 1970s. Within that group is a subset known as forever renters - folks who don't own their homes and, by circumstance or by choice, maybe never will. So what's a forever renter to do? A tiny kitchen that might not bother you in a six-month lease may be a lot more frustrating after two years, and you may not be overflowing with cash to solve the problem. Enter DIYs. My current apartment has bright walls, a ton of storage and plenty of places to hang plants, bags and lighting. None of that was here when I moved in. I did it myself. I spend a lot of time in this space, so it's important that it feel good to me."

I hated the overhead light in my place so much - so much. It wasn't until I brought in some funky lamps and could really turn off the big light that the room came to life. So think about what's bothering you about your space - the lack of storage in the closet or nowhere to put all your books - and focus on that first. Contractor lights aside, my apartment was pretty great when I moved in. I have three criteria that are non-negotiable - good light, top floor, no carpet. But several people I spoke to told me they took much bigger risks when selecting their spaces, including Chyelle Milgrom, also known as fbmarketslut on Instagram and TikTok. She finds gorgeous vintage pieces, as is or for restoration on Facebook Marketplace. Today, her apartment is lovely. It has huge windows and a ton of cool projects, including painted doors and a glass brick wall. But when she first viewed it..."

I have, old videos on my Instagram of what it looked like previously, but there was, like, green and red walls. There was, like, fluorescent blue murals somewhere. It was really a [expletive] mess, and it was, like, absolutely horrific."

    },
    {
      "author": "POE",
      "text": "You really need to start with a swatch. You bring those home into your space, not the fluorescent lighting of the store. Then you move on to a paint sample. Also the different walls, even in your room, are going to look different."
    },
    {
      "author": "GYIMAH-BREMPONG",
      "text": "I found that one out the hard way. My living room faces south onto a balcony. So the space gets very different amounts of light throughout the year. It's brighter in winter when the sun is low enough to shine directly into the room. So the little patch I painted didn't show me what the whole wall would look like when it was done."

The time you're going to spend in the room."

      "author": "GYIMAH-BREMPONG",
      "text": "The other nice thing about paint is that it's reversible. Many DIYers will say that for some projects, it's better to ask forgiveness than permission. But with repainting, if you're thorough, it will look like that pink wall was never there. Amanda has a series called \"Renter-Friendly Reality Check,\" where she brings viewers along on the takedown process of a project. I asked her how she handles paint situations that need a more serious rescue. Some landlords do leave paint in an apartment for minor patches, so you could always ask. But if you're flying under the radar, here's how to make it work."

      "text": "I would say the most important things are the sheen, obviously, and the color. And so even if you color match perfectly, but you get the sheen wrong, the place that you repaired is going to stick out so bad. I would say when your paint is peeling, like, maybe your project has gone wrong, pulling up like more than an inch of a swatch, like something bigger than a quarter, that is going to give you the best surface so that you can take it to your local hardware store, and they have a system that will paint match it with a computer."

My favorite is a two-foot-tall table lamp shaped like a miner from the San Francisco gold rush. Just like my Ikea entryway, once you start looking at form instead of function, there are so many great places to find things to upcycle. Thrift stores and architectural salvages are a great source of raw materials. When you find a good one, become buddies with the people who work there. Do they get their best deliveries on a certain day? Find out when that is. I have a rule that I don't spend more than $100 on anything other than a couch or a bed. So for online shopping, I'll figure out what I want, set some Craigslist alerts and wait.

It kind of shows you that I'm a real person and I've got, like, real friends and whatnot and, like, embarrassing profile pictures versus someone who, like, just opened their account last year and has one picture and no friends. Kind of shows you who might be a scammer. Also, if they ask for, like, Zelle upfront, then they're probably a scammer. Try not to pay anyone anything until you see the item in person."

So takeaway six - when assembling what you need, get creative. Whether it's an actual thrift store, a reuse market or an Ikea hack, think big about how to find what you need for a project. And that's not just materials, but all the tools you need to get your project done. My DIY starter kit has five elements. First, a measuring tape. And I carry a small one with me at all times, just in case I come across something that could work for an ongoing project. Then a small set of basic tools like screwdrivers, pliers and a hammer. A level is important for anything that's going to have a flat surface. A drill, drill bits, and drywall anchors are probably my most used tools."

And lastly, those paint supplies, but there are also larger supplies that you may not need to keep on hand. A lot of public library systems have tool-lending libraries that members can use. There are also maker spaces with larger things like saws, and some hardware stores will rent out tools as well. I've done plenty of projects I probably wouldn't try again as a renter - stapling fabric to the wall instead of wallpaper, for example. But finding a beautiful solution to what started out as a problem can be a real source of pride."
