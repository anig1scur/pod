You just need to figure out what that means for you and put a plan in motion. On this episode of LIFE KIT, reporter Kyle Norris is going to help you do that. And by the way, your plan does not have to involve a party or balloons or cake or even other people. This is a choose-your-own-adventure moment."

There were games, plastic prizes, cheeseburgers and cake and Coke. And we wore these little paper crowns. It felt like there were no adults around and one teenage employee supervising us. We were wild. Free. And the thing about growing older and becoming an adult, is that no one teaches us how to celebrate our birthday. Let alone have a happy birthday. Tamar Hurwitz-Fleming knows what it\u2019s like to have special birthdays and not so great birthdays. Her 18th birthday, as a freshman in college, was a doozy."

I was really excited for the phone calls to come from my family wishing me a happy birthday. But the phone calls never came. And I woke up that morning and I realized, without anybody around me, my birthday was going to be up to me. And I kind of got excited about that. Like, oh, I don't need to depend on anybody. So I took the day off classes. I walked through town. I bought myself a birthday gift, which I had never done before, and really, it was such a lovely day for me."

One thing I might do is ask my friends to send me voice memos where they share a personal message for my ears only."

Everybody's happy for people on their birthdays. I don't know about you, but every time I know it's somebody else's birthday and they let me know, I'm happy for them. I'm happy to give them positive energy."

And that's takeaway No. 3. She says, buy yourself something you really want. Decorate your place with a birthday banner. Go through some old photos and display pictures from your childhood - whatever feels good for you. I have a friend named Adjoa Gemma Brenpalm (ph) who calls herself a birthday aficionada, and she says birthdays are a chance to celebrate how far you've made it.

Take the day off if you can and choose what you want to do just for yourself. You don't have to include other people, but small steps as you start to get used to having positive, happy birthdays from year to year to year can really develop beautifully over the years."

And if there's some serious stuff going on in your life when your birthday rolls around, Tamar says that's a chance to show yourself some compassion and that it's OK not to feel happy or like doing much. Birthdays mean we're one year older, and if you have feelings about that, Tamar says, think of it this way."

Takeaway No. 2 - practice good communication skills by telling other people what you'd like to have happen and how they can specifically help with that. Takeaway No. 3 - do some special birthday things just for you. Takeaway No. 4 - if you are not feeling your birthday, that's OK, but figure out a special thing that you want to do, and it can be tiny. For me, I might light a candle and close my eyes, sit in the dark and with my headphones, listen to one of my favorite songs. The day you were born was the day you showed up on the planet."

      "author": "HURWITZ-FLEMING",
