This nap may mess me up later, but there is nowhere else in the world I'd rather be right now, and it is happening. I don't even set an alarm. And then I wake up, like, four hours later, feeling groggy, often a little sad and guilty for having slept so long so close to my bedtime."

The first is our homeostatic sleep drive, also known as sleep pressure, which builds from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to bed. The other is your circadian rhythm. You probably remember this from science class or any of the other many great LIFE KIT episodes on sleep. But if not, here's a quick refresher."

Everything in your body runs on a clock. And all these clocks are overseen by a master clock in your brain. And this master clock can do its job the best when it knows what time it is and it can sort of keep time on a consistent rhythm."

That's when you throw back a Diet Coke right before naptime, so by the time you wake up, you feel extra energized and ready to go. And there are studies that back up this practice.

      "text": "OK, let's recap, softly and slowly, just in case any of you are using this podcast to settle down for your early afternoon snooze. Takeaway one - naps are supplemental to your nighttime routine, not a replacement. Takeaway two - not everyone needs a nap, so if it's not happening, don't stress it. Takeaway three - aim for naps that are C-E-B - consistent, early and brief. Takeaway four - stop committing sleep sabotage. For the very best of naps, be intentional about all of your sleep. Takeaway five - daytime rest is crucial for nighttime sleep. Even if a nap isn't possible, make time for a daily ritual of rest."
