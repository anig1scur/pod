  "intro": "Tipping requests are on the rise. Businesses that never seemed to ask for a tip, like fast food joints, are now asking for one. Here's how to deal with unexpected requests and more.A previous version of this story incorrectly said the company Square takes a \"chunk of your tip.\" A representative from Square says while they charge a fee based on the whole transaction, including tip, the worker still gets the full amount of their tip.",

      "text": "To tip or not to tip, that is the question. Also, though, how much am I supposed to tip? Is this 24% minimum tip I'm seeing on the screen, is that really the new minimum? Is it OK to leave less? Can I tip on my card, or am I supposed to tip in cash? Also, I didn't even know I was supposed to leave a tip at this kind of a business. And where is my tip even going? Does it go to the person who's actually helping me, or does it go somewhere else? Tipping, it is complicated. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith in for Marielle Segarra, and today on LIFE KIT, we take a look at tipping. The last couple years have seen a whole lot of talk and back and forth and emotion about tipping. One of our wonderful producers, Audrey Wynn, said at her local coffee shop, the tipping situation is especially intense."

      "text": "For the record, it is legal to ask for a tip, but truly, I kind of feel this customer's pain. Tipping has become very fraught. And a lot of this has happened because tipping is a pretty intense social interaction, not always as intense as it is at Retrospect, but still often quite intense. And ever since the pandemic, tipping expectations have changed a lot. And now there's just a lot that customers don't know. And the answers are not always so obvious. So today on LIFE KIT, tips for tipping. We lay out the facts and answer some of the big questions so that you can feel good about where you're putting your money and where your money's going in our brave new world of tipping."

However, it is the system we have, so it's worth figuring out how to navigate it. But tipping in the U.S., it's just very fraught. And it seems like everyone has developed their own new system in the last couple of years. In fact, we asked some of our LIFE KIT listeners what their system is, how they navigate this wide world of tipping. Here's what they said."

      "text": "For over seven years as waitstaff and/or bartender, you know, far before I became an economist. But it certainly is one of the reasons why I write so much about it, because it's confusing, people don't really get it and it's really quite important."

      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "Sylvia says the most important thing to know when deciding how much you want a tip, location, location, location. Where you are, the state you're in, makes an enormous difference. And that is our first takeaway, know what the tipping and wage situation is in your area. For one thing, every state has its own minimum wage. There is the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but some states have minimum wages that are more than twice that. What gets even more confusing is that there is also a sub-minimum wage. That is a wage that some service workers get paid and it is below minimum wage, like our listener Danielle and her whopping $2.83 an hour. The idea is that the workers earn a sub-minimum wage and then customer tips make up the difference, get those workers up to a minimum wage."
    },
    {
      "author": "ALLEGRETTO",
      "text": "People don't understand this two-tier wage system that we have in the United States. We have minimum wages and then we have sub-minimum or cash wages paid to workers who are tipped. And at the federal level, the sub-minimum wage is $2.13 an hour."
    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "$2.13 an hour. That is the federal sub-minimum wage, and that amount has not changed since the '90s. Now, some states do have a higher sub-minimum wage, and other states do not allow businesses to pay a sub-minimum wage ever, so the tip that you decide to leave for your coffee and pie means something really different for a server in Washington state, where the minimum wage is more than $16 an hour and there is no sub-minimum wage, versus a server in Tennessee where that person might be earning $2.13 an hour and really counting on the extra change you leave for your pie and coffee."
    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "And I think this is one of the reasons why there is so much emotion around tipping from customers. Because tipping is presented like an option or a courtesy, like, oh, if the service was great, leave a tip. But in some cases, that money, your tip, is vital to the income of that worker. Like, the Tennessee server is really counting on your tip to be able to pay their gas bill. Economist Sylvia Allegretto says, yeah, this system is confusing and it is complicated and it puts way too much on the customer as far as knowing what people are getting paid in different jobs in different states."
    },
    {
      "author": "ALLEGRETTO",
      "text": "So here in California, we're one of seven states that do not allow for a sub-minimum wage. So we don't have tip workers making less than the regular minimum wage. So tips in California are actual gratuity on top of the minimum wage. If you're not tipping in a state like Maryland, for instance, Maryland has a $3.63 sub-minimum wage. So if you're not tipping somebody in Maryland, they're likely not getting up to the regular minimum wage. So that's the case that - where tips are not necessarily gratuity, they are in part a very large share of the minimum wage."

      "author": "VANEK SMITH",

The information is totally free and updated all the time, but there are also a lot of other sites where you can get this information. But even when you know what the minimum and sub-minimum wages are in your state, it can still be hard to know who is earning a minimum or a sub-minimum wage. It's not always so clear. Often, a sub-minimum wage will get paid to bartenders, servers, but also people who work in car washes. It can just be really hard to know. So when in doubt..."

      "text": "Shubhranshu Singh is a professor of marketing at Johns Hopkins Business School, and that is our takeaway number two. When in doubt, just ask the person who is serving you. Shubhranshu has a lot of practice doing this because tipping in the U.S. has always seemed kind of mysterious to him, because where he grew up, tipping was not a thing."

      "text": "So Shubhranshu taught himself to ask questions, not just about minimum versus sub-minimum wage, but also asking people, hey, do you get to keep your whole tip? For instance, the business might not be tipping the person that you are interacting with, the person who is serving you and who you might think your money's going to. So ask. And if you just really don't feel comfortable asking, Shubhranshu says you can always go old school and just tip in cash."

    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "And takeaway number three, as much as you can, ignore social pressure when tipping. There is a lot of social pressure around tipping, especially when you are looking at the person who is asking for the tip. But Shubhranshu says your decision to tip should not be completely based on who is looking at you. In fact, he says right now most people do not tip their Uber or Lyft drivers or leave a tip for housekeeping at their hotel."

      "author": "SINGH",

    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "And often those workers really count on tips, but they are not looking at you when you are making the tipping decision. Now, for businesses where you're not even sure if you should be leaving a tip - and this has happened a lot since the pandemic, some business you don't even expect to ask you for a tip is suddenly asking you for a tip - Shubhranshu suggests leaving a 10% tip. He says even asking for a tip is often an indication that the workers there are not really getting paid a minimum wage, so it is good to err on the side of leaving something. And one thing to watch out for - screen pressure. Shubhranshu says in a lot of businesses, they have loaded a minimum tip of more than 20% - 22%, sometimes 24%. So there can be a lot of pressure to leave more than you want just so you don't hold up the line. But Shubhranshu recommends rejecting that pressure and feeling totally empowered to press that custom tip button. You know, push back a little bit on businesses who might be asking for too much."

      "author": "SINGH",

      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "So there they are. Our tips for tipping. Just to recap, takeaway number one - know the tipping and wage situation in the place where you're paying because that makes a huge difference, probably the biggest difference of anything. There are a bunch of free resources online around this. One is at the Economic Policy Institute. Takeaway number two - when in doubt, ask questions. Ask workers how much of a tip they will receive or if their job pays a minimum wage or a sub-minimum wage. Just ask. Takeaway number three - try to ignore the social pressure around tipping. Think about who you want to tip outside of who is looking at you. Don't be afraid to hit that custom tip button. And you should feel fine about taking a minute or two to decide how much you want to tip."
