Maybe it's for work, maybe to get your kids ready for school or take care of a family member. Maybe you just want some more time to yourself in your busy morning to work on your hobby or take care of errands. Whether you hate the sound of your alarm forcing you out of bed or the idea of enjoying some peace and quiet in the wee hours just sounds lovely to you, this episode is for you. We'll explore what makes us morning and night people, how much wiggle room we have to shift our lifestyles and cover some tips and tricks to make the whole thing less of a chore."

      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "That's Dr. Katie Sharkey, an associate professor of medicine and psychiatry and human behavior at the Brown University Alpert Medical School. She says the problem with those studies is that night people are usually trying to fit into a world that's structured around getting up early. If your body doesn't let you fall asleep early enough to feel rested in time for your 9-to-5 job, of course your performance will be worse than someone who naturally falls asleep earlier."

      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "OK, now that we've busted the myth of early bird virtuousness, that brings us to takeaway one. Your biological clock doesn't need to limit you. We might think of ourselves as morning people or night owls, but you have plenty of room to adjust if you want to change your lifestyle."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",

    },
    {
      "author": "SHARKEY",
      "text": "Suppose your clock is 25 hours instead of 24. If you want to stay on clock time, you have to reset a whole hour every day. And so it's really easy for folks whose internal clock is long to get off quickly. You stay up late Friday night, you stay up late Saturday night, it's really hard to get up on, you know, on Monday morning at the right time."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "On the other hand, people whose internal clocks are shorter than 24 hours tend to be early birds. And if you feel like you don't fit into either of those categories, it's possible your internal clock lines up somewhere in the middle. Katie says age is one factor that determines where our clocks line up. Remember how you suddenly started sleeping in until noon when you hit adolescence?"
    },
    {
      "author": "SHARKEY",
      "text": "We think the biological clock undergoes a change during those teenage years. So that's sort of a developmental place where you might see a lot of night owls start to appear."

      "text": "Sunlight helps to regulate the biological clock by shutting off something called melatonin. Melatonin is a chemical that's released naturally by the brain that tells the body it's time to be asleep, essentially. And so when you're exposed to bright sunlight, it shuts that off, sort of telling the body, hey, it's time to be awake."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "Afifa says turning on bright lights when you wake up can help get your body feeling more awake and ready to get going. If, like me, you live in Alaska or somewhere where it's dark in the mornings, eating breakfast or working in front of a broad-spectrum light box can be helpful to simulate sunlight and trick your body into feeling more alert. Conversely, at night, you don't want to keep blasting your eyes with bright lights that will signal to your body that it's still daytime, especially if you're trying to go to bed early enough to get enough sleep for an early wake-up."
    },
    {
      "author": "SHAMIM-UZZAMAN",
      "text": "Any exposure to light - right? - is a big no-no during that wind-down routine. So using a computer, you know, which is projecting light really close to your face - that can actually have an effect. Especially blue light can have an effect in shutting off the melatonin. So we want to avoid light exposure."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",

    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "Maybe that means going for a morning run instead of an evening one, doing a few minutes of yoga in your living room or just some jumping jacks when you get out of bed. Getting moving after your alarm goes off will also help your body adjust better to being awake. Katie and Afifa agree that whatever you do, it's really important to keep a relatively consistent schedule. Even making sure you're eating at about the same times relative to when you go to bed can make a difference."
    },
    {
      "author": "SHAMIM-UZZAMAN",
      "text": "The regularity of the schedule is very important. The regularity of the bedtime and wake time definitely are very important. What you do during the daytime in terms of, you know, what timings of your meals - if you can keep them consistent, that's really ideal, especially in a place where you have a big difference between the summer months and the winter months in terms of light."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "If you're waking up early for work, it's tempting to sleep in way past your normal wake-up time on your days off, but that can have serious negative impacts on your ability to wake up early during your days on. Aim for a compromised schedule on your days off where you wake up, at most, a couple hours past your workday wake-up time."
    },
    {
      "author": "SHAMIM-UZZAMAN",

So even those people who work at night, you know, if they're night owls and they work at night, they don't want to flip their schedule around on the weekends and, you know, be sleeping at night and trying to stay awake during the day 'cause that's going to be hard for them. They're always going to be struggling."

    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "So first up, naps. Try as we might to go to bed early enough to grab a solid seven or eight hours of sleep, waking up early often means that we wake up sleep deprived. Sleep doctors call that a sleep debt. And just like credit card debt, that has to get repaid at some point for your body to function well. If it doesn't, you might end up suffering more serious consequences of sleep deprivation."

      "author": "SHAMIM-UZZAMAN",

You know, if you couldn't get the full amount of sleep overnight, napping during the daytime might be necessary. But what you've got to be careful of with napping is if we nap too late, too close to bedtime, then it'll make it hard for us to go to sleep."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",
      "text": "Aim for midday and mid-afternoon naps, and try to keep them under an hour. Sleep studies show naps even as short as 10 minutes can make a difference. Naps taken judiciously are one way to repay your sleep debt. Katie says it's useful to be intentional about planning ahead with your sleep schedule, especially if you know you need to be up late the night before an early wake-up call."
    },
    {
      "author": "SHARKEY",
      "text": "So maybe I am going to then make sure I grab a quick nap the next day, or maybe I'm going to take a preparatory nap. If I know I'm staying up really late, maybe I will try to rest for 20 minutes in the middle of the day to stay awake."

    },
    {
      "author": "SHARKEY",
      "text": "So caffeine is a great stimulant, but it definitely interferes with sleep, and so it needs to be used judiciously. And I don't know - people are not very good about that. I've had many patients who are very disappointed when I point out that they're drinking sort of a hospital-grade dose of caffeine on a daily - you know, when I say things like, well, that's the amount of caffeine they would give you if you came to the emergency department with a migraine. They would start an IV and give you that six cups of coffee. So what if we cut back on that a little?"

Maybe you made sure to exercise in the morning, you timed out your light exposure, turned off your phone an hour ago, and now you're in bed unable to sleep. Afifa says a well-timed melatonin supplement could help prevent this situation."
    },
    {
      "author": "SHAMIM-UZZAMAN",
      "text": "We don't want to use high doses of melatonin for these kind of things. It's actually - we found that lower doses of melatonin work even better than the higher doses do for readjusting our biological clock. Usually, we produce melatonin naturally when it gets dark. But then, also, it starts to, you know, increase to the level we want it to before sleep about two to three hours before we actually fall asleep. So, you know, you want to take the melatonin two to three hours before the desired bedtime."
    },
    {
      "author": "GEORGE",

However, it's worth pointing out that making early mornings more tolerable, particularly if you're a night owl, is a process. It's going to take some time to get used to a new schedule. Our world insists that we be on all of the time, which can make it tricky to adjust to a schedule that can make you feel like you're out of sync with the rest of the world."

Then remind yourself why you're doing it. Feeling well-rested with more time in the morning means you'll feel and perform better during the day.

There might be some days where your schedule gets thrown out of whack or you had to stay up late working at your computer and you can't get to sleep after. You definitely shouldn't push yourself too far, Katie says. If you need the rest, take it. Sleep deprivation can be really dangerous, especially because when you're sleep deprived, you're not a good judge of your own impairment. A significant sleep debt could translate to falling asleep at the wheel. So Katie says it's always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to getting rest. But apart from that, be kind to yourself. Some mornings might be rough at the outset, but Katie says if you're doing a decent job keeping your habits in check most of the time, you'll be able to handle an occasional bad night of sleep here and there."

If you or your elderly parents, for example, have trouble unscrewing the push-and-twist style of childproof caps, like, for example, on a bottle of bleach, take the cap off, put it on a hard surface and give it a whack or two with a hammer. The outside part of it should crack, and you can remove it, and the inside cap is just a normal screw-on cap. Obviously, don't do it to things children can still access, but for elderly people and in our house with no kids, it's great, and I do it on, like, everything I buy. Have a great day."
