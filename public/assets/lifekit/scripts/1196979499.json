  "intro": "Losing a sibling is a unique and often overlooked kind of grief. Many grieving siblings aren't given the same level of support as their parents or caregivers after a loss. But a sibling's grief can be just as powerful and potent. NPR health correspondent Rhitu Chatterjee shares advice on how best to cope with grief \u2014 and honor a sibling's memory.",

      "text": "But a sibling dying is devastating. About 60,000 children in the U.S. lose a sibling every year, and 8% of young adults in this country lost a sibling either in childhood or young adulthood. When you consider the rise in suicide and overdose deaths in the U.S. in the past decade, that means more young and middle-aged people have suffered the death of a sibling. And yet, grieving siblings are overlooked so often by those around them that researchers have a name for them - forgotten mourners. That's why Annie wrote her new book, \"Always A Sibling: The Forgotten Mourner's Guide To Grief.\""

And our first takeaway and Annie's first advice for grieving siblings is this - remember, you are allowed to grieve, too. Your whole family, especially your parents, are, of course, devastated. But that doesn't mean you put yourself last when it comes to grief."

      "author": "SKLAVER ORENSTEIN",

      "author": "CHATTERJEE",

      "author": "SKLAVER ORENSTEIN",
      "text": "A lot of the siblings I spoke to who said things like, the loss felt like something that happened to my parents. And they hadn't processed it at all themselves. And it's because they put themselves on the back burner, and everyone else put them on the back burner."

      "author": "MEGHAN BRITTON",
      "text": "People didn't know what to say to me. They would always refer to my parents. You know, they would say, like, oh, be strong for your parents or, how are your parents doing? So it was always kind of in terms of my parents."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Meghan felt everyone was indirectly telling her that her pain didn't matter and that there was this messaging that you had to suddenly grow up and be the emotional caregiver. That can be a lot to take on, and it pushes your own grief into the shadows. There's even a name for this. Psychologist Julie Kaplow is with the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute in Houston, Texas."
    },
    {
      "author": "JULIE KAPLOW",
      "text": "This is really considered what we would call disenfranchised grief, where there is a lot of focus on the parents, for good reason, who are grieving very overtly over the loss of their child. There is less of a focus on the siblings who are left behind, and we know that their grief can be just as powerful and potent as the caregiver's grief."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",

Meghan Britton, who you heard from earlier, says the thing that helped her the most after her brother Andrew died was a present from her mother's best friend."

And I want you to write down how you're feeling. I want you to write down the experiences because you need to get this out. You need to capture these things."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Meghan says even now, decades after her brother's death, she values that gesture and how much it helped her process her grief. Journaling is also a tool that Annie recommends. She suggests not just writing down one's feelings, but also memories of your sibling because that is also a big part of healing from loss."

    {
      "author": "SKLAVER ORENSTEIN",
      "text": "A lot of siblings feel like they have to be the record keeper and the memory keeper, that they need to keep this legacy alive, and that's a lot of pressure. And if you feel like you have to hold it all in your head, it's all you're going to think about. And so a lot of those things, putting them down on paper, even if you never look at them again, never read them again. Just capturing them is really important."
    },

      "author": "CHATTERJEE",

      "author": "BRITTON",
      "text": "Even though the person is gone, talking about them is still really helpful. Yeah, they're not here, but their memories are still here, and they were here. And who they were still matters because they still exist in our memories, and they still exist in our heart."

And that's the goal of takeaway number three. Annie says because her brother's death was sudden and traumatic, she struggled with prolonged grief disorder, which meant it took her years before she was able to get to a place where she could find a way to feel connected with her brother again. But eventually, she says..."

And then I had this very funny experience that I write about in the book where she said, you know, look for a sign, like, ask him to show you blue flowers. And I did, and I felt like such - I felt so ridiculous in my head, being like, Ben, can you show me blue flowers?"

      "text": "So whether or not it's real or whether or not there's an afterlife where people really can, you know, send signs, I think it's kind of a moot point because what matters is that when these things happen, when these certain songs come on, or I see certain things, I feel like I have my brother again. And it's such a wonderful feeling that it doesn't matter if it's a placebo effect."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Maybe you can find that feeling when you hear a certain song, or you're doing something you used to do together, like maybe going to a baseball game. When you have these moments, take a pause and think about your sibling and feel that sense of connection with them. Now, so far, we've talked about things that the person who's lost a sibling can do to process their loss, but grieving can often feel like a lonely process because people around you may not know what to say or do to support you. Annie, too, felt that way after her brother died."

      "text": "And you can also show your support in other ways by just being present in their lives, dropping off dinner or helping them with chores or anything they need help with and don't expect anything from them in return. This is especially important in the early stages of grief. And lastly, Annie says not to expect a grieving sibling to ever get over their loss because most carry it with them through their life, as do others who have grieved for any close loved ones. Here's something Annie said about grief that stayed with me. It's from a book called \"Grief Is Love\" by Marisa Renee Lee."

I will love my brother unconditionally for as long as I live. And for as long as I live, that love will be unrequited. And that's why you don't get over it. It's why you don't move on because I'm never going to stop loving him. So I'm never going to stop missing him. And I don't want to stop loving him."

Give yourself permission to grieve and start by acknowledging and accepting what your sibling meant to you."

    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Takeaway number two - to process your grief, get everything you're feeling and thinking about out of your head and into the world. This includes sharing memories of your sibling. You can do so by journaling or talking to people willing and able to listen. You can also use art and music to express yourself."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Takeaway number three - try to find ways to feel connected to your sibling and keep them present in your life long after they're gone. It could involve having conversations with your sibling in your head, or it could be looking for signs that remind you of them, or it could be doing things your sibling and you did together or something they loved to do. When you have these moments of connection, cherish them."
    },
    {
      "author": "CHATTERJEE",
      "text": "Takeaway number four - this is for anyone who knows a grieving sibling and wants to support them in their grief. Know that checking in on them and acknowledging their pain can make a big difference. You can sit with them as they cry. Know that you don't need to say anything to make them feel better."
