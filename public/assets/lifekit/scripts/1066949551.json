And then he suddenly goes, I see there is a big Asian contingency here. And then it went quiet because people were like, why did you bring race up out of nowhere? He's reading the room, but in the wrong way. He just saw the room and just said what he saw. It's like a kid when they're playing - like, I spy, you know, a spider; I spy a door; I spy the sky. That's what he did. I spy Asians. You know? And then he - to try to save himself, he went, and I love the Asians (laughter)."

And there are lots of stories like this. Maybe it's the bridesmaid who treated the toast like a roast and insulted the groom's weight and appearance. And it doesn't just have to be a wedding toast. It could be the retirement party where a colleague gives a 45-minute speech detailing every moment of their friend's career while the champagne bubbles go flat. Or of course, there's the classic drunk speech that could pop up at any event - rambly, incoherent, a little embarrassing for everyone involved."

So once you've got your sweet, inoffensive anecdote, there's a pretty simple formula for your toast.

But to move from one lake to another, we had to do this thing called portaging, where you get out of your canoe, you strap heavy bags of supplies on your back and then you hoist the canoe over your head and hike with it to the next lake. One portage was very long and very uphill, and it took me about five minutes of walking with the 40-pound canoe cutting into my shoulder blades before my whole body was sweating and shaking. I started swearing. My friend Samantha walked alongside me, saying nice things like, we're getting closer; I bet we're almost there. And just after I assured her that I could not do this anymore, we rounded a bend, and there it was, a pristine, glistening lake. We ran into the water, letting the cool relief wash over us."

Well, friends, my wish for us in 2022 is that we finally turn that corner to find the sweet relief of a cool lake. And even if that doesn't happen, I'm wishing you a friend like Samantha, trotting alongside you, telling you, you're doing great; we're almost there. So with that, let's raise our glasses. Cheers to 2022."

      "text": "OK. So let's recap how to give a toast using Ramona J. Smith's very handy guide. T - tell a story. Think about a memory or an anecdote that will engage your audience. O - stay optimistic. Don't just tell a sad story and leave it at that. And you want to watch your tone. Generally, avoid topics such as sex, politics, religion, race. A - be authentic. Don't try to be the funniest or smartest person in the room. Instead, use this opportunity to say something genuine and sincere. Vulnerability helps people connect with you. S is for speech. Your toast is a speech, so practice it. Read it aloud to someone you trust. Have someone like it over. When delivering your toast, look for someone in the audience who's engaged. Good vibes go a long way. And last but not least, T - timing. All our experts agree - keep it short and sweet. How short? Two to three minutes max. And time yourself beforehand to make sure it's not too long. Finally, our bonus takeaway - don't drink before a toast. Once you're done speaking, sure. Go for it. But alcohol won't actually help make you less nervous beforehand, and it could make you sloppy."
