      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, my coworker and I are secretaries at a doctor's office. We've worked together for over a year, and I considered her a friend. But a few days ago, I got a text message from an unknown number with a screenshot of a review that said I was rude to patients and that she is kind and compassionate. The text was also sent to our supervisors. The very next day I had to work from her desk. When I logged on, I found proof that she had created a fake email and written the review. I confronted her, and she denied it. But the next day the review was taken down. Should I let my supervisors know about her underhanded misdeed? Or should I just move on? Signed, Front Office Frenemy."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "Ooh, so good. Well, there's a lot to unpack there, right? You know, the first thing I appreciate is that they had a conversation with their friend. You know, if you value a relationship, it's important to have the conversation, which many people avoid. They just kind of keep it in the back of their mind and don't have a conversation at all. So definitely hats-off to the individual who went and had the conversation."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "But, you know, when it comes to the outcome - and the individual said, I didn't write it, I'm not responsible for it - after seeing evidence on the computer, you know, for me, there's two things. One, I try to assume and give our relationship the benefit of the doubt of, OK, I'm sitting at her computer. Who else might have been using this computer, right? And sometimes, our emotions sweep us over so quickly that it's hard for us to pull in all the facts. Ask yourself, what else may I not know about this scenario that I should consider? - to make sure that you're well-rounded in your thought process."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "Now, I think it's really important to bring that to your supervisor since they've already been, you know, kept in the loop on the situation. Because you could find yourself in a scenario where if your friend really didn't write that email, who's breaking into computers around the office, right? Like..."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "OK. I'm hearing, pause first - don't jump to conclusions; don't assume the worst about people; you know, consider all your options. And if you are going to escalate it, do it in a professional way. Be able to back yourself up. Be able to cover all of your bases. Those are all great things. I have to be honest with you. I was not assuming the best of this situation. My first reaction to this was, like, wow, there was just such a level of commitment to this con that was really striking to me. Is that also your instinct, your inclination, that it's likely, possibly, more likely than not..."

    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "And it's easy to do that in the office, too, especially when you have, like, a really close relationship with someone and then they catch you off guard and you see something like this. But if you find yourself at the end of the day saying, I don't believe them, then, I think it's important for you to also have that conversation. Again, and it depends on if you value the relationship or not or if you want to have closure. Slowing down and just saying, hey, you know, I can't get this scenario out of my mind, and it's really making me feel as though, you know, our relationship has been fractured as a result. And open the space for dialogue."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "You may find yourself, which - I've had a situation where the person was like, oh, well. Right? And then, we just called it quits for the relationship. But then, you have situations where the person is fighting for that friendship and says, no, no, no. You know, what can I do? Like, how do we repair and move on from here? But we do have to acknowledge - you have to acknowledge your own personal feelings. And if you really feel like you were betrayed by this individual, it's going to impact your working relationship, nonetheless. So I think you have to do the work to know what narrative you're telling yourself and how you want to engage in that relationship moving forward."

You know, sharing personal information, you know, with this individual wouldn't be something that I want to do because they're looking for, potentially, information that they could use. If I found a pattern of behavior - right? So keep in mind the historical context. If something happened like this last year and the year before, like, if it's a yearly occurrence around review time - right? - you need to pay attention to that so that you can use all of your general wisdom about the nature of this relationship. Because most of us, there's not a lot of people that I could avoid at work, you know, that - I got to get my work done, you know?"

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Keep an open mind where you can, but keep your eyes open, too. And professionalism, respect for the workplace at all times - I like that. My final question for you is about the supervisors and management in this space. It sounds like they aren't cultivating a super healthy work environment here. There's all of this going on. Do you have any feedback to offer for the supervisors in this situation? What's their place in all of this?"
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "Yeah, you know, I think attitude reflects leadership, right? And so when you see that there is maybe conflict or a lot of disorganization, oftentimes, it is coming from behaviors that people are witnessing at the - from their leaders as well. And so, you know, I always say that we're social learners. We learn how to behave in organizations based on how we're watching other people behave. Maybe the culture is about getting up to the top and at - by all means necessary. You know, those things are cultivated at the leadership level and held accountable at the leadership level."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "And so my advice to the leaders in this scenario would be to really lean in, you know, really think about their own team dynamics. You know, are you fostering healthy workplace relationships? What does team building look like? What does trust really look like or not look like within the team? As a leader myself, I would be asking myself a lot of those questions and thinking about how I could not brush this under the rug, but definitely lean into this as a great opportunity to highlight what is acceptable behavior on our team and what is not."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Yeah. Attitudes are contagious. One follow-up here. Let's say Front Desk Frenemy does all of these things - you know, talks with the frenemy, and they deny it all, talks with a supervisor, hits a brick wall there. What can our letter writer do when they feel like they've hit dead ends and just have to move on?"
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
      "text": "When you've exhausted every avenue and you've done your part - right? Like, you've held people accountable. You've raised the flag. You've said, here's an opportunity. And now you've done your work. The unfortunate thing is you can't do the work for other people, right? I can't make someone be truthful. I can't make a leader lean in more. I think the world goes round because we all have a part to play in this. And I think if you do that, you can rest assured and say, hey, I've done my part. I've had difficult conversations with both my leader and this individual. I've shown that I care. And so when it's time to put it to rest, it really is just mentally telling yourself and acknowledging and celebrating, look, most people could have ignored this. I've done my part."
    },
    {
      "author": "WILLIAMS",
