      "text": "Hey, there. Andee Tagle here in for Marielle Segarra. There is so much preparation required for a new baby. As your belly grows, so too does the checklist of all the things you need to do to protect that future little one, to babyproof every corner of your home and your life. From prenatal vitamins to ultrasound appointments, finding the perfect car seat and signing up for infant CPR. But what we don't think about as much is how to safeguard our relationships, how to protect parents-to-be from the monumental change that a new baby brings to a household."

      "text": "That's parent relationship educator and coach Aaron Steinberg, who introduced me to the idea of babyproofing your relationship. He actually teaches a whole course on the subject because it's a pretty widespread need. According to one study, nearly 70% of couples become dissatisfied in the relationship in the first three years of having kids. It's not hard to understand why that might be."

      "text": "Those little spats you get into now and then, that perpetual fight about your monthly budget, all the ways your partner gets under your skin. Yeah. Definitely not easier to deal with when sleep-deprived in a house full of dirty laundry and with a tiny, demanding new roommate in constant need of attention and care. But the hard stuff doesn't have to push you apart."

      "author": "STEINBERG",
      "text": "What babyproofing your relationship is to me is that you're able to use every moment of tension and conflict and difficulty that you face in early parenthood as an opportunity to become closer and more connected, better people, and better partners, so that instead of leaving the early parenthood stage feeling really far apart and disconnected and like you don't know who the other person is anymore, and maybe that you don't even like them that much anymore, that actually you feel more in love, more connected, more on a team, and even more attracted to each other."

First, we'll talk about ways you can prepare your relationship before the baby's born. Then we'll walk you through strategies for adjusting and readjusting once you've brought Tiny home. From how to think about fairness and the domestic workload to learning to grow together as individuals, as a couple and as a family."

So make sure to give that a listen after this episode if you want more advice in that arena. Now, with any of these sticking points, Shy says do what you can to find compromise and resolution before baby gets here. Shy's a big proponent of couples therapy, which can help give you a blueprint to fall back on when things get stressful. From there, and I know it can be difficult when there's so much ahead to worry about, it's important to just enjoy baby-free life together as much as you can while you can. Go to that fancy dinner you've been saving up for. Get out and be with friends. Take all the bump photos and read all the books."

And it's a big undertaking. So start by taking inventory. This process is something Aaron talks about in his own babyproofing course. Like, write down an actual physical list of all the daily or weekly duties and responsibilities in your household, plus all the things you anticipate you'll need to do once Tiny's here. And be thorough. There will be feedings and diaper changes, of course, but there's also a lot of administrative work, invisible labor when a new baby arrives."

      "author": "TAGLE",

      "author": "TAGLE",

      "author": "TAGLE",

    },

      "author": "TAGLE",

      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "So if something, like, in the middle of the night, things, like, really go left, it seems like things are not able to get back on track, my mom knows that she's on duty tonight.

    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "So set a schedule and a method for debriefing. This is important. It can look like whatever you want it to, maybe talking things through over Sunday breakfast.

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "And that brings us right to takeaway three - give yourself grace as you grow into your new roles. When you're in the thick of that newborn stage, just trying to figure out your up from your down and your left from your right, it's important to remember you're all new at this. It's not just your baby trying to navigate a whole new world."

    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "A privilege and a joy, absolutely. And also a huge, often bewildering responsibility. So it's OK to not feel OK. The birthing parent, of course, has a lot to deal with at this time - physically, mentally, emotionally. If you're going through it right now, I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can feel like your entire being is just like one giant raw nerve. That's a lot to handle at a time when all the focus is on that precious little angel. Shy heard this analogy once."
    },
    {
      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "Mom is the wrapper, and the baby is the candy. And once the candy's here, the wrapper gets discarded. It's horrible, but I think it resonates with so many birthing people because they're like, hello, I'm still healing. Like, no one's checking on me after my six-week appointment. Like, am I OK?"
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "And the non-birthing parent has their hands full, too, caring for the little one and caring for the person who gave birth. Finding ways to meet both of those needs while grappling with their own giant shift in identity is no small task. So you'll each have roles to play for the good of the team. For the birthing parent, Shy says the very best thing to do in the beginning is to just get in touch with your body and brain and take the time you really need to heal. As best you can, don't push it. If you're feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the basics."

      "text": "Do as much as you possibly can. I'm going to make as much food as I possibly can, wait on you hand and foot. In that beginning stage, I changed every diaper. I'm going to do every little tedious thing that needs to happen around our house as much as I can. My wife breastfed, and in the middle of the night, she would feed our baby, and then she would go back to sleep, and I would be responsible for changing the baby if it needed a diaper change, burping the baby, getting the baby back to sleep, right? 'Cause that's what I could do."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "All this to say, new parenthood is a heavy burden for both sides. So try to support each other's learning curves. And remember, you're in it together."
    },
    {
      "author": "STEINBERG",
      "text": "A super common relationship opt-out is, oh, well, the baby prefers you - right? - or you're better at that. And this is a really sticky point that I speak back against a lot 'cause it's, like, being a parent is scary for all of us, right? It doesn't matter your gender. It doesn't matter. It's just scary."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Which leads me to takeaway four - reach out. Lean on your partner and your people to get through the tough stuff. When you're in the thick of it, it can be really easy to get lost and feel alone in the overwhelm. Like you're the only one who doesn't know what they're doing. Don't give in to that feeling. Shy says just acknowledging your growing pains, naming the discomfort where you see it can do a lot to help you stay connected with your partner."

    {
      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "I know that, like, I'm struggling. I'm having a hard time with healing and navigating and managing this new identity. How are you doing? Because you're, like, taking a lot of the load in terms of cooking or the other chores. And I know I'm not super helpful right now because I'm not very mobile. What is this like for you? I think creating space, first and foremost, for them to express where they are and share where they are is really important."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Another helpful practice to try is employing a signal word. The one in my house was pineapple, though I couldn't tell you why. It was our quick, no shame, no questions asked way of saying it's time for a change of guard."
    },
    {
      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "For someone else to step in and for you to, like, take the space to do whatever you need, whether that's going to get a lactation cookie or whether that's taking a nap or taking a shower, using the bathroom by yourself, right? Like, whatever that is, it gives you the space with minimal words to just say like, I can't be the person fully responsible for this baby right now, and that's OK because I trust you, and I trust the other people around and, like, I know the baby will be in good hands."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Speaking of other people. Leaning on your village to the extent that you're comfortable with that in the early days is a good idea, too. Shy says new parents can sometimes find themselves surprisingly isolated in the postpartum period. Well-intentioned friends and family might not reach out for worry that they're bothering you. So don't be scared to ask for what you need."
    },
    {
      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "And that doesn't mean you need to have, like, brunch on the calendar every weekend, postpartum, right? But it does mean that you have some sort of, like, check-in time or some communication with your friends around, hey, even if you don't hear from me, I would love to know that you're thinking of me by sending me a text or asking if you can come over and drop off food."

      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "I think people want to feel seen always, but especially when it feels like everyone around you is kind of, like, caught up or swept up in the, like, holding-on experience of what a new baby is. I think the little things of saying, like, hey, I see you, I notice you. Thank you, and I appreciate you."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "But of course, not everything can be resolved with pleases and thank yous. And it can be really easy in those stressful moments to turn on each other. That brings us to our final takeaway. Takeaway five - learn to fight fair. It's not about competition. It's about connection. In new parenthood, when there's always so much work to be done and everyone's overburdened, it can be really difficult not to keep score. Aaron says you don't have to turn away from feelings of resentment or pretend they don't exist."

Like, hey, I don't want to be doing this. But when I hear you ask me to change a diaper, and I'm literally recovering from just having given birth, I want to just be like, dude, I just gave birth. Can you just do it for me? You know? And it's like, there's a way to connect with you in that."

It's not going to be our highest capacity, most grounded, most skillful time in our lives. But I think the huge mistake that people make is they let time fake heal all wounds. And time doesn't heal all wounds. It just buries things. And then that same thing is at the ready to come up later when some negative thing reminds you of it. So I say to couples, do not sweep things under the rug."

Here's where I know that I kind of went off the rails, or, like, this is what really triggered me that made this conversation, like, escalate from my perspective. And this is what I think will be helpful for you moving forward. All of this is way easier said than done. I recognize that.

      "text": "It's a trite therapist-y thing, but feeling heard and understood really does matter. And sometimes the thing you think you actually need just dissipates when you feel that connection with your partner."

      "text": "Twenty-two minutes where you then get interrupted and can't get through the whole check in, and you're leaving some emotional thing hanging to me is better than not trying at all. A half-finished conversation where you at least said, I'm sorry I said it to you that way last night. Here's what I wish I could have said, that gets interrupted is better than nothing at all."

So spend what you can on each other because being able to weather the hard stuff together is what will help strengthen your relationship and define this brand-new little family of yours. You're a team. And that spirit of teamwork..."

      "text": "I think it's the thing that gets you through any other thing. The aspiration is you feel more connected, more in love, more like a team as you go through early parenthood. Some days, some weeks, some months, that looks like you're just holding on for dear life to the connection that you have and then taking the opportunities you have to come back to each other when things get less crazy."

      "text": "OK, fellow parents, let's recap. Takeaway one - get your relationship on solid ground before baby arrives. That means make time for those date nights, yes, but also find the answers to the hard questions and get on the same page about your goals and values."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Takeaway two - parenthood is one part planning and one part flexibility. So create a game plan for dividing up domestic duties and then get ready for it to change."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Takeaway three - when baby arrives, remember, you're all new at this. Take it slow and embrace your new roles."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Takeaway four - reach out. Do your best to support each other's learning curves, and don't be scared to ask for help when you need it."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Takeaway five - it's about connection, not competition. When conflict arises, see it as an opportunity for closeness with your partner."
