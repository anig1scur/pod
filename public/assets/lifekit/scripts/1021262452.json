I should be making dinner. I should be breastfeeding. I should be throwing in a load of laundry. Do it with me. Breathe in and out. One way to proactively tackle what matters most - set up a game plan. That's our second takeaway. It'll take some intentional action and some forward-looking planning, but it can really pay off. Think of it as an investment in future you. You can start with a family mission statement, Nicole says. If you work in a big company, your organization probably has a clear summary of its purpose and objectives. Essentially, you want to do something similar by defining your family's goals and values. For those women with partners, studies show that couples squabble more after the arrival of a baby, so don't put off getting on the same page with your other half."

Asking where do we think we may need more support from both parties and being very clear with that, then we can come back and say, if this is the vision we want for our family, maybe we need to make certain things non-negotiable. Like, hey, Mom; you need to get at least an hour day to yourself. Hey, Dad; it's OK. Maybe you do have a standing date with your friends once a month or something, you know, so that it can feel equal."

It's never too late, she says. Adding that no matter what your family looks like, maybe your kids are older or you're a single mom, you can make a family mission statement. Now that you've sorted out the expectations at home, it's time to build your support squad because the transition into motherhood can feel incredibly lonely. Pria recommends identifying the helpers."

But even if you had a textbook pregnancy and birth, Pria says it takes time to adjust to your post-baby body. Studies show that it can take six to nine months to fully recover from childbirth, not the arbitrary six-week checkup with an OB or midwife. For some women..."

      "author": "ALPERN",
      "text": "I think this is where a lot of the guilt comes up for new moms - is that they feel bad about doing things for themselves. Even if it's as simple as taking a shower sometimes, I say it is good modeling for your child to show them that you are important enough to take care of yourself. So you have to think about self-care as kind of, like, fueling up your tank. You got to go do it so that you can bring your best self to parenthood."

Things won't fall apart if you take a few moments for yourself. Nicole suggests taking at least five minutes in the morning and another five in the evening to check in with yourself. The goal is to organize the thoughts in your head as you figure out your new role and make them more manageable. This is a necessity, she says, because if you're completely consumed by the baby, that little voice in your head will start wondering, what about me?"

And so we have to be intentional with bringing ourselves back to finding at least a little something good in the day."

You can try joining an affinity group for parents based on common interests like art or yoga. There are also social networking apps for moms that let users swipe up or down on profiles just like dating apps. In fact, making mom friends is often compared to dating because it can be awkward.

Remember you are still the same person. Caring for a baby day and night in that first year may make you feel like you've lost your old self. But eventually, as you get the hang of things and become more confident in your role, you'll start to recognize the person you were and have always been, Pria says."
