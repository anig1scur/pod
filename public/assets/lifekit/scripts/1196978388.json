      "text": "You're listening to LIFE KIT from NPR. Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. OK, so picture this - it's the holidays. You're having dinner with the family, and you can feel a storm brewing. Your brother-in-law starts to needle you about what you're eating or not eating. Two of your cousins have started just lightly shouting at each other, or your aunt is asking your sister yet again when she's having kids. You know, families fight, especially when they're all together under the same roof and especially if people are drinking, even though combat is probably not the reason you showed up. What if we approach this differently? On this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to share some tools you can use when conflict arises during a family gathering."

      "text": "All right. So like I was saying, most of us don't go to family gatherings spoiling for a fight. We may go out of obligation or guilt, but we're still hoping to connect or to feel joy that day. If you know that your family's holiday events tend to turn into verbal brawls, you can prepare for that by getting clear on your intentions going in. Remember; the only person you can control is you."

      "text": "That can be answered in a multitude of ways. Maybe the most important thing is I spend time with my one cousin who's going through a terminal illness and the other people don't really matter to me in this particular event. Or maybe it's I really want to connect with my elder over cooking certain things. I maybe really want to be lazy and watch TV on the couch and kind of not engage and not lead today, all of it cool."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Whatever your why is, that will be your anchor and something for you to come back to if dinner gets tense. OK, so that said, when conflict starts to bubble up, maybe grandma is reminding your mom of her divorce and that is still a touchy subject, you have the option to not engage. Takeaway one - you're allowed to avoid conflict. Celeste Headlee is a journalist and the author of several books, including \"We Need To Talk: How To Have Conversations That Matter,\" and she says here's a good place to start in these moments."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Conflict avoidance is often framed as cowardly, like you're hiding from an important conversation or a moment of growth. But if you don't have the time and energy or you just don't want to engage with someone about this topic over Christmas dinner, that is fine."

      "text": "One way to stay out of the fray during family holiday events is to keep yourself busy. Maybe you love kids, and so you're going to help change some diapers. You know, give your brother and his husband a break. Or maybe you're going to do the kitchen cleanup or sit with your great aunt who has dementia. Those are helpful things to do, and they're also absorbing activities, too. Also, if you know there's a family member who always tries to fight with you or to criticize your life choices, it is OK to avoid them. You know, say hello and goodbye, but don't sit right next to them at dinner."

Deflect, set a boundary, or redirect. These kinds of responses are a small way to engage but keep it moving. Say you have a family member who's peppering you with intrusive questions that you don't want to answer and you want to get that point across, Nedra Glover Tawwab is a licensed therapist and author, and she says one option is to just say that directly."

You can interrupt with something that needs to pull people's attention just to give them a little time to take a breath. And sometimes that's all that people need."

      "text": "Oh, it's been so great to see you. I've been really wanting to talk to you about that. Could we do it over lunch tomorrow? Or, actually, your opinion sounds really interesting to me. I've never heard that take before, and I've been really curious about X, Y, and Z. Could I pick your brain about that at another time? And that way it's less about let me quiet you and push you to the corner and it's more about, actually, I really want to engage you, and you matter to me. And I'm going to push it over here because it's more appropriate."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Now, sometimes you don't want to have a debate, but you do want to voice an objection. Maybe a family member says something racist or misogynistic or otherwise harmful. Amy says it's not our responsibility to change this person's mind, but we may want to tell them I don't agree. Some things you could say, I'm not sure how you meant that to come across, but that was really difficult to hear, or, I don't appreciate that kind of language. That sounds like a harsh judgment of X group of people, and I don't think that's a fair statement. I don't know what information that statement is based on, but I'm hearing a lack of understanding and compassion here. Or it makes me sad or upset to hear you speak so harshly about other people like that."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK, another situation that could come up - maybe a family member is constantly putting you down. You're allowed to draw a line. I mean, think about it. If this were a friend's party or a workplace event and somebody was treating you in the same way, how would you respond?"
    },
    {
      "author": "HEADLEE",
      "text": "Family doesn't mean a ticket to abuse. You get to decide how people speak to you and what's over the line. You know, you can say, listen. You can't speak to me that way. That's my boundary. And if you do, I'll leave. And then you follow through on it."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Now, maybe you're not the target, right? Somebody else at the table is. Takeaway three - figure out when and how to mediate or run interference. Now, it doesn't have to become your job to referee or to bring every conversation at this event to a happy conclusion, but you can step in if a family member is being picked on. And you may be able to help bring tense conversations to a better place at least. Let's say you're sitting around at dinner and everyone is ragging on your cousin because they don't have a job. Amy says this kind of thing can be nuanced."

      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "author": "LEW",
      "text": "I really like doing things in kind of a sly way. So if it's that person and I need to go, like, refill the dinner rolls, then I'm going to say, oh, hey, so-and-so. Could you come help me grab this thing? And I can check in with them really quickly. And I also give them a nice, easy exit out of the situation itself."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And then, be curious."
    },

      "author": "LEW",

      "author": "SEGARRA",

    },
    {
      "author": "HEADLEE",
      "text": "You need to own your objection and say, you know, it's - I feel uncomfortable; this is bothering me, not, hey; you're picking on that other person or you're upsetting them. Own it. Say, this is upsetting me to listen to this. Maybe we can talk about something else."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "text": "That might be a time where you want to pull in some other adult. Is your grandmother's sister there, you know, that can step in on her level to say something? Maybe you need to go get Aunt Catherine and say, hey. You know, they're in there arguing. Do you mind stepping in to say something so that energy isn't coming from her granddaughter?"

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Naming what you see can be really helpful. OK, so we all agree - no fisticuffs. But if you are going to debate - takeaway four - do it respectfully and thoughtfully. Nedra says if this is your inclination, you'll want to ask yourself first, if we have this conversation today, can we talk about this topic and then move on?"

      "text": "If having the debate will ruin the rest of the evening or the rest of the day for everyone, it can be a bit selfish, right? Now the tone of the holiday has shifted. If you're able to say, no, this is what I think about this thing, and you all have some respectful back-and-forth dialogue, then you can do that."

      "author": "HEADLEE",
      "text": "So if you remove that pressure of feeling like this conversation you're going to have is about either winning the conversation or convincing them with all your facts and statistics - if you let go of that, it really lowers the stakes."

      "author": "LEW",
      "text": "So, like, oh, I really see that this and this and this is really important to you, or, I see you put a lot of thought into X, Y and Z, or, it makes sense that you would see it from this angle because of this reason - not because I'm agreeing with them in what their reason is. I can just understand where they're coming from. And that way, that other person really feels validated."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "If you notice during this conversation that you're getting worked up or yelling and you don't want to be, reel it in."

      "author": "GLOVER TAWWAB",
      "text": "I'm realizing that this conversation that started off really respectful is getting too heated, so I'm going to back away from the conversation and allow some other folks to talk. Or I'm going to, you know, maybe simmer down some, and we can talk about it a little bit more later. So talk about what you can do, and show up with your behaviors first."

I know I should have left at four because now I am arguing with someone in the kitchen. So you know yourself better than the others there. And they may think, oh, you can withstand a bit more. And it's like, no, this is enough for me. And, you know, I'm going to leave now."

      "text": "So if possible - right? - if possible, if I genuinely do care about this person, I want to kind of throw it in there not to be super-flowery or super-sugary in my language.

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "You heard the lady. Recap time - you are allowed to avoid conflict. Conflict avoidance is often framed as cowardly, like you're shying away from a moment of growth or opting out of an important conversation. But if you don't have the time and energy, it is OK to protect your peace. If you don't want to completely avoid conflict but you want to minimize it, keep your responses short. You can try deflecting, setting a boundary or redirecting. If you're not directly involved in a conflict but you see one brewing, try mediating or running interference. Figure out how you can be supportive. You know, if your family member has their phone on them, try texting them to check in or give them an exit. Hey, so-and-so. Want to help me in the kitchen real quick? Lastly, if you're going to engage in a debate, do it respectfully and thoughtfully. It helps to approach these conversations with genuine curiosity and a willingness to listen."
