      "text": "So the attitude towards buying things in our household was, do you need it (laughter), because I'm one of five daughters. And so my dad was, by force, pretty frugal. So I really grew up very utilitarian. Like, is this something I truly need? And I learned not to - not that I didn't crave having kind of, like, the extras and the bells and whistles, but I learned how to manage without having those things."

Women - especially women and people of color have been left out of the financial conversation for so long. And so when it comes down to it, I am a teacher. And so as a teacher, I also believe myself to be a good - a student - a student of life, a student of finance. And when I learn a thing, I teach a thing, and I do so specifically for this audience because I know how I felt when I was struggling to learn for myself."

The dog's barking. You have a headache going. And all you want to do is kind of turn your brain off and shop for a new pair of fuzzy slippers. I know I'm not alone here. I know we've all had this kind of day. Tell me, why do we impulse shop, and how do we stop it?"

So I give myself a weekly, if not monthly, budget of where I can buy things within that budget. And that helps me to kind of, like, get that cool glass of water, put that Band-Aid on, but without breaking the budget."

So what we've done is that we have cut off the cable - yay - and we've switched out that amount that we were spending, and that's our impulse shop budget. So we're not actually spending more, but we're getting more for the dollar that we spent."

    {
      "author": "ALICHE",
      "text": "Well, you know it's so easy to say, save, save, save. But here's the thing. If you've done the right things already, you are allowed - meaning that if your savings account is pretty well stocked, and even if your savings account is not fully funded, let's say - I always say I want you to have at least three months, ideally up to six months, of your lowest denominator expenses. So that's your rent, that mortgage, the things you absolutely have to pay for - insurance - right? - so three to six months of that. So even if you don't have three to six months of that, but you do have a savings plan where you're automatically saving toward that every month and you find yourself with an extra $20, certainly you can put the extra $20 toward that saving."

    },
    {
      "author": "ALICHE",
      "text": "Yes. So many times - and many people are in that position. Many people don't have enough money at the end of the month. So I always say, you either have a spend-too-much issue, or you have a don't-make-enough issue. And so first I want you to address, which issue do you have?"

But for many of us, it's a - I actually have more discretionary expenses coming out of my budget every month, so I have a spend-too-much issue. And so what I'm wanting is for you to get clear on, what are the things that really make me happy? What are the things that really bring me joy? And I have this little sticker on top of my computer that says, need it? Love it? Like it? Want it?"

And most importantly, is this a love? So a love is long-term joy - joy that's going to last you a year or longer. Likes are short-term joy. That means less than a year, I'll have forgotten about this thing. And wants are just instant gratification, where not even a day later I'm not going to be interested in this thing."

And if I don't have enough at the end of the month, then I really shouldn't be wasting any money on likes or wants. So that is something - 'cause it's a muscle that you have to practice. Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? So you can start to rethink the way you spend your money."

Especially in these days and times, I also don't want you to start training your child that they need expensive things to be entertained. And so being strategic with the things that you purchase to make sure that, yes, they are adding to the joy and the happiness of your child, but that you're not teaching them that this thing must be expensive because it really doesn't have to be. And so if you don't have the excess funds, get really creative by rehashing the toys that your child already has."

      "author": "ALICHE",
      "text": "So there is a thin line between frugal and hoarding. It depends. If you are like my family growing up - a family of seven - you know, five kids, two adults - then, yes, buying gallons of hand soap might make sense. If you are family like I am now, a small family, it might not really make sense to buy in bulk, especially on things that are perishable that are going to go bad soon."

    {
      "author": "ALICHE",
      "text": "So what you're going to look at when you do buy in bulk is the unit price - right? - so - because sometimes you think that you're getting a deal because you're buying so much of it. But it's going to tell you per quart, per piece, how much is that thing actually costing me? Compare that to the regular price for the regular size of that item to see, are you really saving or are you just buying more currently?"

My husband and I have bought living room wallpaper, materials to stain the kitchen cabinets. We also have plans to refinance and refinish our basement, including adding another bathroom. While I want to believe this is all worthwhile spending and will increase our home value, I worry we could end up sinking too much money into our home."
    },
    {
      "author": "ALICHE",
      "text": "So, Alicia, you are absolutely right. So what I would do first before I did any home improvement project is that I would have - or get on the phone a realtor, right? A realtor is going to know best where you put your money, where you're going to find the biggest return on investment. And so that's what I did. My husband and I recently renovated the home that I'm in now. We bought it. It was a total fixer-upper. And I had a realtor who was also a designer help me decide where to put the money. Like, did we really need super high-end backsplash? I don't know. Are you going to get your money back from there? So she literally walked us through room by room and said, this is where you spend a little extra; this is where you can spend a little less."

So something you can do a friend of mine did, which I thought really brilliant, is to call the credit card companies and say that you lost your card because sometimes you'll say, oh, I'm going to cut up my card, but you know what happens when we go onto Amazon. It's right there (laughter). No, no, no. Call your credit card companies. Hi, I lost my card. So what they're going to do is they're going to reissue you a card. And when it comes, you're going to cut it or put it away. But you know that that card's not stored in your phone or your laptop. So you have - if you're in a ditch and someone gives you a shovel, which is your card, if you don't want to keep getting deeper and deeper into the ditch, you have to put the shovel down. You have to put your card down."

It helps greatly instead of having to wiggle and fight with the pillow. All right. Good bye."
