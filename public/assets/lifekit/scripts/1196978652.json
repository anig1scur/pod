The secret to real, authentic connection? I mean, it's not such a big secret. We have all had those amazing conversations at one time or another, felt that buzz when your ideas are really in sync with a colleague, or that amazing feeling when you have a conversation with your partner and you feel like they really get you."

It's not that introverts can do it better than extroverts or vice versa.

      "text": "Yeah, absolutely. So when we really connect with someone in conversation, when we are sort of on what you might refer to as the same wavelength, what's interesting is it's reflected in our bodies and our brains. So right now, we're having a conversation even though we're separated by hundreds of miles. And yet if we could measure this, what we would see is that your eye pupils and my eye pupils are starting to dilate at the same rate. Our breath patterns are starting to match each other. Our heart rates are starting to match each other. And even more importantly, if we could see inside our brains, what we would see is that my brainwaves are starting to look like your brainwaves and vice versa."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "So, Takeaway 1, communication is connection. We tend to think that the goal of a conversation is to make a point or say your opinion. But Charles says that's not a good way to judge the success of an interaction. Instead, in order to really connect, aim to have what he calls a learning conversation."
    },
    {
      "author": "DUHIGG",
      "text": "A conversation is successful if I understand you and you understand me. And what's really nice about that is that if you go in with this attitude of wanting to have a learning conversation, where my goal is simply to learn how you see the world and to share with you how I see the world so you can learn my perspectives, then it takes away all this pressure. I don't have to convince you to vote for my guy. I don't have to convince you to support my issue. I don't have to convince you to support my team. Instead, what I want to do is I want to understand how you see the world. And there's tactics that help us do that. One of my favorite ways of doing this, particularly if you're having a conversation amid conflict is something known as looping for understanding. And what it is - it has three steps. You should ask someone a question, and some questions are more powerful than others. You should listen to what they say. And then step No. 2, you should repeat back in your own words what they just told you. And then step No. 3, and this is the one we usually forget, is you should ask them if you got it right. The reason this is so powerful is because particularly when we're in conflict, the other person doesn't know if we're listening or if we're just waiting our turn to speak. But if it's a learning conversation, a conversation where I really want to understand you, if I start proving to you that I'm listening, proving that I want to understand, and then asking you to make sure that I'm getting this right, that I genuinely do understand, both of us are going to trust each other more, even if we completely disagree with each other."

      "text": "Yeah, absolutely. So one of the best examples is how I came to this book, because I felt like I was having some communication problems in my life. And one in particular, a pattern that I found was happening again and again is, I would come home after a tough day at work and I would start complaining to my wife and I would say, you know, my boss is a jerk and my coworkers don't appreciate me. And she very reasonably would say, oh, you know, why don't you take your boss out for lunch and get to know each other a little bit better? She would try and solve my problem. And instead of listening to her, what I would do is I would get even more upset. I would say, you know, no, I want you to be outraged on my behalf. I want you to be - to support me. And she would get upset because I was acting irrational. She was giving me good advice."

      "text": "And so when I went to researchers and I asked them about this, what they said is like, well, here's the problem. People tend to think of a discussion as being about one thing. It's about my day, or it's about Jimmy's grades or where to go on vacation. But actually every discussion is made up of multiple different kinds of conversations. And in particular, those conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets. There's practical conversations, where we're solving problems or we're making plans. There's emotional discussions where I might share how I'm feeling, and I don't want you to solve my problem. I want you to listen and empathize. And then there's social conversations where we're talking about how we see each other in the context of society. And other people see us. And they said, look, when you were coming home, you were having an emotional conversation. You wanted to talk about how you feel. And your wife responded with a practical conversation. And both of those conversations are totally valid. But because you were having different conversations at the same moment, you couldn't really hear each other."

What does this other person want and need, and what do I want out of this discussion? There's certain kinds of questions that are special. These are known as deep questions. To figure out what everyone wants from a conversation, you should ask deep questions. And a deep question is something that asks about people's values or beliefs or experiences.

And they say, I'm a lawyer, you can ask, oh, you know, what made you decide to become a lawyer? Like, did you always want to be a lawyer? Do you love your job? Those three questions - they're asking that person to talk about their values and their beliefs, the experiences that led them to law school, whether they enjoy going to work each day, what they enjoy about it. They're easy questions to ask. But when we respond to them, we describe so much about ourselves. And by listening closely to that, we can figure out where this person is coming from."

I wanted to be able to provide for my family. That person is in a practical frame of mind. They're having a practical conversation. But someone else who says, I decided to become a lawyer because I saw my dad get arrested, and I wanted to fight for the underdog. That person is in a more emotional or maybe even social state of mind. We should have a different kind of conversation with them. It's easy to ask deep questions, easier than we think it is.

And one of the things that's been really fascinating to me is how much my relationship with him has continued after his death. Now we're, you know, 45 seconds, a minute into a conversation and we're talking about something real, something where we can get to know each other and understand each other a little bit better.

They asked all the students to write down three topics that they thought they could discuss. This took like 10 seconds, right? People would write down, like, you know, this weekend's game and what TV shows I watch, just little dumb throwaway things. And then they went and they had conversations with strangers, and everyone would put the card away. Many of them would put it in their back pocket. And the topics they had jotted down often never came up."

And as a result, those discussions went much, much better. Oftentimes when we're thinking about talking to someone, when we're thinking about a conversation, particularly a hard conversation - right? - a serious one, we can get really anxious about it because we don't know how it's going to go. And if we just sit down and we just think a little bit, you know, I'm calling up my friend Greg, and I really want to find out, like, if he has any plans for this summer, and I hope that it's just an easy, light conversation. That takes four seconds for me to decide before I start dialing. But studies show it'll make the conversation go better. Because I'm prepared. I'm prepared for what arises. But I also know what I want, and I'm prepared to listen to what he wants."

They come home from school and, like, I go into auto mode sometimes where I'm like, hey, how was school today? It was fine. Do you have any homework? Yes. I - without even thinking about it, I start asking all these un-deep questions. And so now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to - before my kids get home, I try and think up, like, what's the question that I can ask my son that he actually wants to answer? And sometimes that question is things like, you know, who do you think is the best basketball player of all time? Which is apropos of nothing, but he loves to answer."

And I'm just wondering, like, Jasper - he seems like a really good friend of yours. Like, what is it about Jasper you like so much? Like, what do you admire about Jasper? When I think and try and come up with these slightly deeper questions, it's as if I've unlocked something in my kids, and suddenly they start telling me about why they like some of their friends and drama with other friends. And then we have real conversations, and then I can tell them about when I was a kid, which they're hopefully fascinated by and sometimes bored by. But it just takes, like, 10 seconds to come up with the real question as opposed to the, the rote question, which is how is school? Do you have homework? So I try and do that more."

But what Nick has found is that within three questions - between strangers, between close friends, between people who have nothing in common - within three questions, you can get to something real if you ask why.

They tend to ask 10 to 20 times as many questions as everyone else. But the questions are kind of throwaway questions. A lot of them are, like, you know, what do you think about that, or what happened next? So that we don't even hardly register them as questions. They tend to laugh more because they want to show us that they want to connect. But most importantly, they are authentic. So if you say something that indicates that you're struggling with something, they authentically listen to you and they might share something about themselves, or they might ask you a question about that. But they don't try and force something that's false. They don't try and imply that that they're curious, but the reason that they're asking what happened is because they really want to talk about what happened to them. And so the more that we can be authentic with each other, the more that we can listen to what we're feeling and thinking, the more paradoxically we get better listening and in speaking in ways that other people want to listen to us."

Takeaway two - understand what kind of conversation you're having with someone - practical, emotional, social - then match accordingly. Takeaway three - ask lots of questions. Remember, supercommunicators tend to ask 10 to 20 more questions than everyone else, and deep questions will build connection quickly. If nothing comes to mind right away, start with why. Takeaway four - be authentic. You don't have to be an extrovert or comedian to really connect with people. Just lead with your curiosity and don't be scared to be vulnerable. Remember, being a supercommunicator isn't just for the elite few."
