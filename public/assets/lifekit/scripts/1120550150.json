This kitchen is where all the magic happens. It's where Melissa Clark created, tested and tested again every recipe in her new cookbook, \"Dinner In One,\" which has 100 recipes that you can cook in one pot, one pan, one slow cooker, very easy-peasy."

There are recipes for miso-glazed salmon with roasted sugar snap peas, cheater's chicken and dumplings, even one-bowl cakes. Clark, whose New York Times column is called \"A Good Appetite,\" has written dozens of cookbooks. But this one is a little different. Nearly all of the recipes can be done in under an hour and without using all the dishes in the cabinet."

And traditionally, that's a really easy, great way to do a one-pot meal, but you can do almost anything in one pan if you - it's just a matter of paying attention to how long things take to cook and how you place them on the pan next to each other. So like, a typical roast chicken can be a one-pan, can be a sheet pan chicken, right? Or a pasta dish. Pasta, a normal lasagna - you could do the whole thing in a skillet, and then it just saves you boiling the pasta separately. You can do all kinds of things in a casserole dish, you know, in one of those 9x13s or a gratin dish. And you put the longer - the ingredients that need the longest time to cook in first, and then you add the ones that need less time later."

      "author": "CLARK",
      "text": "Exactly. So - and then there's also a mix of ingredients. You want to make sure that all the ingredients go really well together, right? You know, there's a saying - what grows together goes together. So you know, what I love to do is go to regional cookbooks from regions all around the world, right? So you know, let's just start with the United States. It's like, OK, well, so what grows really well in the Northeast together? What grows is really well in the South, in the Southeast together? What about the Southwest?"
    },
    {
      "author": "CLARK",

Let's go to regional Italian foods. Let's go to the south of Italy, right? You have mozzarella. You have tomatoes. You have basil and garlic. We all know that those things are traditional together and that they taste amazing. So you know, same thing going to different parts of Asia. You can do this anywhere in the world, and you get so inspired by just looking at what the traditional food ways are and how you can use them in your own cooking."

    {
      "author": "CLARK",
      "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, definitely, bay leaves are - you know, it's like if you're going to leave something out of a recipe, you probably don't need the bay leaves unless it's, like, a bay leaf-flavored stew, in which case, you know, they're essential - but for the most part. OK. let's talk about browning ingredients for a stew, right? So if you look at a typical stew recipe, you want to brown each cube of meat on each side. And they don't tell you this in the recipe, but you're going to stand there for half an hour browning those little pieces of chicken and meat. And that takes a really long time, so one of the first things that I skip is I don't brown all of them."
    },
    {
      "author": "CLARK",
      "text": "What I do is I brown one side really deeply because I want that flavor. You really want the brown flavor, but you don't need it on every single piece of meat or chicken. You get enough of it to give you this richness in your sauce, and then you can stop. So you can do maybe 50% of the browning work that you would normally do, and that's OK. And that's a technique that I use in this book. It's like, let's cut down on the time here and still get the same great flavor."

      "author": "RASCOE",
      "text": "OK. Any other thoughts on, you look at that and go, just forget that?"

      "author": "CLARK",
      "text": "Yeah, well, there's a lot of - yeah. So there's a lot of cake and baking recipes that I do this, too, for. So in the book I have a whole chapter on one-bowl cakes. And what I did in those cases is a typical cake recipe is you have your fat, which you beat air into. You have your eggs and your wet ingredients, which you mix in one bowl - so now we're already two bowls - and then you have dry ingredients, which is a third bowl. I have streamlined all of that by taking my inspiration from cakes that are made with liquid fat. And then, instead of beating your wet ingredients separately, you just beat them straight into that liquid because it's already a liquid. It's already a fat."
    },
    {
      "author": "CLARK",
      "text": "So you've got your butter, your melted butter or your olive oil in a bowl. You add your eggs and your yogurt or whatever your liquid ingredients are, your vanilla extract. And you beat them really well until they're smooth. And then, in the same bowl, you throw your dry ingredients right on top of it, and you don't even mix them in a separate bowl. And this just streamlines the process and it makes a one-bowl cake. You can mix up a one-bowl cake - it's like making pancakes. You know, it takes five minutes to just whip everything together, and then you bake it in a pan. And you've got this, like, easy after-work cake. And who doesn't love an after-work cake?"
