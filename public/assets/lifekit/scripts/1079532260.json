Maybe not, but we can do things to make it better. On this episode of NPR's LIFE KIT, we're going to talk about breakups. They come in all types, right? - slow dissolves, out-of-nowhere immediate endings, mutual breakups, maybe you were the breaker upper. It doesn't matter. They all hurt in some way. So we'll find out how to recover, heal and move on from heartbreak."

I don't mean that in an overly dramatic sort of, you know, put on black eyeliner and listen to The Cure sort of way. I mean, it actually hurts, according to Naomi Eisenberger. She's a professor of psychology at UCLA specializing in social neuroscience. And she says, when we're with our loved ones and they say nice things to us and we feel warm and welcomed, our brains light up in certain spots."

And she wrote a book called \"Breakup Bootcamp: The Science Of Rewiring Your Heart.\" She says as she was still reeling from her breakup, well-intentioned people would run out of patience and eventually tell her to buck up, to get over it, which is not super helpful."

And that is when we will make decisions that we can really regret. And when you are feeling sadness and anger and all of those emotions that come with grief and you are intoxicated, it will amplify whatever you are feeling."

And when you break up, even if on a cognitive level you know it's over, your body is in a state of shock. And it is wondering, where the heck are those love hormones? And so if you continuously go back on memory lane by either, you know, looking at old text messages or stalking their social media or calling them or meeting up with them, you're not allowing those old neural pathways to prune away."

And sometimes, we hold onto the pain because that's the last part of the relationship that we've got left, so it's better than nothing."

Orna Guralnik understands why the desire to do that is there. But at the end of the day, it just isn't 100% honest."

But ultimately, you don't want to get stuck there because it's a distortion of reality. It prevents people from learning more about themselves and seeing reality for what it is. Ultimately, it's not a good method."

      "text": "It's the same thing. They are in a fantasy. They're not living in reality. And so when that happens, I work with them on peeling the layers of that story. And they'll eventually see, oh, well, yes, there was this red flag. And, oh, yes, well - yeah. That happened. The sooner we can knock that ex off that pedestal, we can start working with reality."

      "author": "CHAN",
      "text": "One of the exercises we do is everyone writes down their breakup story. And they write it down as if they are catching up with a friend and telling them everything that happened. And then, I teach them how to separate fact from fiction. And we review all of the cognitive distortions - also known as thinking traps - so from generalization to black-and-white thinking, to being caught up in shoulds. And then they circle all of the cognitive distortions that are in their story. They then rewrite their story with just the facts."

    {
      "author": "CHAN",
      "text": "When we dig deeper, we realize that sometimes, we didn't even really like the person. And it's not specifically this lost ex, but it was the sense of abandonment that they have felt over and over again in their life. And the pain does compound. And that is that recycled pain. That is these patterns that are repeating over and over again."
    },

And you might be feeling guilty. I mean, if you use those insights well, then you will grow as a person. Shame-based thoughts have more to do with, I'm this or that kind of person. I'm a loser. I'll never hold onto anyone. I'm unlovable. I'm..."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's hard to understand. Like, because on the one hand, trying to grow, right? You can ask yourself very healthy questions - right? - about, like, am I - did I do this right? Did I do that right? But I feel like those can easily turn into shame-based sentiments, right?"

So maybe you feel sadness, and then you feel ashamed because you shouldn't feel sadness. And then what happens is you start feeling that emotion story. So I call it feeling the emotional monster. And those emotions, They want to stick around for as long as they possibly can, and they want to get as big as they possibly can. And its food of choice are your thoughts and your stories and your assumptions. And that's when we start ruminating, and that's when that emotion can stick around for hours, if not days."

And so in that case, you actually want to do opposite action. So your natural instinct when you're sad might be to just hunch over and curl up in a little ball and you want to do the opposite of that. You want to stand up tall and put your shoulders back. You want to put on a more high beat, positive playlist versus sad, depressing love songs. So in those moments, you need to look at what you're doing and ask yourself if it's going to make you feel worse or if it's going to help you pull you out of that state."

Another one, we know opioids are released when we're in close contact with loved ones.

You can also take that energy you'd spend of ruminating on your ex and funnel it into a new hobby or a passion of yours you want to get more fully invested in. Fill up your life, and eventually you'll be ready to move on, whatever that looks like for you, which is our fifth and final takeaway. Start dating again when you feel like you're ready."

But you might go and you're like, oh, OK, well, yeah, I didn't have I didn't have much of a connection, but it wasn't bad. And it was kind of nice to be able to to go out and meet someone new again. Then, yeah, I would keep going."

So give yourself some time to get over it. Two, don't focus on your ex. Don't villainize them or valorize them or try to get in touch immediately after for some so-called closure because it's just a way to hang on to the relationship."

That's OK, and nothing to feel shame about. But four, recognize when you're stuck in a feedback loop of sorts. And don't feed into it by blasting the five-hour-plus Spotify playlist literally titled breakup songs that hit hard, even if some of those songs do, in fact, hit hard. Instead, try energizing your body either through exercise or finding a new passion. And five, when you're ready, and if you want to, open your heart again and try going out on a date."
