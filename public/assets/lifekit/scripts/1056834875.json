Last year, my social media feeds were full of ads targeting me about fertility testing and egg freezing, also known as fertility preservation. It stressed me out. I kept thinking the longer I wait, the harder it's going to be for me to have a child. It's only now that I finally feel settled in my career and can look to the future. I know I'm not alone."

When I decided to freeze my eggs, I talked to my OB-GYN. I talked to friends. I Googled. So I thought I knew everything I was getting myself into. But I was wrong about almost everything. That's why I wanted to make a LIFE KIT episode on egg freezing. It's a deeply personal decision, and it's a privileged decision. I just want to note that this episode isn't going to tell you what to do. Instead, it's going to help you make the right decision for yourself."

The first question to ask yourself is, how important is it to me to have a biological connection with my children? If your answer is not at all, perhaps this episode isn't for you."

    {
      "author": "PERRY",

Without insurance, egg freezing can cost up to $20,000 out of pocket. That usually includes medication, doctor visits and the actual surgical procedure to remove the eggs. But it doesn't even include the storage fee you have to pay yearly for your eggs. So overall, it's a hefty sticker price for one cycle of egg freezing. Currently, 19 states require insurance companies to supply coverage for infertility treatments."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "And there are grants available through nonprofits that you can apply for, but there are very few of them, so don't rely on them. Some people end up taking out personal loans or borrowing money from family members. You know, savings is also an option. One savings tip I learned is that you can put money into a high-yield savings account. It's a savings account that has a higher interest rate return than a regular savings account. This way, your money can grow a little that's tax-free. But let's be clear. Freezing your eggs is privileged. Here's Bethea-Walsh again."

      "author": "PERRY",

When I got serious about freezing my eggs, I spoke to my OB-GYN doctor who recommended three different clinics and doctor names that specialize in fertility. Dr. Adeleye recommends finding a clinic or doctor's office that is safe and responds in a timely manner. It's also important to work with a doctor who you feel comfortable having a frank conversation with. No matter who you are, choosing a doctor can be hard, especially when it comes to such a delicate topic like fertility. Trystan Reese has advice on how to find a doctor that treats you respectfully."

      "text": "My only advice is to find an ally to call clinics in your area and ask them, hey, have you had training on using gender-neutral pronouns? Have you had training on working with people pre-transition or post-transition? And just listening hard to make sure that fertility centers and clinics - they want your business, and sometimes people know how to say the right things; that doesn't mean that you're going to be treated well. You know, and so I tell people, get an ally, ask your partner if they're not trans, ask a friend to call on your behalf and kind of ask them some questions to make sure they're really ready to support you through this process."

      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "After a few phone calls and casual meet-and-greets with a couple of clinics, I decided on my clinic and doctor. Then my clinic scheduled me to take a close look at my fertility. A typical check-in will start with an ultrasound of the patient's ovaries, where they look at their follicles, which are small sacs that surround the eggs. The doctor wants to see how many follicles you already have. Then you do a blood test."

    },
    {
      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "Takeaway No. 4 is prepare for the egg freezing cycle. One typical egg freezing cycle can range from 10 to 14 days long. During that time, you have to go to a lot of doctor's appointments to make sure the meds are working. I told my supervisors at work that I was starting an egg freezing cycle. That way, they could anticipate me missing work for the doctor's appointments. During the two-week cycle, you have to give yourself shots of hormones."

      "text": "Some people might feel some site reactions where the injections are. So you might get some bruising, some burning. That's pretty common."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "If needles scare you, you can ice the area beforehand so it's somewhat numb. Also, take deep breaths before you inject yourself. It will relax the area. During this time, you really need to take it easy so that you don't get something called ovarian torsion. It's when the ovaries twist and cut off the blood supply to them. So this means no vigorous exercise and no penile-vaginal intercourse. For people who are taking any gender-affirming hormones like testosterone, it's recommended to take a break as you prepare for egg freezing. But for some, getting off hormones can be hard and could trigger gender dysphoria. There can be mental and physical changes, such as changes in the voice and recurrence of menstruation. So Reese says..."

      "author": "REESE",

    },
    {
      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "There's not much data on what gender-affirming hormones could do to fertility, but one study showed that transgender men who used gender-affirming hormones and stopped a few months before fertility treatments yield the same number of eggs as a cis woman patient. Another thing to remember is that age plays a huge role in getting the right amount of eggs to freeze. During my cycle, I was so stressed that I wasn't going to harvest the right number of eggs to have a baby. Dr. Adeleye says that's one of the biggest stressors she commonly sees from her patients."

      "text": "Uncertainty is a big part of this process. And even with all the effort and money invested, no one is guaranteed to conceive this way. Research shows that most people will need to freeze 10 to 20 mature eggs. But that doesn't mean you'll have 10 to 20 babies. It depends on how many mature and healthy eggs you get in that cycle. It's a numbers game. The younger you are, the healthier your eggs will be. Data shows someone under 35 has about an 85% chance of having a baby with 15 frozen eggs. But if a 38-year-old freezes the same amount of eggs, that percentage goes down to 60% percent."

      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "Despite what you think, remember it's quality over quantity. Getting ready for the actual surgical retrieval is carefully timed out. You'll take a couple shots around 36 hours before the surgery. It's medicine that tells your eggs that they're ready to be fertilized. It's a same-day procedure, but you do have to go under anesthesia. Reese, the trans fertility advocate, says that the anesthesia can help with gender dysphoria if that's a concern. The surgery itself is pretty quick. The doctors will use a needle to extract the eggs. So no cutting, no stitches."
    },
    {
      "author": "ADELEYE",
      "text": "We actually guide a needle through the back of the vagina to the ovaries. So we remove the fluid from each of the follicles, and then that fluid goes through a tube. And then an embryologist will take that tube and look at the fluid under the microscope to identify the eggs, and they'll prepare them to be frozen."

    {
      "author": "PERRY",
      "text": "When you wake up, the doctor or team will tell you as soon as possible how many eggs they were able to retrieve. Only 70 to 80% of those eggs will be mature and healthy enough to freeze. Recovery can vary from person to person. You may bloat and have hormonal changes since you will no longer be taking medicine. If you can, you should take a couple days off work so you can adjust. The day before my surgery, I cleaned my house, had fresh sheets on my bed and cued up my favorite shows and movies. If you don't have any help at home, I highly recommend this so you can just focus on resting. Another tip to help with recovery - have a heating pad on hand at all times. It helps if you feel sore after."

We do know that an egg freezing cycle can take two weeks plus recovery time after the retrieval, so it's good to ask yourself, what life am I going to have during the process? Some tips I have - lean on your support system. Ask your friends to bring you dinner, take a long walk with you or even send you a funny meme. Also, get some good sleep and try meditation to manage your stress. Stress levels could be high during the process because you just don't know what the outcome could be. Angela Bethea Walsh, the psychologist, says control what you can control. Stay in the present."
