How do you ensure your financial agreement doesn't harm your relationship? There are no hard and fast rules around lending money. Expectations may depend on culture, financial status or even your marital status. Advice on when to give \u2014 and how to say no.",

LIFE KIT is no stranger to tough, uncomfortable conversations that you maybe want to put off for as long as possible, especially when it comes to money and when it comes to relationships and when it comes to mixing money and relationships. But today, we're going to cover a conversation that can outright end friendships."

I have to give, whether it's to religious institutions or to friends or to others. Is this what helping means? - 'cause that can't be it, right? That's not altruism. That's self-hate."

So you've checked your own finances and decided you are not in any position to be giving anyone money. How do you say no? Or maybe it's more like, how do you say, no, but I still care about you? Takeaway three is if the answer is no, offer other ways to help. All right. There's no sugarcoating that this is going to suck. If someone is coming to you, asking for money, it is probably not their first option. They're probably in a bad situation and don't see any other way out. They're vulnerable, and you turning them down is going to hurt. Wendy De La Rosa had to have a no conversation with an extended family member."

It's to say, I understand that you're in a tough financial spot. So let me try to do everything that I can that's still within the boundaries that I can to help you.

      "text": "This is what people don't understand about co-signing. When you co-sign, you are not a back-up borrower. You are on the hook for that loan as much as the primary borrower. So if they miss one payment, they coming after you because they coming after the person who got some money. And so that's what people don't understand. So when you co-sign for a loan, you just bought yourself a car. And when you're on the hook, it is on your credit profile. So let's say you co-sign for a loan for someone. Now you need a car. They're going to look at it and say, well, you already got debt on here for a car, you know? And that could prevent you from getting a loan, or it could make the loan that you now need more expensive because it's now on your credit report. And so I just think it's a dicey area. It's a hard stop when it comes to co-signing."

      "text": "All right, recap time. When it comes to lending money to family and friends, takeaway one is do not think of it as a loan at all. It is a gift. Do not give any money you can't part with, which takes us to takeaway two. Give out of your extra. Make sure your budget is straight before you even think about helping friends and family. And you, for whatever reason, might be tempted to stretch yourself to help - right? - because people did it for you."

      "text": "Your budget can be a concrete thing to point to as your boundary when it comes time to say no, which will be a tough and uncomfortable conversation. But takeaway three is if you say no, find other ways to help that don't hinder your own financial security. This can mean prepping meals or running errands but also getting into the guts of their budget and helping them walk through tough questions, which is something you should be doing even if you offer to gift them some money because takeaway four is be proactive. If you know your buddy is going through a big life change that usually comes with a big bill. Check in on your friends ahead of time because asking for money involves a lot of shame and guilt and pride, and you want to catch that person before they're even more underwater in late fees and debt."

      "text": "Takeaway five - ask for details. Look at their budget. See their spending habits. If this feels intrusive, just remember that this is the sort of thing banks do. And why should you be any different? You can use this moment to use yourself as an example and hold each other accountable. And takeaway six - do not co-sign loans. Just - it's too risky for both your own finances and the relationship."
