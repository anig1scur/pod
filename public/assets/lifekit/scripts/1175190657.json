There are seemingly endless resources for all the physical and logistical aspects of pregnancy but far fewer for renegotiating your sense of self. Life Kit spoke with author and journalist Chelsea Conaboy about how pregnancy impacts the brain and how to embrace the changes that parenthood brings.",

      "text": "Hey there, Andee Tagle here. I'm a reporter and producer for LIFE KIT, and I'm also on my way to a brand new title - parent. As of the recording of this episode, I am 7 1/2 months pregnant and, friends, this process has been a lot. Don't get me wrong, my partner and I are thrilled. We are over the moon to be starting our own little family. But also, wow, I truly did not know how many emotions I was capable of feeling all at once until I got pregnant. The answer to date, I think, is somewhere around 27. And I know, I know. Emotionality comes with the territory. But the social, emotional and mental weight of this time is so much more than just those little flashes of great big feeling. The internal shifts set off by pregnancy feel structural and endlessly bewildering."

And so there's this conflict between wanting to feel like I am still me - right? - or am I being subsumed by this sense of maternal duty?"

And on top of all of that, there's the guilt and shame for feeling anything other than happy during those 40 long weeks."

We all know that pregnant people go through big hormonal changes."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "That's amazing and a fact that helps paint a more complete picture of the hormonal experience of pregnancy and parenthood. This developmental stage even has its own name - matrescence - and we have a whole episode on it when you're ready for it. It adds more weight and depth to the idea of baby blues, for example, and gives us greater context for so-called pregnancy brain, which is a very real thing."

    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Now, that's a whole lot of change with a whole lot of upside, but that doesn't mean it comes easy. Experts say the hormonal shift from pregnancy is comparable in scope to adolescence. And, I mean, do you remember high school? I've got a stack of angsty mix CDs that reminds me of just how turbulent those teen years were. So the next time you, oh, I don't know, discover you accidentally tossed your brand-new compression socks in the trash, have a mini meltdown mid Krispy Kreme donut or have a great big, fat cry right in the middle of your workday, try to give yourself a break because, as Chelsea now understands intimately, growing pains, mental discomfort are just part of the parenting process. Before giving birth, she had this idea."

The reality is psychological distress is an inherent part of this transition to parenthood. I just - I don't know anyone who has gotten there without experiencing some, whether it's from struggles with fertility complications during pregnancy or childbirth, the postpartum experience itself or the return to work. And so struggle is really inherent. The thing that shouldn't be is suffering."

      "text": "Now, let's get our emotional houses in order - not always an easy task with all the mental and emotional gray area surrounding pregnancy. Takeaway two - grief and goodbyes are part of the process. When I found out I was pregnant, there were so many big, albeit seemingly frivolous, parts of my identity that I had to give up overnight. Before I got pregnant, for example, I was a huge lover of energy drinks. Like, if I were an action figure, a giant Monster can would definitely be one of my accessories. Old me loved to have a spontaneous night on the town with friends, to be the party starter and the last-minute concertgoer. She liked going for really long runs on Saturday mornings and doing most of her writing late, late into the night."

Maybe take a moment to just address your feelings out loud. Like, you know what, man? All this change has been painful. Even though I really, really wanted this, I miss how things used to be, and I'm scared for what's coming. Shy says you might even consider designating a sad hour."

I may, in my brain, have wanted my arm to do this right now, and it's just not. And you know what? That's OK. Because in this moment, my arm is doing what it needs to facilitate where I am and where this baby is right now, and really accepting that, like, now is not the time to push yourself to do more than you need to do."

And remember, your body is already pushing itself in so many other ways, which leads us to an idea that probably feels obvious here, but it's a biggie. Takeaway three - don't discount the impact your changing body has on your mood and emotions."

So, for example, you know, if a woman has nausea and she doesn't have any depression or anxiety before that, the nausea may be what leads her to feeling more depressed or anxious. As we know, many women struggle with body image issues, which may or may not be on the spectrum of eating disorder as well. And I think it's a really difficult time as women navigate these changes."

And you know how hard you have to work to do that? There's a study from 2019 that shows that pregnancy pushes the limits of physical human endurance and that the metabolic toll of pregnancy resembles the efforts of ultramarathon runners or Tour de France cyclists. That is gold-medal effort, friends, so be proud of it."

A lot of my friendships feel at a crossroads, for example. On one side are all my parent friends excited to welcome me to a club that I don't fully have access to yet. On the other side, non-parents who extend their well wishes but, of course, have very different interests and hobbies and priorities than I do. It's a gap that can sometimes feel awkward and hard to bridge on either side."

So I think it's really important when we listen to others. We can really learn a lot from other people, but everything we hear, we should just take with a grain of salt. At the end of the day, when we set boundaries, we teach other people how they can treat us and how we're going to treat them."

      "text": "Tell them that you hope that they trust you enough to take the things that make sense for you in your own parenting practices with your partner. And that might mean taking some things from my own childhood, leaving some things behind and communicating to your parents that that doesn't mean that you don't love them or value them or value their input. It just means that this is your opportunity to figure out what you want your motherhood or your parenthood to look like. And that's OK."

      "author": "PORTER",
      "text": "No one is a mind reader. And so communicating hopes, dreams, expectations is super important, especially during a phase where you often - I mean, the pregnant person oftentimes is like, every day is a new day. I don't even know what I'm going to need tomorrow, but let me check in with you in the morning about how I'm feeling. And then maybe we'll have another check-in in the evening."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "There's no prize for struggling the most during pregnancy and no trophy for doing it all on your own, although I admit I do feel triumphant these days every time I get off the couch without assistance. As we've said before, now is not the time to push it or to suffer in silence. Support in pregnancy could and should look like lots and lots of different things. A partner who can hold your hand at the doctor's office or a friend who offers you hand-me-down maternity clothes, a coworker who can cover an extra shift or two when your symptoms are really bad or a church group that could provide you some free, hot meals. From there, the only way out is through. So take it day by day and try to remember, change can be hard but also good."

So here's to everything you are and everything you're becoming, fellow parent-to-be."

      "text": "OK, preggos (ph), let's recap. Takeaway one - understand that pregnancy remaps the brain to prepare you for parenthood. That's a huge and wonderful change that can also bring a lot of growing pains. Takeaway two - it's OK to grieve the loss of your old selves as you make room for the future. Your feelings are valid and an important part of the pregnancy process. Takeaway three - don't discount the impact your changing body has on your mood and emotions. Yes, pregnancy is extremely physically demanding, but it's also amazing. Try to lean into the wonder. And takeaway four - your relationships will be changed by pregnancy and parenthood. But pregnancy is a team sport, so don't go it alone. And if you don't already have that community built in, know that there are a lot of resources out there, groups like Postpartum International that connect you with care or apps for new parents, like Peanut, that can help answer your questions and connect you to other pregnant people who are going through all these ups and downs too."
