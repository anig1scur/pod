Think about how you want to use them. Do you want to understand your emotions, to figure out what's really bothering you, to prepare for an upcoming test or performance or event? Are dreams a spiritual practice? In a lot of cultures and spiritual traditions, dreams are seen as a sacred space where you can communicate with your ancestors and even divine the future. Maybe they're meaningful for you in that way. Dreams can also be a source of creativity or inspiration for you, as they have been for artists throughout the ages - Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson, Salvador Dali, Paul McCartney. Yeah, a Beatles song came to Paul McCartney in a dream."

    },

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "To me, the back is a vulnerable spot where people can sneak up on you. So I concluded that I've been taking on a more direct leadership role at work. And, sometimes, being in charge scares me. That tracks. But you know, try this at home. See what your dream symbols mean to you. Over time, you might start to notice patterns. Now, up until now, we've been talking about how to remember and interpret the dreams you have. But I've got exciting news. And this is takeaway three. You don't have to wait for dreams to happen to you. You can co-create your dreams with your sleeping mind before your head hits the pillow."

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And we'll get into how to do this. But first, remember your why. Like, do you want to use dreams to help you problem solve? Because dream incubation can help. Maybe you're trying to figure out how to arrange the furniture in your new apartment. Or you need help with a homework problem you've been puzzling over. Deirdre conducted a study on this where she asked 76 students to choose a problem they needed to solve. They tended to pick personal problems, relationship dilemmas or job decisions, things like that. And they did dream incubation for a week. About 50% of them remembered a dream about the problem, and a majority of those students felt it solved the problem. So dream incubation isn't foolproof. It won't work every time, but it could be worth a try. Here's how you do it. Just before you fall asleep, you're going to tell yourself, I want to dream about X."

    {
      "author": "BARRETT",
      "text": "And just have a simple phrase or, at most, a sentence about your question or problem or topic. Tell yourself verbally you want to dream about it and then find an image that really embodies it."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Could be a mental image. Or maybe you look at a physical photo or an object. Deirdre says, by the way, the reason this works is that your dreams are informed by the experiences, emotions, places and people that you've encountered in your waking life. Deirdre used dream incubation once when she couldn't decide how to organize a chapter in her book. Should she write it in more of an essay format or a narrative style? So she thought about that right before she fell asleep."
    },
    {
      "author": "BARRETT",
      "text": "And I actually had a dream that was of flying over a very clear, tropical-looking looking water. And I was looking down and seeing fish and coral reef beneath it about 50%. But the water was also reflecting the clouds in the sky about 50%."

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And what you get out of a dream will often be like this. It'll come in the form of inspiration or a metaphor. And your waking mind will probably have to fill in some gaps. You can use dream incubation for other things too. Like, if you're having a nightmare over and over, you can try to change the dream by coming up with an alternate ending during your waking life."
    },
    {
      "author": "BARRETT",
      "text": "And then every night as you're falling asleep, you'd be saying the simpler version of, if the nightmare starts tonight, I want it to take this other path."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Maybe you often dream about a schoolyard bully. And you decide that tonight, instead of running away from them, you're going to fight them off or shrink them to the size of a bug and then flick them into outer space. Use your imagination. Remember - this is dream world. This can be a really helpful exercise for people with post-traumatic stress disorder who may want to do it with the guidance of a therapist. You can also use dream incubation to craft yourself. A fun little dream. You know, maybe before you go to sleep, you tell yourself, tonight, I want to dream about sitting down to an all-you-can-eat buffet made up entirely of dessert - pastries, ice cream, warm chocolate chip cookies. Or I want to dream that I'm having a love affair with my celebrity crush. Worth a shot, right? Okay, so we're learning that we can take control of our dreams. Our next takeaway is about the ultimate form of that. If you want to take your dreams to the next level, try lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams are a phenomenon where you're asleep, and you become aware that you're dreaming. Alice Robb says there are people who get really skilled at this."
    },
    {
      "author": "ROBB",
      "text": "And not only recognize that they're in a dream but then decide to stay in the dream and can even, you know, take control of what happens in it."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "She says lucid dreams can be another treatment for nightmares - where you fight off a bully, for instance. But you do it aware at the moment that the whole thing is a dream. So you're kind of making decisions on the fly. You can also use lucid dreaming to practice something, a speech, a performance, or to just have fun, you know, outside the realm of physics. Like, in dreams, you may be able to fly or do superhuman things like magic. So if you want to have a lucid dream, a few tips. First, do all the regular stuff. Start remembering your dreams. Keep a dream journal. And take note of the recurring symbols or environments that show up. Like, maybe you always dream about your ex, but that person is not a part of your waking life. Or maybe in your dreams, you're always seeing wild animals that you don't generally encounter during the day - you know, lions, dolphins, giraffes. Alice says once you're aware of these, they can help you recognize when you are in a dream. And that's the goal when you're training yourself to lucid dream. You want to be constantly asking yourself throughout the day, am I awake or asleep?"
    },
    {
      "author": "ROBB",
      "text": "Really taking a moment to consider your surroundings and think, you know, just does it feel like I'm in a dream? Is there any evidence that things are shaky. And actually do something, like, you know, you might pinch your nostrils and see if you can still breathe. And if you can't breathe, then you know you're awake."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "That's what lucid dreaming researchers call a reality test. Another one - you can poke your hand to see if your finger passes through it or jump up in the air. Do you drop back down to the ground, or can you suddenly fly? You might also pick up a book, look at the words, look away and then look right back. If you're in a dream, the words might look different the second time. Alice says if you're a beginner, you want to do these reality tests many times a day. And the thinking is that if you get in the habit of doing these in your waking life, your brain will have you do them in a dream, too, and that'll cue you in. Like, oh, this is a dream."

    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Like, one researcher finds it helpful to repeat a mantra, like, this is a dream. I am dreaming - to stay in it. By the way, we're just scratching the surface on lucid dreaming techniques. There are books that'll walk you through it in much more detail. One author to look for is the researcher I just mentioned, Stephen LaBerge. He was one of the first people to prove in a lab that lucid dreams are a real thing. He did this back in the '70s and '80s at Stanford. In some studies, LaBerge verified that participants were lucid dreaming by their movements or breath. He would tell them what to do ahead of time, like, squeeze your fist or move your eyes in this direction this many times. It's like they were sending a flare signal from the dream world. And it worked. Alice has had a lucid dream. You heard some of it at the beginning of the episode. She was swimming in a pool, but it was this heightened, sensual experience."

I would say the color red, for instance. And then, like, strawberries would show up. Kind of felt like a half lucid dream because what I really wanted were beams of colored light, but I got fruit instead."

Here's another way they're similar."

    },
    {
      "author": "BARRETT",
      "text": "You shouldn't try to idealize dreams and struggle at it too hard because I think that human life just has so many potential wondrous paths toward self-exploration and realization. So give dreams a try. They're so wonderful for so many purposes, for so many people. But if they come with great difficulty to you, launch yourself in some other interesting direction."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK, it's time for a recap. Dreams have a lot of applications. Think about how you want to use them. Do you want to solve a problem? Are you an artist or a writer or a researcher who's looking for creative inspiration? Are you trying to understand your emotions? These things are all possible with dreaming. When you interpret your dreams, think about what a symbol or a metaphor means to you, not about what a dream dictionary says. You also don't have to wait for dreams to happen to you. You can co-create them with dream incubation and even lucid dreaming. But remember, dreams are not the only path towards self-exploration. If they're just not happening for you, give it a rest and try something else."
