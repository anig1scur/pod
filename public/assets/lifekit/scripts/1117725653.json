      "text": "This is NPR's LIFE KIT. I'm TK Dutes. When people would call me resilient, I would say thank you, but it didn't feel like a compliment. I couldn't put my finger on it. It's one of the weirdest compliments one could get. It's the only one where a person makes a pity face when they say it. You're so resilient - and then that face. So in addition to thinking up witty retorts, I wondered what it really means to be resilient. Well, the American Psychological Association defines it as, quote, \"the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or changing life experiences, especially through mental, emotional and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands.\" To put it another way..."

So we learn how to live with them."

I want to be able to feel the full spectrum of my feelings without bottling them up or learning how to function in a dysfunctional world. Come on now. Amen. I want things to feel like less constant assaults on my spirit where I'm just pretending everything's fine. That little dog in the meme - everything's fine."

It's exhausting. It's draining. And even more importantly, we shouldn't have to. So when I hear people say things like, can I just peace off, or I don't want to work so hard, or I don't want to do X, Y and Z, I don't want to be resilient - what I'm hearing or how I interpret that is, I see something wrong with this situation."

Like, people have lost the opportunity to - you know, you're not supposed to show your hand, or you're not supposed to cry at work. And I feel, you know, if I have an emotion - let's say at work - I definitely - first thing I feel after the emotion is embarrassment, right? Like, something is not allowing me to be my whole self. Why is that? Why can't I show the thing? Why do I have to steal myself? How can people, just in general, account for the trauma that builds resilience in others, right? Like - you know, like, I just feel like folks aren't giving each other a chance anymore to be fully human."

So to me, neoliberalism is designed to focus on not just people's worth as workers, but really designed to focus on individuals and separating us and dividing us, and also expects individuals to be able to care for themselves when, historically, we've always cared for ourselves within communities. And so I think what you're referring to about us not giving each other a chance - that's not the fault of the people. It's the fault of the systems. We get it in our messaging. We get it not just in social media. We get it in our movies. We get it in our TV shows."

So for those who feel they need to be in therapy, definitely they can have a conversation with their therapist about wanting to work on things like their self-esteem, increasing their level of social support, increasing their level of self-compassion, helping them work on their problem-solving skills, helping them feel more confident and in control of - not everything in their life 'cause we do live under capitalism and white supremacy - but having some control over some parts of your life, as well as being able to manage your emotions effectively. I'm not saying shut them down, but really learn how to manage your emotions in the face of stress."

And somebody walks directly into me and cuts me off. There are a variety of ways I could respond. I could respond by yelling at the person and cursing at them, or I can respond with a hold on. Take a minute. You don't know what's happening with this person. Yes, I know, you really want the pizza. It's amazing. It's fantastic. But you don't know what's going on with this person. So by stopping and taking a minute and not being solely reactive, I just managed my emotion. But usually when we're trying to be resilient, we stop, assess the situation and try to figure out which emotions are - here we go - socially appropriate for the circumstances 'cause - and let's be really clear. When we're talking about resilience, it's always about what's socially acceptable 'cause resilience in different countries and different communities looks different."

      "text": "So that's one. And I guess the second thing is that if you're finding yourself thinking about, well, you know, I've been resilient or I've been told I've been resilient all this time, I think it's important to think about whether you're telling a truth about what you're experiencing. Sometimes we don't even think, oh, I'm being resilient. We're just doing the thing. We're just engaging in the different things that make us resilient. So, for example, being constantly levelheaded in the face of what we know are coordinated attacks, whether they're political attacks or economic attacks on our communities, that's not always the best approach."

      "text": "Resisting by leaning into your anger or your frustration or your disappointment or your sadness or your overwhelm about these things, and then using those emotions to move you to collaborate with others to fight back and to change things, those are signs of health. Those are signs of growth. So resistance can be sometimes better than resilience because resilience can be just putting up and going back to a former way of being that wasn't always good depending on the situation."

      "text": "Yes, in these trying times. What's been really helpful for me is being a priest. Leaning into and sometimes literally, like, sitting next to my religious and my spiritual practices have gotten me through. They get me through. And so that also includes having elders that I can talk to about what they've seen, what they've experienced, as well as reading the religious texts in my religion. That's been really helpful for me, in addition to having a movement practice, a daily movement practice. You know, it's doing something that gets my blood moving. It's like - whether it's a moving meditation, whether it's walking or exercise in some other way, it's helping me be grounded..."

And it's something that I'm personally working on as well, just finding those spiritual sources, the therapeutic sources, the everyday sources, just - you said movement. And literally last night, I said to myself, man, I got to make sure I don't stare at this computer all day because it'll suck you in, and it won't spit you back out. So it's like it's up to us. So thank you, Lourdes, for helping me recognize that a lot of this is about agency. So thank you so much for your time and energy and knowledge and everything today. I appreciate you so much."

      "text": "Hi, this is Annie (ph) from Philly. My life tip is to keep social media apps deleted throughout the day - so like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter - and then at the end of the day, when you're done with work, maybe you're sitting down on the couch watching some TV, re-download those apps. You can scroll through for a bit. It kind of prevents you from, you know, checking Instagram at a red light or walking down the street and scrolling through Twitter. It just helps to be more present and mindful throughout the day and just to not have that distraction."
