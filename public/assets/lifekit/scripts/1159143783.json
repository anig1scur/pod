It can be anxiety-inducing, especially if you have sensitive teeth or you've had a bad experience before. And it can be expensive. But it is an important part of taking care of your teeth. And the health of your teeth and your mouth can affect your whole body. According to the Mayo Clinic, poor oral health has been associated with cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, and other conditions. This episode of LIFE KIT, which first aired in February, is all about teeth. Reporter Aja Drain talks about how to find the right dentist, how to take care of your teeth at home, and what to do when it seems impossible to get the care you need."

For those who don't already have one, how do you find the right dentist to help you get started on your road to good oral health? Well, for starters, it's all about networking. You can start by asking your childhood dentist or talk with loved ones to see who they liked and why. But make sure you're clarifying if they're talking about their dentist or the hygienist. Both are important in their own ways."

They can be come-ons, and once you're in the chair, those dentists know you're more likely to say yes to extra procedures because you're more nervous. Speaking of nerves, fear is a real barrier to consider. You may be worried about being shamed for waiting so long to see a dentist or intimidated by needles and machines they use to clean your teeth. You could have fear and not even know what you're fearful about. The fear of the unknown is valid. I hear you. But that leads us into takeaway two. Get specific about your fears, and then you can talk about them with your oral health team. The right practitioner can help you through fear and anxiety, and a good practitioner is going to be a great educator and help ease those fears."

All of this information is fine and dandy, but we're not going to pretend a big reason many don't go to see a dentist is because they can't afford to. A lot of private practice dentists are very costly without insurance depending on the state you're in, if you accept Medicaid, and most dental care isn't covered by the basic Medicare plan. And to be transparent, when I was looking for alternatives for this episode, options are slim if you're uninsured. However, Alicia shared with me how practitioners and programs across the country are trying to fill in the gaps causing disparities in oral health care. That leads us to takeaway three. Although there are few, there are options for dental care with limited funds or no insurance."

One way is to use a manual brush, brushing each tooth, slightly sweeping the gumline with your brush at a 45-degree angle. You'll be able to remove plaque particles. When you go to the dentist and get your teeth polished, that removes the biofilm aka the outer layer of your teeth."

Before we get into anything, we need the right tools for our toolkit. Mark and Alicia recommend a soft, high-quality toothbrush you should be replacing every 4 to 6 weeks, some non-nylon floss, a tongue scraper and a low-abrasive toothpaste. And funny enough, toothpaste can be helpful but is playing a smaller role than you'd expect in actually cleaning your teeth."

When we start eating a lot of goldfish crackers, our biofilm - that plaque layer, gets very thick and very furry to the point where it can't do what it's supposed to do. And that is remineralize teeth and protect the teeth. And that's what a toothbrush does. It thins it by - you're not really removing it. You're disorganizing that biofilm layer and allowing it to reform into its more natural, thinner, more slipperier kind of state."

So for anyone that's eating junk or candy or having a soda or even having coffee or a glass of wine, wait for at least 30 minutes. Let the pH in the mouth stabilize. Let the tooth, the outer layer of the tooth stabilize and then brush."

Hard to wait 30 minutes when you have to rush out for work or school. OK, if you made it this far, I know you're itching to know about what makes those pearly whites, well, pearly - teeth whitening. We put a lot of stock into the whiteness of our teeth representing how healthy we are. But whiteness doesn't tell the whole story."

Although you should be aiming to reduce plaque on your teeth, teeth aren't naturally white as snow. There is a very slight yellow-white hue of your teeth due to dentin, an inner layer of the tooth under enamel. So if a dentist is immediately bringing up whitening procedures without any evaluation of cavities, gum disease or other issues, be wary."

They're removing stains but are not actually changing the color of your tooth. The ideal way to whiten is to make sure you're getting the product on your teeth only. So if you're at home, you can use a gel and a tray, which intrinsically whitens your teeth. That's what the professionals do because, according to Mark, whitening product can do some damage to those gums."

      "author": "BURHENNE",
      "text": "They get redder. They lose that nice light pink - we call it coral pink. And they turn into this kind of darker color. And, you know, people subconsciously know when someone's unhealthy just by looking at their smile, if they see receding gums or if they see very red gums or bleeding gums or unevenness of the height of the contour of the gum. So yeah, be careful if you're whitening your gums. It could actually cause a dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, which leads to halitosis, bad breath. But you've got the whitest teeth in the room. Great. But you smell bad."
