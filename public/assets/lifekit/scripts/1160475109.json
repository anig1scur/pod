      "text": "(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT - I'm a people-pleaser and an empath. I'm often told that I'm a good listener, and I do love to listen. I feel energized when a co-worker opens up and shares their frustrations with life both in and out of the office. Being that trusted confidant and providing emotional support is something I believe strengthens connections and improves the quality of work. However, my supervisor has developed a habit of routinely sharing very charged emotional issues in their life - their health struggles, their relationship with their children and partner, etc. On top of this, they tend to be a negative Nancy about the projected success of our shared work projects. This pattern has developed to a point where I often come home exhausted. The issue with this predicament is twofold. A, I interact closely with my supervisor every day, making it difficult to take emotional breaks throughout the week. And B, my supervisor is in a position of power, and I feel unsure about how to articulate my need to set emotional boundaries with them. I don't want to harm our working relationship, but I'm nearing my wits' end. Signed, Emotional Overload."

    {
      "author": "PETERSEN",
      "text": "Hmm. Well, here's what my philosophy is. I think, like, a lot of people - especially, I think, millennials, but also people younger and older - have made work really the center of their lives, and so people really rely on work as a source of primary friendship. And so there's this feeling of, like, I have to make friends at work. Otherwise, I don't have any friends. And I think that you should always be friendly at work..."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "author": "PETERSEN",
      "text": "...But you do not have to be friends with your co-workers. Being a friend with someone involves sharing everything that this person is talking about, right? And, like, I'm not saying that if you do that - if you have developed one of those relationships - that you're somehow unprofessional or doing something wrong, more that - that does - like, that's a decision that each person can make. And it shouldn't be, oh, I'm not making those friendships at work, so something's wrong with me. I think, as long as you're friendly, courteous, you know, kind, not an [expletive] - no, I'm not allowed to say [expletive] - not a butt, then you - then that can make you a really good co-worker. This question-writer seems to think that showing emotional closeness with someone - sharing emotional closeness makes them better co-workers, but I would say that the rest of the question indicates that that's not necessarily the case."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Right. Absolutely. That leads me right to my next point, which is it seems like emotional overload. She's kind of carved out a space for herself as the person you bring your problems to in the office. And generally, she seems to like that role. So if that's the case, can she really discriminate here between - you know, if you're that person for one person, do you have to be that person for everyone?"
    },
    {
      "author": "PETERSEN",

      "text": "Yes. And it's OK to feel frustrated with, like - maybe this person really thought that, like, oh, I thought that we'd get, like, maybe a little bit of good gossip, and then we'd be able to maintain the same sort of level of disclosure. But this co-worker - the supervisor - has allowed this relationship to become something more. And I think, like, she has two options, right? Like, she can either decide, oh, I guess I did this to myself. I just have to deal with it because this is like, you know, I said that this gives me energy. I recruited this behavior. Or she can figure out how to, like, I think, corral the energy that she has invited into one place. So, like, maybe, like, Friday lunch is like, let's put all of our information - like, all of that, you know, struggle into - let's save it for lunch. And then, when this person starts to bring that up, they can be like, this is Friday lunch material. And then if it's exhausting, then it's the end of the week. You know, they don't have to come back to work - that sort of thing."

Say talking about our personal lives during the workday. Do you feel like we could maybe try, like, storing it up and putting it into, like, a big lunch that we have together on Fridays? And I think, by making it about us - right? - about the two of them, instead of I'm really struggling with dealing with your personal information..."

You know, after someone says, like, oh, this isn't going well. This isn't going to work no matter what we try - blah, blah, blah. You can ask and pepper questions throughout the day or your relationship that are saying - what is working really well? What's a win that we've had this week? You know, just in those small ways, trying to insert a different framing into the conversations about work - and this is difficult because I think sometimes it can be, like, fake positivity."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Yeah, I like that - thinking about - I guess the bigger question that I'm thinking about here is, you know, what emotional obligations do we have to our co-workers? You know, like, we want to have our harmonious work environment. We want to get along with everybody. But that line feels really nebulous."

      "author": "PETERSEN",
      "text": "Yeah, it does. And I think that, for me, I have some very good friends and also my partner, who are people that I have met at work. So sometimes, you know, cultivating those stronger emotional relationships can be really positive and is a form of solidarity, especially when you are all on the same level. And I think, oftentimes, when you cultivate that sort of emotional connection, it can also be harder to make the right decision about speaking up about mistreatment, about exploitation, about, you know, even just coming to the point of recognition that this job is no longer a good job for me."

That would - to me, that would cross a line. Like, I would say, yeah, I don't really want to talk about anything right now, right? If someone was my actual friend in the workplace, they would, like - they would know to come up to me.
