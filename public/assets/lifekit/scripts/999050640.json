It's whatever you want it to be. It's your relationships, your education, your knowledge, the things you own, anything you can pass down to make your mark on the world."

It means a lot of things to a lot of people, so I just wanted to make sure I got it right. And lots of them brought up the idea of mindset - that building up long-term wealth really required a mindset change. So Dr. Jolly and I started there."

    {
      "author": "JOLLY",
      "text": "Yeah. So in my research, what I found was there are four key barriers. They were trust, capital, leadership and accountability. The first thing was trust. And trust is such a big thing. What I want people to understand is that you must first trust yourself. And then once you can trust yourself, you can start to prioritize what really matters because what lies under a lack of trust, that I have found, is a lack of priorities. And so you can't trust everybody with everything. But if you have certain priorities - you know, listen; this is where I need help 'cause I really want this - and you can seek out people who can help you with something. But when you have a low level of trust, you hold everything close to your heart. And wealth is a group process."

So now that, you know, we're getting our mind right, we're trusting ourselves, then there's the world that tells me because I'm Black, because I'm a woman, because, you know, I might be LGBTQ, I might be a million things that take me further away from my friend to the left that is white, hetero, cis, male. Can you talk about the variety of wealth gaps? Like (laughter)..."

And so just what you talked about in terms of the grass always looks greener on the other side - listen; I think the comparison piece hurts. Now, there's a reality in America that some people had a leg up against other people."

And I always feel like someone's waiting in the wings to ask me for what I worked so hard to build. And I've already got plans for that because I'm trying to do the same as you and build generational wealth. So who is this stranger, not stranger - you know, it could be a cousin.

There is risk, but there's a reason that there's a difference between an accredited and nonaccredited investor because we've got protections to be able to make sure. And then when we think about your life, think about - you're going to remain healthy - right? - with health insurance. But also think about at the end of your life, you can pass on a lifetime of savings to that next generation because when you transfer what you accumulated, that insurance policy stipulates certain things that your family would have to do to be able to receive the resources.
