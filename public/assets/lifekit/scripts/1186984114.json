Write down every anecdote that you can think of, like when you chipped your tooth in middle school or when your dog Cookie ran away or the first time that you fell in love. What are some themes that come up? Maybe you only focus on one part of your life. Do you want to focus on your relationship with your sister or how cooking changed your life? Also, you don't have to tell every story that's ever happened to you. Use your outline to help pick out the most important parts of your story to showcase. The Dennises employ a collaborative method to their memoir writing. The duo rely much on David Dennis Jr. interviewing his dad to pull from the 83-year-old's memory."

If I said it was a green chair, he'll say, oh, no, actually, I remember it now. It was a red chair. So we would just go back and forth with that until the chapters were pretty much done. So it was a lot of back and forth, and sometimes it would jog his memories. And the memories would come whenever they came, and I had to tell him, hey, the book is done. Don't tell me any more memories that you have, please."

So she picks specific stories from her outline to help show all that. Then, within each anecdote, she shows not only what happened to her, but shows her evolution. In a chapter called My Sister's Keeper, she talks about how she holds herself accountable for the microaggressions that she once projected towards the queer community."

But I feel like the best work is when people get as specific to their experience, specific to the point of being esoteric, about themselves, about their experiences, about their lives. If you're going to write about your experience, you can explain it if you want to, if that's, like, part of your thing. But you don't have to, and you don't have to be self-conscious about it."

Miraculously, Damon's dad got off, courtesy of a Black police officer who acknowledged that they were racially harassed. I mean, after all, they were called the N-word."

And it's ridiculous that I would assign any measure of my Blackness to how I was treated by a white person - like, because I felt like not being called that, for whatever reason, made me, like, less Black in a way. I need to tell this story because this story, I think, informs just my sensibility, the way I kind of assess the world."

If Damon's voice and sense of humor are not appealing, then audiences can jump ship after that first chapter - like, deuces. This is totally fine because, as they say, every author ain't for everybody. Well, that's not exactly the quote, but you get my point."

And it's uncovered and it's out there. People will touch that wound, and it can get infected and it will re-injure you. When you put pieces of your life out there, you have to know, is this covered? Am I healed, because I am giving people the opportunity to touch it, to prod, and not everyone's going to nurture it, right? So you need to protect yourself."
    },
    {
      "author": "LEON",
      "text": "You're going to need to decide for yourself what your scars are and what your wounds are. That's going to look different for everyone. So if that story about being bullied because you were fluffy in high school is still too traumatic to share, maybe consider discussing the rare moments that you had with your late grandmother instead. In \"Ride Or Die,\" Shanita explores some heavy topics, like being sexually harassed at 12 years old, toxic generational patterns and dating an incarcerated partner."

      "text": "All right, homies, it's time to recap. Takeaway one - figure out whether or not you're ready to write your memoir. Takeaway two - draft an outline. If you're not an outline person, then use your book proposal as a guide. Takeaway three - be true to yourself. Be unapologetically true to your experiences, and don't be afraid to reflect that in your memoir. Takeaway four - share your traumas without retraumatizing yourself and create a sustainable self-care practice when doing so. Takeaway five - protect yourself from any legal ramifications - C-Y-A. Takeaway six - get feedback, but make sure it's from those who you trust. And while you're writing, Damon says don't forget to read other people's memoirs."
