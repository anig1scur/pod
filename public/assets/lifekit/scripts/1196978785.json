They need diaper changes. They get overwhelmed easily. To say nothing of getting on a flight - I think just about every parent dreads the thought of a plane ride with a screaming baby. And I am first in that line. So here at LIFE KIT, we wanted to know - how can you enjoy traveling with a young child? We asked one such traveling parent about this reporter and producer, Emily Siner. Hey, Emily."

But I'm doing this because on most airlines, you can travel with a child under two for a very low cost, or even for free if they sit in your lap. We'll talk later in this episode about whether that's actually a good idea, but the fact is, knowing that it could be free made me decide I wanted to do it. And maybe for you, too. Taking a vacation with a small child seems doable in theory. So how do you even start?"

And then now, taking my kid to the grocery store or to the library does not feel like that big of a deal. And that's true with travel as well. The more we do something, the easier it gets. So I would say start on those small adventures. Start by meeting up with a friend at a museum or at the zoo and build up from there. Find what feels comfortable and keep practicing. Keep doing it more, and it will become easier."

      "text": "This is takeaway one - start small and practice. This really resonated with me. Before we took our 13-hour flight to Japan, we flew one hour to Chicago. We also had taken a few road trips to see family, and our very first travel experience was driving an hour and a half to stay in a cabin overnight. I learned all sorts of useful things on these trips, like not to forget the sound machine charger, or that it is possible to change a diaper in a restroom even when there's no changing table. And that practice helped me feel less daunted. It also helps you learn your child's temperament. Christine Sarkis is the editor-in-chief of a travel website called familyvacationist.com and a mom of two. She calls this troubleshooting."

Do I want to buy a lightweight travel stroller, or do I prefer bringing the one I use at home? - which brings us to takeaway two. Make plans that your future self will thank you for. In other words, you don't have to take your 8-month-old to Japan just because you can. We know you can. You're raising a small human. You're awesome. But you might enjoy the trip more if you know you don't have to deal with a 13-hour flight or major jet lag. Here's Preethi."

My husband and I traveled with some friends for part of our vacation, and it was so helpful to have extra hands to hold the baby - shout-out to Gabriel (ph) and Fernanda (ph). It's also good to think about what destination would feel easiest for you. Again, the goal is not to impress other people. It's about thanking yourself later.

I, like, made a little nest for myself, and just read a book for two hours, three hours until it was time to go to bed, whereas, you know, in a vacation rental, I could have sat on a couch."

So what did you find most helpful to think about as you were picking out baby gear for travel?"

I think that on the one hand, you want to make sure that you don't want to go so bare-bones that you don't have the things you need to have a comfortable time but, at the same time, making your sort of your list of things you're going to pack and then going through and being like, do we need this?

It tucks into its own little pouch. It dries really fast, so it's great if you're in a wet or humid climate. So that is definitely one that we grab a lot as well that we take with us."

But either way, you're going to want to check your car seat to make sure it has the FAA-approved language on it. This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft. When you get to the airport, you can take advantage of skycap, that thing where you check your bags at the curbside. Many airlines will let you check a stroller and car seat for free either before you go through security or at the gate. If you do this, you're going to want to get some kind of carrying case to protect them. Or some parents find it easier to bring their kid through the airport in a stroller. Others prefer wearing the baby in a carrier, especially if they're traveling solo. Christine bought a car seat cart."

And this, dear listeners - this is where the rubber really hits the road. The thing that I got the most questions about when I got back from my first trip with the baby was, how did he do on the flight because it seems like the idea of being stuck with and responsible for a screaming baby is one of the biggest fears. So what do people need to know to mitigate that fear?"

They were willing to cut the baby slack. They knew that we were both doing our best, you know?

Maybe the air pressure is getting intense and he needs to suck on something - a pacifier or a bottle. Maybe they need to run down the aisle for a minute, or maybe they're just tired and are overstimulated by all the sights and sounds. I figured out that my baby would only sleep in my lap under a nursing shawl. Christine would put a linen blanket over her baby's car seat to block out the light, and she also had this fun hack to get them used to the sounds of an airplane."

So it was just, like, the hum of the airplane with the occasional, like, ding of someone calling for the flight attendant. So I started playing that for my kids about two months in advance of a trip - I think may have been a moment of genius that actually really worked."

He would wake up at 3 and be ready to play. So I started to nurse him back to sleep, and then he got used to it and kept waking up at 3 for the rest of the trip. That was not the fun part of the trip. Preethi says to help with jet lag at the beginning, you can follow a few basic guidelines - try to stay up until the normal bedtime or keep any naps short. Get as much fresh air and sunshine as possible."

Or if food is a big thing, you know, figuring out - maybe making - if dinner is too tricky with babies, making lunch a really special meal instead."

If you're going on the trip with another adult, talk to them about what you're each hoping to do for yourself and how the other person can help make that happen. Maybe one of you goes on a walk with the baby while the other goes to an art museum, like I did one afternoon in Japan. One night we even hired a babysitter to come to our vacation rental while we went out and sang karaoke. These moments for me made the trip feel more balanced and relaxed.

I think when you're traveling with a baby, you have to be a little bit more active about making those magic moments happen for yourself. Because they require someone else taking care of the baby or the baby being in exactly the right - you know, like, exactly the right amount of fed and rested to allow you to do whatever the thing is that you're hoping to do."

I called them my moments of despair - like when my baby woke up crying at 1 a.m. and then 3 a.m., and then somehow again at 3:30. Or once when we were rushing to dinner so we could get back before the baby got overtired. And I just - I had this moment of missing being able to travel by myself and being able to travel - stay out as late as I wanted and not have to think about finding a restaurant that could take us right away and that kind of thing. Do you ever feel that?"

But maybe if you have a great balcony and a great book that's going to allow you to, like, recharge for the next thing you do, which is maybe not something you did before. Or it's going to give you a chance to journal, and then that's a journal that you then pass on to your kid when they're older. And you know, this is a trip that they're not going to remember because they're so young, but they're going to get to read about it. And how sweet is that?"

He was in his carrier, and he'd just like looked up and just, like, couldn't stop looking up. His, like, eyesight has adjusted. His brain has developed enough that he's, like, seeing this tree for the first time."

But for my and your next trip, let's recap. Here's how to have fun while traveling with young kids. Takeaway one - start small, and practice. Takeaway two - make plans that your future self will thank you for. Takeaway three - travel as lightly as you can. Takeaway four - your baby's still a baby, and that's OK. Takeaway five - it's not all about the kid. And takeaway six - set your expectations. It will be hard, but it will be worth it. Now go out there and plan some magic."
