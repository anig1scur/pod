And it's very rare these days that people are listened to for an extended period of time. But at The Moth, there's no interrupting, and the storyteller really takes you on a journey so that you're next to the storyteller, like, walking in their shoes for five or 10 minutes."

And they have to involve some stakes - you had everything to gain or everything to lose - and some sort of change or transformation over the course of the story. And all Moth stories, depending on where they're told, have a time limit. But I think the biggest thing about Moth-style storytelling is it is personal. You know, it is moments from your life and - that only you can tell."

An anecdote is a funny - this thing happened. It's a moment. A story has an arc. A story has stakes. A story has a beginning, middle and an end. And both anecdotes and stories are incredible. You just need to know where you want to tell which and what the difference is."

And with good stories, Moth-style stories, we tend to encourage people to go inside that. Go inside that anecdote. Go inside that story, and really tell us about it in detail - right? - how it unfolded, how it felt physically and emotionally, like, and really how you were impacted and changed so that you can build out an arc and make that anecdote kind of blossom into more of a full-bodied story."

Usually when I sit down with somebody and they have no idea what story they want to tell, I always say to think back to moments in your life that really shifted you in some way. They can be big moments. They can be smaller moments. You know, we talk about, like, sitting down with an old scrapbook - right? - in your mind of your memories. You know, things - a family vacation or a, you know, some sort of - your first kiss or, like, certain moments that just - memories that stick with you, and dig in to that. Like, why did they stick with you? Why was that important to you? And suddenly, you start to see patterns of your story arise. You know, our founder often says that stories - all stories hinge on a decision. You know, you decided to do something or not to do something."

It - but the whole thing revolves around that moment.

I find that many times, the words that people say to us are so striking we remember them decades later because it was the first time they ever said that. It was the last time they ever said that. You know, you were surprised that they said something like that. And that may be the seed for a longer story. Some other prompts - tell us about a breakthrough moment. Tell us about a time you had to follow your heart. And one of my favorites - tell us about a time you were reunited with something you treasure. So a lot of these prompts in the Moth book, \"How To Tell A Story,\" will lead you to one of your hundred, 200, 300 stories that you could tell."

      "author": "BOWLES",
      "text": "Sure. I mean - it's Meg. Once you find a moment, I always tell people, the first step is to kind of blow it up big and just look at everything you have to play with. Kind of look at where you were in your life at that moment. How did that moment change your situation? You know, how did - what were the results of this event happening to you? Then I ask people to kind of think about, ultimately, what is the story about for you? - you know, just gelling it down to one sentence that can really tell you what the focus of the story you want to tell is. And it just helps you decide, after you blow it up big, like, which of these details are important and support that."

And so the very end of the story needs to - you need to come in for a landing. You need to land the plane. And you need to wrap up the loose ends. You need..."

You just have to end the story in a different place than where you began. So there's the you that we meet in the beginning, and then there's the you that we're left with. And at the end, we can see starkly what your change was, even if the change was slight. We do say in The Moth book, \"How To Tell A Story: The Essential Guide To Memorable Storytelling From The Moth\" - I love the title (laughter) - that you don't need a phrase like, and then I realized, or, and then in that moment, I finally realized."

But you can lift that phrase out, and your story will still make sense. And the last line or the last three lines, let's say, should generally be memorized so that you're really sticking the landing like a gymnast and not circling the drain, as we say, and not trying on different endings for size and trying to figure out how you want to leave your audience because remember; that's the last thing they'll hear from you while you're on stage."

And you're standing there remembering the words that you crafted, but you're not remembering the memories. And not only will it change the way people hear your story because when you're remembering the memories, you just tell it in a different way. You tell it in a more intimate way..."

And so we always tell them not to get too married to your words because you will say it differently every single time. And that's great because the stories are alive, and they're meant to sound alive.

If you get to a point in your story and you realize, uh-oh (ph), I didn't set it up right - I didn't set it up in the way that the audience needed to know this one part - you could always say, what I forgot to tell you or what you need to know before I tell you about my mom is - you know, because the stories are alive.

Sarah, I know you especially work with women. And women's voices are underrepresented across the world, but hugely underrepresented in some of the places in the world where you've worked.

They may tell them to policymakers. They may tell them to parliament. And in other cases, they have laws passed and budgets changed. And we're really leaning in to the ways in which storytelling - personal storytelling - can have more impact and can create deliberate change around the world. Because you can hear about climate change. You can hear about even the pandemic. I mean, some of these world issues are so obtuse and they're so big. It's hard to wrap your mind around. But when you hear a personal story of someone who's lived it and has been forever changed by it, your hearts and your mind is changed.

You know, for a toast, we're sharing some important piece of the person or the thing that we're toasting. You know, with a eulogy, we're remembering and cherishing the person that we're all gathered to remember.

And you're - the person you're toasting or the thing you're toasting, if it's a new hospital or if it's a toast at a wedding, it's something that the audience may not know about the person you're toasting. But it really - the toast should paint them in a beautiful light."

And, you know, you want to find the moments that illuminated something new or surprised you, but no one wants to hear a list of grievances. And so you want to make sure that your stories in these real-life situations are short - short enough so that it allows the person you're with to then tell a story of their own - but that, you know, you're really leading them somewhere so that it isn't just this thing happened."

And often, you distill the story first. You either set it up or wrap it up with a one-sentence version of a story. So I have to ask y'all, tell me how to tell a story in one sentence."

      "text": "Hello. My name is Todd Grabowski (ph), and I have a life hack for fixing any wobbly round table. So if you've ever sat down at a round table and you've noticed that it has a wobble, instead of trying to shim quarters or cardboard or napkins or something under the leg of the table, I have a better way. What you can do is you can slowly start rotating the table, and then testing it as you rotate. And eventually, for any table, as you rotate it, it will find an equilibrium point and will become steady. So give that a shot. And it's that simple."
