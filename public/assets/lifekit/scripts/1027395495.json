      "text": "Lots of people gained excess weight during the pandemic. And emerging data suggests children were no exception. Across racial and socioeconomic lines, kids put on weight as schools went online, sports were canceled, and routines collapsed. Now as children head back to school, some parents are wondering how to get their kids back to healthy habits. On this episode of LIFE KIT, I'm joined by NPR health correspondent and LIFE KIT reporter, Maria Godoy."

      "text": "Well, researchers had expected this to some extent based on what past data shows happens during summers. Kids get out of their normal routines. They tend to gain weight. They're spending more time on screens, less time doing physical activities. And they often stay up later, which can raise their risk of obesity."

    {
      "author": "SANDRA HASSINK",
      "text": "Layered on that were just social isolation and stress, economic downturns that many families experienced and the rise in food insecurity. Then this was kind of like the perfect storm to have issues with weight gain."

    },
    {
      "author": "GODOY",
      "text": "We don't have a complete national picture yet. But early data suggests the weight gain has been across the spectrum - so from little kids to adolescents. It crosses racial and socioeconomic lines. Although it is more pronounced in some communities than others."

      "author": "GODOY",
      "text": "Just to be clear, kids are growing. So they're supposed to be gaining weight every year. That's normal. And healthy kids come in all shapes and sizes. But where it might become a concern is when they're jumping significantly from their usual growth trajectories. So a kid who has been growing consistently along, say, the 25th percentile and then suddenly jumps to the 90th, that might be a signal for a pediatrician to stop and take a look at what's going on."

    {
      "author": "GODOY",
      "text": "Well, they want to see that this is just part of a kid's normal growth pattern. And if it's not, the pediatrician might want to suggest ways to slow the weight gain so that a kid's height can catch up. They might also want to make sure that a child isn't having problems, like elevated cholesterol or fatty liver disease, sleep apnea. And mental health is also a big issue. You know, this pandemic has been stressful for everyone, including kids. It threw their lives into disarray, too. And changed eating habits is one way that manifests itself."

      "author": "GODOY",
      "text": "Well, Rosenfeld is also a psychologist. She specializes in eating disorders. She says, it's key not to focus on the child's weight because you don't want to mess up their body image. Instead, focus on healthy behaviors, including more structured mealtimes and less all-day snacking. That's actually something a lot of parents I talked to say got out of control in the early months of lockdown."

      "author": "ROSENFELD",

And, Rosenfeld says, please don't put your kids on a diet. Restrictive eating can really backfire and set the stage for eating disorders."

And the kid's job is to decide whether and how much to eat."

      "text": "You know, pediatrician Sandra Hassink had some good tips along these lines. Again, you want to make changes as a whole family. So maybe think about doing family walks. For younger kids, maybe create a star chart. And tell them once they fill it out for the week, they get to choose a family activity you all do together. For older kids, you can maybe ask them to do errands with you that just gets them moving. And you can also encourage smaller movement breaks throughout the day."

Maybe take half an hour screen time break in the evening, and maybe extend that to an hour. So the message here is to look at the routines, start small and begin to move your way forward into a healthier routine from the one you have."

We don't know what recess or PE is going to look like. A lot will vary by district. And there's some concern that kids who have gained a lot of weight may face teasing when they go back."

    {
      "author": "GODOY",
      "text": "Think about creating structured mealtimes and snack times for your kids, where you offer a variety of healthy foods so they know when they're eating next and aren't grazing all day. You want to encourage kids to become more mindful eaters. And also, create opportunities for them to move their bodies throughout the day. Family walks are great. And last but certainly not least, be compassionate with yourself and with others."
