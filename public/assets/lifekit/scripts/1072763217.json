It was the first time that I was living away from home, and I was having a really hard time adjusting. My university offered free therapy sessions to students. And I thought, why not? I think I mentioned it to my mom during one of our calls. I didn't really think that much about it."

And these services being offered to me for free kind of gave me the green light to try it out. I think my mom was just happy that I was finally taking ownership over my mental health. How about you, Isa? When was the first time you talked to your parents about this stuff?"

      "text": "I was actually forced to go to therapy in high school, and that didn't work out. But the first time I decided to go was when I was in graduate school. And I was going through culture shock, and so I knew I needed support from a therapist to survive the two years that I was going to be there. And, you know, I just straight of said to my mom, I'm going to therapy. And she was also supportive. My dad was, too. He said, (speaking Spanish) because I moved to a city where I had no family close by, and he was worried about me feeling isolated."

And so as a younger brother, I was just like, oh, this is - you know, this is who he is. This is what it's about. And my brother also was very much from the standpoint of, you know, mental health is not a real thing. You shouldn't go to therapy. You know, when you're feeling sad, stop."

Your mental health journey is your own, and whether or not you want to invite your loved ones into it is your choice. But if you do want to start the conversation, this step is essential."
