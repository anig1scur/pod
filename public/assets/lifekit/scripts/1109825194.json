  "intro": "Have you ever felt resentful or responded passive-aggressively to a request on your time or energy? That's a sign your boundaries are being crossed \u2013 and it might be because you haven't set them clearly. Therapist and author Nedra Glover Tawwab shares advice on how to set boundaries \u2014 and stick to them \u2014 in your daily life.",

Do you ever feel put out by too many social events, fed up by all the requests at work you feel like you have to say yes to, bothered by small asks that make you feel big mad? If you answered yes to any of these, you are not alone. It just means we need to work on our boundaries. Yep, I said our boundaries - because we're in this together."

    {
      "author": "GLOVER TAWWAB",
      "text": "One really good way to discern what your boundaries are is to think about how you feel when you say yes or when you say no. Think about your feelings as they come up - when you feel uncomfortable, frustrated, when you see the resentment creeping in. Those are indicators that perhaps there is space for boundaries in the situation. How many times have we agreed to do things, and then we're upset at the person for asking us instead of placing the boundary of saying, no, I'm already doing too much? Or how often have we agreed to help a friend with a task? Like, yes, I will help you with your hair. I could dye it. And it's like, why did I do this? I don't even know what I'm doing."

      "author": "GLOVER TAWWAB",

Like, how do I honor myself in a way that I would feel good about in the future? Because sometimes we don't know, in the moment, that we've overcommitted, but we can look at a situation after - like, wow, that was really exhausting. So how do we make an agreement with ourselves to not exhaust ourself in the same way in the future?"

      "author": "GLOVER TAWWAB",
      "text": "Yeah, as adults - and, I mean, as kids - there is a lot of pressure to like things that we don't like. And when we really give ourselves the freedom to not like a certain person or to not like a certain thing, we can place some boundaries around that. There are certain people - you know that co-worker - it's like, you don't want to go to their birthday party, but you say yes 'cause it's the thing to do. But really, you can say no. There are other people who probably say, hey, I won't be able to make it, and you can join that bunch of folks."

Like, I'm just not interested in skating. And it's not always saying no to everything, but really figuring out what feels good to you. And sometimes it's moment-to-moment. Today, I would go skating. At that moment, it was a no. I didn't feel like it. It wasn't something that I wanted to do."

A lot of times, I feel like a lot of folks' boundaries are pushed when we push past that - when we, like, make exceptions. And I think there's room for exceptions, but it feels very painful to me, you know, like, what you're describing - you know, I don't want to go skating. But come on, let's go skating, you know?"

You can go on this - like, all of these things that we're getting from family, from friends, from, you know, sometimes our bosses, who are saying, like, oh, you do things so well. This just - it's just another small project. And it's, like, this is, like, going to push me over the edge.

      "author": "DUTES",
      "text": "Yeah. OK. So in a lot of this, I mean, it's how we relate to each other and social expectations and culture. Do people in different cultures experience boundaries in different ways? Right? Like, so, like, I'm a first-generation Caribbean American. So my mother and my father are from the Caribbean straight up. I see they have a different sensibility of things. Do people - and not just like, you know, culture in terms of country, but I do find that women are expected to move their boundaries a lot, you know? So girl culture or women culture - do people in different cultures experience boundaries in different ways?"

      "author": "GLOVER TAWWAB",
      "text": "Absolutely. There is certainly more space for some people to have the freedom of placing boundaries. I think the children who are being raised at this moment, they have a lot of freedom with boundaries that - I mean, the things that my kids say, I'm like, wow, I would've never said that when I was a kid. You know, their culture is different than even my culture. And I think racially, yes. What you feel may be different from what your parents, your other family members, or sometimes your siblings, right? Because just because we're in a family system doesn't mean that we all have the same way of thinking about things. And that can be really difficult because the pushback is serious. It can be, you know, within families - especially dysfunctional families - I mean, it could be you receiving the silent treatment, or you being..."

That is a way to preserve the relationship. You're not saying, hey, I don't want to listen to you say anything. It's really I can't give you the time and energy that this conversation deserves.

It might not work, but right now they're confirming that they see a difference in me. So let's say I haven't gotten to that point. I'm working on it, and there's some - I have some other habits or things showing up - feelings that are coming out. I'm thinking about passive-aggressiveness. I'm thinking about some other side effects of not having strong boundaries.

I'll tell you, when I first wrote my book, I did not imagine how I would be impacted by having, you know, five to six interviews a day. And I started having headaches because I didn't talk that much during the course of a day. I'm a therapist. I listen. My job is mmm hmm, mmm hmm, you know? So just talking for that length of time, I was like, oh, my gosh, I have a headache. And that was my physical reaction to not placing the boundary of - I can only maybe talk to about four people a day. I can only do four interviews. I can't do six.

It's not always saying, OK, I'm out of this relationship, but we choose frequency. We choose duration. We choose a lot. And those are the things that you can adjust when you're in a relationship that you want to keep when someone doesn't want to respect your boundary. Like, OK, then I need to change my frequency. I need to change, you know, perhaps the way I respond to it. Perhaps there is something I can do on my end, but we certainly can't force our boundaries on people."
