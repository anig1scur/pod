      "text": "Hey, everybody, it's Marielle Segarra. I'm looking out my window right now, and there's this gray haze in the sky. It's not like a regular, cloudy day. It looks like the sky in some of the photos I've seen from Mars. And if you actually go outside, it smells like a barbecue. It's wildfire smoke. Hundreds of fires are burning right now in Canada, and the wind has blown the smoke over Ontario, Quebec, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and beyond. And as someone who's lived on the East Coast for most of my life, this is just not something I'm used to. And it's overwhelming and depressing, to be honest. But on today's episode of LIFE KIT, I'll be talking to somebody who does have experience with this. Liz Baker is a producer for NPR's National Desk, and she's based in Los Angeles, which often gets smoked out in late summer. She's covered many wildfires and has suffered through smoky air from Oregon to Minnesota to Australia to Rome. And she's here to help."

      "text": "Well, wildfire smoke has all kinds of bad stuff in it. But what makes it extra, extra horrible are these PM2.5 particles. And these are caused by the super, super hot temps that these fires are burning. They're just burning through forests. They're burning through sometimes houses, plants, animals, everything. They're just burning that up and spitting that stuff up into the atmosphere. And it travels really, really far because it's really, really lightweight. PM2.5 particles are super tiny. They're 1/20 the diameter of a human hair, which means that they can go..."

And because they're so tiny, they go deep into your lungs and into your bloodstream, where they can cause inflammation, damage internal organs, induce heart attacks, strokes and asthma attacks and other breathing issues. It's just some nasty, nasty stuff. And the Scripps Institution of Oceanography did a study in 2021 that found wildfire smoke is 10 times more harmful to humans than other types of pollution, like car exhaust."

    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Well, if you go outside and take a look, if you can see the haze, you probably should try to avoid breathing it. And that's because the EPA found that it's those PM2.5s - those dangerous particles - that cause that haze in the first place. But if you want more specifics, like maybe if you're in a medically sensitive group and you want to know, you can check the AQI. That's the Air Quality Index, and you can find that at airnow.gov. What is it where you are right now, Marielle?"

      "text": "Yeah, it's purple."
    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah, so those health risks are increased for everyone, whether you have asthma, for example, or not. So you might notice when you go outside - you might notice that your throat is a little bit sore. Maybe your nose is running a little bit, or your eyes are running a little bit, and that's probably because of that smoke."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah. OK. So looking at the Air Quality Index, there's a meter that goes from green - which is, you know, fine, normal, go outside, do whatever - all the way to maroon, which is hazardous. Stay indoors. And right now, we're - in New York, we're in the scary part of the meter, but the needle can also fall more in the middle, maybe, like, an orange. And it'll say, you know, you really only have to worry about this if you're in a sensitive group. So what does that mean to be in a sensitive group?"
    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Well, it means you've probably been diagnosed with some kind of preexisting condition, like asthma, COPD. Maybe you've had a heart attack in the past, or you have some cardiovascular issues. Maybe you've had a stroke in the past or your loved one has. So those are things to look out for. That just means that you're going to be a little bit at more risk. You might notice that these conditions aggravate your symptoms. You might need to call your doctor. You might need to get some supplemental oxygen. You'll know if you have these preexisting conditions, usually, and you'll typically have a action plan that you've made with your physician for how to get help and how to recognize when you need help."

    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "So obviously, especially when conditions are this bad, if you're in the purple zone, you should try to stay inside. But what if you have to be outside for some reason? Is there a way to minimize your risk?"
    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah, get a nice N95 mask. That's going to block more of those PM2.5s. Other masks are not going to be up to the job. So you really need a well-fitting N95 mask, which, luckily, we all kind of know. We all know how to put them on. We know when they fit right. Most people will have them at home. So that's actually a weird silver lining of this smoke event, which is that a lot of people will have the tools already to minimize their health effects."

    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Well, one of the things you can do is try to keep the air from outside from getting in in the first place, right? So maybe you have kind of leaky windows and doors. First of all, make sure those are closed, obviously, and then see if you can seal up the cracks at all. Maybe put some towels around your window to keep the air from coming in. Maybe use some tape, whatever you've got to seal that up as best you can. It's going to make a difference because the next step that you want to do is take the air that's already inside your home and get that cleaner. So one way you can do that if you have central AC is you can run your AC, that's going to pass it through some filters and make it cleaner."

      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "If you have a window unit, maybe you don't actually want to run your air conditioner, maybe you want to use a fan, 'cause the thing we're trying to avoid is pulling that gross air from the outside into your home. We want to clean the air that's already in your home. And if you have an air purifier, definitely run that. This is what they're made for."

    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah. So if you're in your car, hit that recirculate button. Maybe you've never used it. It's that outline of a car with those arrows in it. And instead of pulling new air from the outside and putting it through your AC, for example, it just takes the air that's already in your car cabin and puts it through. So as you run that car, that air is just going to get cleaner and cleaner and cleaner until you can't tell that it's even smoky."

      "text": "Yeah, when I go on wildfire assignments, I always bring a Neti Pot. I find that that really helps at the end of the day to just clear some of that goop that's stuck in my sinuses out. Makes a huge difference if you've been suffering from a sore throat. Saline rinse for your eyes or eyedrops - really helpful. And then for your skin, get a really hydrating moisturizer. You're looking to keep the moisture that's already in your body in there because that smoke is just going to pull it out of you, right? These wildfires happen in places that are dry. The smoke is blown by the wind. And these are two things that are really bad for your skin. They really dry you out quickly. So putting that layer on, it's going to keep the moisture in, and it might help to keep some of that goop from settling into your pores, too."

    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah, this one's my specialty 'cause I hate that smell so much. I bring a little vial of mint essential oil or a strong ChapStick like a Burt's Bees or something that's going to be really overwhelming to your senses. Put that on. That's really going to help. It just - the air you're breathing is going to smell better, and it might make you feel better, too, because when you're breathing that smoke, maybe it's creating some anxiety. It smells bad, the sky looks really freaky. Anything that's going to help calm you down and make you feel a little bit better is going to help you overall, too, because stress is just going to make all the health effects of this smoke worse. So the best thing you can do is stay calm and find stuff that works for you that overcomes some of the things that you find gross or upsetting about the smoke."

      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah, especially for you East Coasters who haven't had to deal with this. I mean, here on the West Coast, we've been - almost every summer, we're seeing really huge fires and towns getting burned to the ground. And it's really a lot. It's really upsetting. So hang in there. I wish I could tell you it's going to get better, but I don't think we know how long the smoke is going to be socked in there on the East Coast for you guys."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. So I have to tell you, in the time that we've been talking, I just checked the EPA app again, and the air quality has now gone up to 324 - the AQI. So now we're in maroon territory, which they just flat-out say is hazardous, and the steps to take are everyone should stay indoors and reduce activity levels."
    },
    {
      "author": "BAKER",
      "text": "Yeah, that maroon color means everyone is likely to experience some form of smoke-related health issue. Maybe that's minor, like sore throat or eyes, or maybe it's more long term, maybe it's more serious. It's really hard to say, because we don't really know 100% what the long-term effects of breathing this stuff is. But just to make you guys feel better - right? - there are communities on the West Coast that have been dealing with smoke events for a long time, and it's not like everybody is suffering from severe asthma now. So don't freak out too much but stay inside. Yeah, stay inside. That is pretty bad. Over 300 is bad news."
