      "text": "I recently started a podcast called \"This Is Good For You\" because I realized I did not have anything I did strictly for pleasure and I could not relax. I had monetized almost everything I enjoyed. Everything I love to do has turned into work. My love of film, television and literature has led to a career of pop culture criticism, which I wouldn't change for the world, but I miss doing something just for the joy of it. So to get back into the habit of doing something strictly for myself, I tried to revive an old hobby - amateur photography. Then the pandemic hit. I was stuck at home, and there are only so many pictures of my cat that I can take."

I could order supplies easily enough, and the repetitive motion of moving the needle through fabric helped soothe the anxiety I was feeling. Some people think of a hobby as something you do when you're bored, but it's so much more than that. Sometimes a hobby begins as a solitary adventure into stress relief."

Before I let our hobbyists tell you how to get started, let's look into why having a hobby is so important for our mental health. And it's our first takeaway. Hobbies are good for you."

    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "According to Professor Yoshi Iwasaki, chair of public health and recreation at San Jose State University, when we bring meaning to our leisure time, like through hobbies, it helps improve our mental health. He has a doctorate in recreation and leisure studies, so he knows all about the importance of what we do away from work. In his 2014 article, \"Role Of Leisure In Recovery From Mental Illness,\" he explained that other benefits include strengthening our sense of connection, identity and our autonomy."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "And that's certainly true of all three of our hobbyists today. They found connection and community, use their respective hobbies to stand proud in their identities and found unexpected freedom. Marc Castaneda hasn't been knitting for that long, but he knew he needed something to counter anxiety, especially after moving to New York from Texas a couple of years ago."

      "text": "Marc and Kareemah began knitting and climbing respectively in order to help manage anxiety and depression, but Thuy realized she had a knack for mixing drinks after a successful dinner party. Creating signature cocktails for her reading list, Thuy we became a part of the bookstagram community, the group of people who share reading habits and reviews via Instagram. Not only was she able to find other readers and critical thinkers, but she was also able to strengthen the bond to her Vietnamese heritage."

Like, so it's been, like, a really amazing experience to find this community and also, I think, getting connected more into the larger diasporic Vietnamese community as well. And I think through Mixaphoria, like, I've been connected to some organizations like the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, and I've been doing some events with them."

      "text": "You know, no one's doing it for you. You know, no one's giving you an extra help. In a way, it's all you - and I think, especially as a person with a disability. When I became a person with a disability 10 years ago, that feeling I was struggling with, which I find a lot of people with disabilities tend to struggle with, is about when you have a lot of able-bodied people around you, you know, are you doing it yourself? You know, who's helping you? That sense of independence is super important to us and being self-sufficient. And I feel like climbing does that but at the same time allows to bring people together."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "All right. I think Marc, Kareemah and Thuy would agree that their hobbies are good for them. Marc and Kareemah improved their mental health and found a new sense of community. Kareemah was reminded of her own independence even in the midst of others. And Thuy found a new community and reconnected with her heritage. So how can you gain similar benefits? What are the first steps in starting a hobby? This is our second takeaway. You have to figure out what you want to do. Kareemah suggests making a list."

You can do your research by going into a yarn shop and just chatting with the yarn shop owner and asking for their help."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "Your research can be solitary by going online and checking out tutorials. But you should also be open to reaching out to other people who have more experience than you do, which can mean going into a store, maybe even taking a class or scrolling through hashtags on Instagram, which can lead to the more popular resources. If looking online becomes overwhelming, try a search for best knitting tutorials or best local climbing gym, for example."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "You also need to find out, how much will this hobby cost? Is it accessible for you? Kareemah admits that climbing is expensive, with key items like rope often ringing up at over a hundred dollars. But there are still ways to get into it. The Adaptive Climbing Group that Kareemah founded - and now serves as its program director - sponsors paraclimbers for national and international competitions."

    },
    {
      "author": "CASTANEDA",
      "text": "Just remember that you're not going to be instantly good at something. I had to learn the hard way about that, right? Like, I'm a perfectionist, but I had to remember, like, I am a beginner. I'm picking this up for the first time, trying to be perfect. And that is - those expectations that I was giving myself were too high. I think, just do your best. You know, if you mess up, that's OK. That's part of the process."

      "author": "PHAN",
      "text": "If I need to take a break, that's fine. Because when I come back, like, people will still enjoy what I put out there. And if they don't, then OK. That's good feedback, too, you know? Like, so I try to not try to feel too antsy or put too much pressure on myself. Because this is for me, and it should be a source of joy and not so much a source of pressure or anxiety. So I try to approach it with that mindset."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",

      "text": "Because I just - I - there's something so beautiful and unique about creating something for yourself or for others. And I know that sounds very cheesy. But after I finished my first project, I was so proud of myself. And I wasn't trying to get people to tell me, like, how awesome it was. I wasn't looking for compliments. I was just so excited to say I made this myself with my two hands. I was able to put the time in, the commitment and, like, really hunker down and, like, create something that I really wanted."

The biggest takeaway should be that, No. 1, hobbies are good for you - for your mental health, your sense of community and independence and your identity. No. 2 - figure out your interests. What do you gravitate toward? Is there something you've always wanted to try? How would this fit into your daily life? Write a list of three things that appeal to you, including two that you would never think to try."
    },
    {
      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "Takeaway No. 3 - research. Once you've found the hobby on your list that you can't stop thinking about, start gathering information. This is when the internet can actually be your friend. How accessible is this hobby? How much does it cost? What exactly do you do? Look up tutorials on YouTube, find out if there are any local stores that sell the supplies you need and if you're able, go in for a visit. Marc went into a yarn store, and once people realized he was a novice, they told him about meetups he could attend. Perhaps you'll be just as lucky."

      "author": "PERKINS",
      "text": "No. 4 - have no expectations. You won't be an expert as soon as you start. It can take a long time to become a natural. No. 5 - give yourself permission to fail and to take breaks. Marc stopped knitting for a while when he became frustrated his pieces weren't turning out the way he wanted. Kareemah admits to falling in and out of love with climbing. Thuy refuses to rush a recipe just for the sake of content creation. And the final, most important step - go for it. And if you feel discouraged, remember this."
