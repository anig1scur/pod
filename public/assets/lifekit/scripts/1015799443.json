      "text": "The role of the host, particularly in a group, is incredibly important. You know, when you are meeting with one other person, at some level, there's an element of peers. I mean, you can kind of host one person and they can host you at some - but you're still creating something together. In a group when you're bringing people together, the role of the host is really to connect the group to each other, to connect them to the purpose or the intention, to protect them from each other. You know, if you're bringing together a group of people and one person is kind of taking all of the airtime or one person tends to be dominating the conversation, whatever it is, it's the role of the host to really equalize the group. It's responsibility. It's also a lot of fun or it can be, but the role of the host is really to take care of the life of the group."

I'm a mother, like - and that is true of each person who comes to any type of gathering. But in a group, it's your job as a host to figure out what and how to make everybody there feel like they belong. Very simply, it could be, you know, at a wedding or at a, you know, birthday party. If you are having a dance party, how do you make it as comfortable for the person who wouldn't normally dance to dance or the person who has less access to be able to dance in traditional ways to come and feel included? Like, in every time any group is getting together, there needs to be a context that's set up so that each person, regardless of their many identities, can find a way in."

Maybe I just want to hang out with friends without there being a reason."

      "author": "PARKER",

The biggest mistake we make when we gather is that we assume that the purpose is shared and obvious. You're not taking any joy out of it. You're not making it serious, right? You're simply adding an intention that begins to actually shape the night but also shapes the group."
    },

    },
    {
      "author": "PARKER",
      "text": "Absolutely. Like, the purpose is not, like, a lofty goal. It's a decision-making filter. So often because we haven't paused to think about what is it that I need or what is it that we need, we back into gatherings that tend to be vague and slightly dull. And specificity is a very powerful source of meaning and connection for people."

      "author": "D MOHTASHAM",

    {
      "author": "PARKER",
      "text": "So group size really matters - four to six, but six is a wonderful size for, like, a really connected conversation. It's hard to carry dead weight. So if, like, one person's checked out or two people are kind of checked out or on their phones, like, everyone else really feels it. And it's hard to get the group to kind of, like, take lift. Eight to 12 is a great size for kind of, like, a buzzy dinner party. It's very likely that the conversation would break off into pairs of two or three. Like, you're much more likely to have small group conversations than one big one unless it's kind of facilitated or somebody is really - if people are really kind of primed to focus on the full group. You can absolutely have a lively, big conversation with eight to 12 people. Twenty to 30 feels, you know, more like a party."
    },
    {
      "author": "PARKER",
      "text": "And the last thing I'll just say about size is it's not just that these different sizes are good for different groups and different reasons. They fundamentally affect people's behavior. So if I come into a room - and this is true for almost anybody - what I choose to say in a group isn't dictated by the person in the room with whom I feel most comfortable. It's what I'm willing to say in front of the person who I feel least comfortable, right? And so the composition of the group, the dynamics of the group will give you different evenings. And so, again, it's not bad. It's not good. It's just saying that these are - each of these elements are choices that determine the shape of an experience."

Is this person going to be offended if I don't invite them? As a host and a planner, how do you determine that? Like, what are some things to consider?"
    },
    {
      "author": "PARKER",
      "text": "First of all, I think there's different pressure for - if you're hosting quite often. And so people kind of know - it's kind of like game theory. Like, if you're hosting quite often, it's not that big of a deal if you're not - if, like - if you're cycling through different circles of friends or, you know, peer groups. If it's, like, a wedding - right? - if it's a once-in-a-lifetime event - or, you know, maybe once-in-a-lifetime event - then it starts - the stakes start getting much higher for your - for the community as to who's invited and who's not. So I would just say that as, like, an opening, which is, if you're worried about excluding, host more, not less (laughter), because it actually lowers the stakes of, like, who you're inviting each time. When you have a purpose, it allows you to then back into why you're excluding somebody. If you just if it's kind of a vague party, and you haven't invited some people, and they're like, why didn't you invite me? It's kind of like, eh (ph), you know, well. And then you can kind of..."

      "text": "You can blame it on, well, it was the capacity of the room. But purpose in a different way, if you don't have those external factors, allows for that. So, for example, I had a friend who was - had a reunion. He used to be in the Peace Corps. And casually, informally, a group of friends wanted to get together for a Peace Corps reunion. And one of them, on an email or WhatsApp thread, was like, great. Are - like, are partners invited? And that's the moment when a good gatherer pauses. And instead of saying the knee-jerk, yeah, of course, pause, and says, well, it depends. Why are we doing this? What's the need here? We haven't seen each other in a decade. Are we wanting to reconnect with just ourselves and kind of catch up on old stories, which is one purpose? Or are we wanting to reconnect and bring our - like, the life that we've built since that moment - in which case, absolutely bring partners."
    },
    {
      "author": "PARKER",
      "text": "But this knee-jerk, like, of course, the more the merrier - while it seems like a spirit of generosity, we kind of bulldoze through the intention of a group. And so when you have a purpose - and then you can explain to the partners, actually, this is just volunteers first time, and then we're going to do one with families. So all of this is saying - it's like - it's - because we don't pause and just ask this very simple question ahead of time, what is the need? What do we want the need to be? We end up backing into it in the room, where it is just a lot more messy."

And there are great hosting traditions from those contexts, and the individual can be suppressed. And the way I look at it is, the United States, America, is a - the pendulum has swung the other way. It's a very individualistic society where there are pangs and desire for more of a collective and more of a whole. And the U.S. in and of itself is made up of many cultures and many races, and many of us are biracial or multiracial ourselves, right? Like, we're mixed even internally. And I think that we have a fascinating opportunity to basically really create gatherings where the individual is respected and the group is respected. And that, to me, is the core essence of gathering well."

I know - you may not be - you may not eat meat. You may not do this. But, like, I'm going to come, and I'm going to make chili dogs and serve Coke. Or if you want to have people bring - what was your nostalgia food - right? - as a teenager or as a kid. Bring enough to share with six other people, right? But I'm guiding them through the invitation well ahead. I'm not trying to convince them to eat a hot dog the second they come into the - you know, the door, and be like, where's all the other food?

But otherwise, we try to kind of, like, do all of this in the room, and people don't understand why people are feeling controlled or upset.
