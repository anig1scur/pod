And don't worry - you'll still be hearing them on the show all the time, including LIFE KIT's own Andee Tagle. But you'll also be hearing me a lot now. It's a new era for LIFE KIT. We're turning the page. Kind of exciting, right? OK. The thing is, I am really excited, but it's also a new job, and that's a little stressful. I wrapped up my last job as a reporter and host for Marketplace in mid-August, and I took a few weeks off in between. I went on vacation to Wisconsin, where a friend and I kayaked on Lake Michigan and visited a giant castle filled with cheese. It was fun and super relaxing."

      "text": "But as the first day at NPR approached, there were all these things in the back of my mind. Is the team going to like me? How can I make a good first impression? I'm getting headshots taken. What do I have to do to prepare? I started calling friends and asking for advice. And I realized it was basically LIFE KITTING the start of my job at LIFE KIT. We like to say on LIFE KIT that we bring you all the best experts. For this particular episode, I'm bringing you some of my experts, the people I turn to for advice on the topic - how to start a new job. Think of this episode as an introduction to me but also as a LIFE KIT with takeaways and everything."

Ask for help if you need it. It's OK if you get lost and need to ask a kind co-worker who you bump into for directions or if you have to ask somebody's name twice or whatever. You're not going to absorb everything at once."

To-do - get a map of the building or ask for a tour. It's an idea from a previous LIFE KIT with NYU professor of neuroscience and psychology Wendy Suzuki. And take a deep breath. In a month or two, you will know these things. And finding the kitchen won't be one of the many stresses of your day."

And starting new again - it feels a little like the first day of school. And I'm a transfer student. Someone who knows this feeling well? My cousin Anna. She's 11. And that Tuesday was also her first day of sixth grade."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "There's actually research on something called the liking gap. Essentially, people tend to think their interactions with others go way worse than they actually went, when in reality, the other person we're talking to typically has a positive impression of us. So with that in mind, when you do say hi - I mean, it sounds simple, right? - but just be you."

      "author": "ANNA",
      "text": "Actually, I remember when people were talking to me, and I'd be very fake. Like, that kind of makes them feel like, oh, that's weird. She's weird. You know? So just try not to be, you know, fake. Like, just be yourself, you know?"

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Our conversation made me think a lot about confidence. By my second day at LIFE KIT, we were already making stuff. We recorded an episode on booster shots, started working on this episode. We held planning meetings, recorded promos. I was doing things that I knew how to do, and I think that's really important. You got to find opportunities to get working on the things you feel confident doing, to use the skills you know you have. Of course, taking a seat at the table and sharing your ideas - that can be scary, too. I have found that in those moments, it helps to phone a friend. And that is takeaway number three. When you start a new job and your confidence meter is running low, let your friends support you."

      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "text": "Talking to Erica was a way to remember who I am. And when you're starting a new job, it's easy to forget that you are a full person and also that life is about more than work. Another way to do that - and this is takeaway number four - return to your physical body. Like, there were moments my first week when I realized I was holding my breath. So I would take a big, deep, intentional inhale and exhale - an evergreen tip."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Or during a meeting with our editor, Meghan Keane, I stood up, and I was just like, I got to stretch for a minute while we talk. And we know from previous LIFE KIT reporting all movement counts. Just getting up, sitting back down and then getting up again - that has benefits. I needed to be in a good headspace because I had a big, unfamiliar task ahead - headshots at a photography studio back in New York."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Now, I've had my picture taken before but never quite like this. It was a production. There was hair and makeup, a professional photographer, several different color backdrops. And I was kind of stressed out about it. The day before the photos, I called my friends Liesel and Casey (ph). They're a married couple. They're both long-time actors, and they've had a lot of headshots taken. Liesel told me that I should consider my best colors, the ones that I know look good on me and would complement the backdrop the photographer was using. Also, think about a neckline that I like. But maybe most importantly..."

      "text": "It's just all I want to wear (laughter). So I went ahead and wore it for my last session of headshots, and I thought it worked really well because it was me, you know? And ultimately, that's what you want. Rather than, like, the perfect outfit, you want you to show up in that headshot."

      "author": "CASEY",
      "text": "I think the main thing is, like, at the end of the day, if you look in the mirror and you're like, hell yes, then that's the look you should probably be going with."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "And look. I know not everyone gets headshots taken for their job, but this advice feels relevant even if you're getting a new photo for your ID badge or if you're thinking about what to wear on your first day or during a big presentation. If you are having photos taken, maybe you know this feeling that I expressed to them."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "So I wanted to also talk to you all about the - so the photos are tomorrow. And I still - I'm still trying to get into a headspace where I feel comfortable having my photo taken because I just immediately - when there's a camera on me, I'm like, what do I do with my hands? Or what - like, I just feel so suddenly awkward about everything in my body. I think I get in my head, and I'm like, oh, don't make that one face that you really don't like in photos."
    },
    {
      "author": "CASEY",
      "text": "I mean, let's - first of all, you're going to make the face. So don't try to not make the face. Like, you're going to make a couple of faces during the course of the shots that are that are not your favorite faces, but you're just not going to use those pictures. It's fine."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Liesel also told me that it's less about moving the muscles in your face and more about channeling the energy you want to express. By the way, this is also a good tip if you're preparing for a meeting."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIESEL",
      "text": "I'm not much of a meditator. But, like, if you spend - I don't know - a minute or 30 seconds visualizing something that makes you really happy and glowy, like, you know, probably for me right now, it would be sitting down and just, like, thinking about my 4-month-old laughing, you know? And just thinking about it really hard - it kind of can put - for me, anyway, it can put me in this positive, energetic space that then makes it easier to kind of come with that engaging energy that you want."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Casey suggested that I bring a chocolate chip cookie and take a big bite of it at some point during the shoot because my face lights up when I eat chocolate. And they actually had a lot of tips on how to get ready for photos that we don't have time for in this episode, but we've decided to do a whole other show on that topic, so stay tuned."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Anyway, at the photoshoot, I definitely felt awkward. But eventually, I started to relax. And I've seen the headshots. We got some good ones. I also know that if I did it again, I'd probably do a better job of posing. But I'm trying to remember that that's OK. In a new job, you can't expect to be perfect at everything right away, especially at tasks you've never done before. Even though you want to impress people and remind them why they hired you, it all takes time. Give yourself some grace."

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. So let's recap. When you're starting a new job, have patience with yourself as you get oriented. Ask for help if you need it. Don't worry if you need to ask someone their name twice. In a month or two, these worries will all be ancient history. Also, say hi to people first. I just tried that in the New York bureau today, and it went great. And when you do, be yourself. If you find you need a confidence boost, phone a friend like Erica. Make time to take care of your physical body. Listen to it. Feed it. Give it water. Move it around. And lastly, don't try to be perfect at everything right away, especially the new stuff."
