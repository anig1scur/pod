And estimates are that plastic will remain in the environment for a long, long time. For a plastic bottle, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says, you know, think in terms of 450 years. And that's for one plastic bottle. So what can we as individuals do about this day in and day out?"

So you're going to go to dinner. You're going to eventually see your friends. Bring it up. Share a documentary, a short film, a conversation."

Shilpi stopped buying granola in a plastic pouch and started making her own. Takeaway four - be a conscientious recycler. Don't put things into the recycling bin that don't belong there, like plastic bags and bowling balls."

Tell companies how you feel if the packaging their product comes in can't be recycled. Tell friends what you know about the back story of plastic."

So this way, when you're in a certain section in the grocery store, you know exactly where the items are on your list and you know what to buy. So for me, the top left quadrant is all produce. The top right quadrant is all the packaged items you would buy, like canned goods or pasta or crackers or something like that. The bottom right is dairy. And the bottom left is meat."
