It was like a thank-you card for coming. And it wasn't just a generic, everyone got the same one. And it must have taken him ages, but it was so sweet and so thoughtful.

      "text": "(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, my friend revealed to me that each plate at her wedding costs $500. My boyfriend and I have been together for five months, and she generously gave me a plus-one. Is it true that you should give a gift equal to what the couple spent on you - in this case, a thousand dollars? I was thinking of getting her a gift in the $500 range and asking my boyfriend to pay a third of it. So two questions - is that enough of a gift for her, and is it rude to ask my boyfriend to cover part of the present? Signed, Cheap Date."
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "OK. So part one - that is kind of an old tale that you have to spend what the couple spent on you because that's often not possible for many people, and it's just not true. It's false. You know, at the end of the day, you need to stay within your budget. But interestingly, in 2024 in America, the average person spends $120 on a wedding gift, and then $200 is the average spend for a closer family or friend, depending on how close you are with the couple."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Super interesting. But I want to back up a little bit because I think it's interesting that this friend mentioned this. Is it weird that the friend shared this information to begin with?"
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "Technically, it's not correct etiquette to tell somebody what you're spending on them. So it's - I would advise a couple getting married never to share what they're spending on their guests because it could also make their guests feel guilty."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Right."
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "And it could make their guests feel like they're not giving enough. So that's not really information that you share with people. I think the second part of this - you know, she asked if she should let her date chip in. And my answer to that is no. So I do not think it's fair. I think you are the guest, and therefore, you're bringing a plus-one. That plus-one person really shouldn't be spending anything, you know, toward the gift or, you know, even the hotel. That all should be your responsibility, regardless of your gender. If you're the one being invited, then the plus-one is just your guest. That's just the person accompanying you so you're not alone at a wedding. So I would say do not ask for a chip-in. Just lower the amount to something that you're more comfortable with, and that would be the better play, in my book."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",

      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "You should always bring a gift unless it's a destination. Then you would send the gift back to their home so..."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "OK."
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "...They're not stuck bringing that gift back from an island or something. But you should always send a gift. One of my favorite gifts I got at my wedding was actually - my maid of honor had the place where my husband and I met turned into a watercolor painting, and that's my favorite wedding gift. So I think it's less about money and more about thought - what you think that person would love or that couple. It could be an experience. It could be - and, you know, anything like that that doesn't necessarily have a monetary value, as well."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Gotcha. Just to round it out on the plus-one side of this, what is required of a plus-one when you come to the wedding? Is it just, if you're bringing a plus-one, the plus-one gets to have fun?"
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "The plus-one - really, their job is just to be there and have fun and support you as the person invited. It's your responsibility to tell that person what the dress code is and just let them know timings. They really have no responsibility other than to show up on time, dressed, ready to go and have fun."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "All right. Here's question No. 2."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "(Reading) Dear LIFE KIT, my husband and I are planning our wedding reception. We're both from a traditional Asian background, where parents typically help with organizing and planning. My family is simple and likes low-key celebrations. My husband's family, however, has spent years dreaming about his big, fat wedding, but they haven't taken any initiative in the planning. When asked, they say they don't have any specific expectations, but I'm afraid they'll express disappointment after the event. What's even more frustrating is that, instead of encouraging his parents to voice their opinion, my husband says he doesn't want to be caught in the middle and that the parents should figure it out. Signed, Burned-out Bride."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "First off, strictly from an etiquette standpoint, I want to know - should one family or another be in charge of the wedding, or is that old-school?"
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "That's old-school. So that is no longer considered modern etiquette. So traditionally - and I'm talking, you know, generations ago - the father would give away the bride, would pay for the wedding. That has not been the case for - now for decades. Nowadays, often, couples pay for the weddings themselves. And if a family wants to contribute or can contribute, then they tell the couple what that is, whether it's financial, what if - you know, maybe it's supplying flowers or paying for the rehearsal dinner or decorating. So there's all sorts of different elements here that play into modern weddings today. I should add - the caveat there is it can be cultural. I'm talking more general wedding etiquette in America today, but different religions, different cultures do come into play. So, you know, you do want to take that into consideration, and every situation in every family could be different."

    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "So I think, in this case, the couple should sit down with both the parents - and if one couple's parents are somewhere else, have a good Zoom session - and say, here's what we're planning. Here are the events. Here's how it would play out. We'd love your input. What do you think would make this a more fulfilling day for everybody? Do you have any ideas? We want this to be wonderful and a family union, so we'd love to hear from you - what you think - and give them the floor."

You can't force people. You can lead the horse to water, but you can't make it drink. So I think if you've done everything, then I think you've been a very respectful bride in this situation."

      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "Ugh - well, I think, you know, if a family is contributing greatly or all of the bill, I think they do have some say. You have to be careful about that. You know, I had a friend recently who - the parents were paying for the entire wedding, but they were then saying, and we're inviting all of our friends, and it became not so much her day and more their day."

      "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "author": "MEIER",
      "text": "But they were the ones, you know, planning everything. So I think if they are footing the bill, they do have some say, in my personal opinion. That being said, you might want to have those expectations and those conversations up front. You know, weddings are about combining families. It is about a union, so I think it is important to think about families and what's best for them. But it's your day. At the end of the day, it is your day. So you might have to speak up and say something in a very nice way, polite way - that maybe that's not the vision, or it's getting too big and you want it to be intimate. And I think you have to be open and honest in your communication, but in a - not a hurtful way."

And then if only 70 of those people can come, then they have a second tier that they invite or even a third tier of people, which - hopefully the guests never know what tier they're in.
