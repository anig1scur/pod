Looking at my desk, I see reminder Post-its in every color lining my computer screens, hair ties hanging off the pens in my trusty pen cup, dusty photobooth pictures from a wedding last spring, a leftover candy wrapper from yesterday's afternoon snack and four - yes, four - different water cups and water bottles, amazingly, all half empty, in or around my immediate space. I share this embarrassing, overly cluttered truth with you because I could use some help."

You know, it starts as the utility drawer - you know, batteries, that spare thing of scissors, tape, things like that. And then inevitably, it just gets away from me - every takeout menu, a catchall for my condiment packets or just, you know, napkins. You get the picture. I don't need to go on. But it's a habit that I just can't seem to shake, and it haunts me. What might that clutter be saying to you?"

Like, would you rather get rest, sleep eight hours tonight, or clear your junk drawer? Would you rather, you know, cuddle with your puppy or clear your junk drawer? Like, it's just not a high-priority activity. So that's part of it. So we just want to name that and let it be OK. That ideally stops us from feeling that shame and guilt build up. The second part is - the junk drawer is a great example of an unhoused, you know, graveyard basically. So, like, where do the things go that don't have a home?"

So you holding on to those chopsticks is you saying, I don't want to waste on our beautiful, precious planet. And it's really complicated because we live in a world where to not accumulate excess requires a next level veracity of, like, saying no. And then we wonder why we're all kind of drowning in stuff.

Because every person should be able to behave with their stuff the way that they naturally need to and want to because sometimes people need and want a chaotic energy around them.

What are the rules and guidelines for this room? And this is tricky because a lot of times, we move into the house and we are just, you know, hobbling over that finish line, dragging ourselves by one fingernail to cross.

It doesn't matter if you moved in five years ago or five days ago, taking the time to say, wow, I'm noticing that we are having some incongruence in this room. Can we get on the same page? Because one of the things that's really important is for some people, clutter is not something you're going to just eliminate. You're not going to suddenly become a minimalist. And what we want to do is stop judging people who experience clutter in their lives and who it's part of how they process."

It sounds like I'm very pro-clutter, and in some ways I am. It is OK to have your clutter. It is OK to have a layer of chaos and disorganization in your life. If we can be OK with that, it allows us to stop the shame, stop the judgment, start to see what the root of it is so we can actually have a chance of letting it go. As long as we're judging and shaming and attacking ourselves, that clutter is going to hold tight because we need it, you know, to, like, protect ourselves. But the minute that you can say no, you know, it's OK that it's here, and no thank you to your opinion very much, this is how I'm living my life, and it's my journey and I'm going to walk it on my own - that's a much stronger position for you to be in because then the clutter is your choice."

I don't recommend starting with the most emotional things or paperwork - you know, memorabilia and paperwork are two things that I say, please save that for further down the line because those two tend to be the most emotionally triggering. We are looking at organizing as creating a skill set. Like, most people, if they have recurring clutter, do not feel like they have a handle on the process of organizing. And so you don't want to start, you know, with the most difficult thing first. Like, if you were going to go for a run, you're not going to choose to run the Big Sur marathon at a..."

      "author": "HANSEN",
      "text": "You, like, ease in, yeah. But then the other thing is when we look at how the mainstream world talks about organizing, they're talking about creating systems. They're talking about putting things in a pretty box with a label and giving it a home, right? And oftentimes, they're also talking about letting go of things. So in my experience, those are two very small pieces of a much bigger puzzle. When it comes to getting organized, if you're only trying to do those two things - getting rid of things or setting up systems. You are missing a lot of other really important stuff that creates organization and maintains organization."

All T-shirts go here. All socks go here. So you categorize everything all together. Then, once you've pulled everything out and it's all in categories, then you want to go through each pile and make a decision. Does this stay or go, stay or go? That's what we're kind of looking for, right? And then once you've gone through all the piles, one pile at a time - and we're looking at doing that the easiest to the hardest."

And then once you're done going through everything, you want to take all those things that you're going to get rid of and get them out right then because you want to give yourself that openness, that freedom, that space to think. As long as you're looking at things you already made the decision to get rid of, you're kind of keeping yourself stuck in the past. So get it to the car to be donated or by the door."

OK, great. Well, I want all my T-shirts hung, so you hang your T-shirts. I want all of the jeans folded and put into this bin underneath my bed. Fold it, put it underneath there, label it on all four sides, shove it under there. You're going to go through each category in that way. When we look at the concept of clutter as a whole, it's like one giant blob of chaos versus, oh, what am I going to do with my jeans? What am I going to do with my tank tops? And it becomes easier to dial in to."

What do you want in there that reminds you of you and makes you feel happy? Because no one wants to live in a surplus store, you know? We want to feel personal. So what you want is that when you open that door, when you go underneath the bed, there's something that just makes you feel happy and peaceful and recognize yourself. Because when you decorate or when you kind of personalize a space, it stops you from adding more clutter. There's something about it that we won't kind of defile an area if we feel an endearment to it."

What I always tell people is make your maintenance systems for your laziest day. We all are superheroes when we are well-rested and, like, feeling good. And the truth is what happens when you come home from traveling? What happens when you get the flu? Those are the moments where we really lose our systems because suddenly we've gotten lost because things didn't go according to plan."

You want to give yourself the ability to invest in these things. But on that note, there are a lot of - there's a lot of beautiful and also very expensive ways to get organized these days. You know, I'm thinking about Instagram ads very aesthetic containers and all the videos I see for people's immaculate walk-in pantries? Does decluttering have to come with a price tag?"

We all have bought boxes over the years that then become clutter or, you know, things that we had best intentions with. So, yes, look, the organizing industry is a $12 billion a year industry and growing, right? It's just getting bigger and bigger. So it's an industry, just like anything else, and it wants you to spend money and do all of that. For some people, they really, really want that. You do not need to do that, right?"

But if you're in a small space, you have to have those three questions that I asked you really dialed in. What are the three to five activities you want to do in the space, how do you want it to look and how do you want to feel? You need to live from that like it's your Bible, like nothing exists in that space that isn't in alignment with those values because you just don't have the space for it."

There's infinite options for how you can source things without spending a lot of money. So I'm not saying go and spend a million dollars, but what I'm saying is get clear about what the right solution is. Stop living with the version that doesn't work for you. When you're in small spaces, you don't have the luxury of holding on to something because it's good enough or it used to work. You've got to be very sharp and clear about how you're going to use those spaces and map them out and then find the right things.

So instead of saying, I'm going to take as long as this clutter takes to get organized - because the truth is, you could spend five hours on a pile of clutter, 20 minutes on a pile of clutter or five days on a pile of clutter, and you get to determine how long. So you could say, I'm willing to give this one hour. And in one hour, you just make it better. You don't have to get it completed fully, all the way done, because that's a moving target. You can just say, I'm willing to give this an hour and really give yourself that hour, and do the best that you can."

Or saying, I only have an hour, but I need to walk in this room and boxing things up and stacking it so that it gives you a breezeway, like, a real walkway. And so you really have to notice, like, OK, what is it that I need from this process right now? What kind of resources am I able to devote to it? Because again, we have this idea that we're supposed to, like, get it all done. And it's like, that's not always the case. And what if that's OK? What if this is you accomplishing something very big in small, manageable steps? What if that's enough?"
