And if you're anything like me, you've been spending a lot more time just noticing things like the songs of sparrows outside your apartment window or the purple crocuses bursting into bloom in a nearby park. But did you know those kinds of observations could actually be helpful to scientists? In fact, during the pandemic, as many of us have been forced to stay close to home, we've seen a growing number of people participating in something called citizen science. That's when people like you and me voluntarily collect data out in the world or in our own backyards to help professional scientists study everything from the migratory patterns of butterflies to neighborhood air quality. There are literally thousands of citizen science projects out there waiting to be explored a few clicks away."

They're collecting data to solve environmental justice problems, to address their pollution exposures, really doing science for survival in many cases."

And so really trying to get sensors and data into the hands of folks who are dealing with these cumulative impacts so we can get to actions. That's a core part of our work - is we're on this air quality monitoring and making sure we have better data that can be used in decision-making around how do we reduce hazards - right? - but also where do we invest the dollars?"
