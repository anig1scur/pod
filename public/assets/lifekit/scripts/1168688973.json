Like, debt was at one of its lowest levels of all time - credit card debt. Also, personal savings rate was, you know, near an all-time high. That is completely reversed. Prices have been rising. Government stimulus isn't really happening anymore. And now credit card debt is rising at one of the fastest rates ever."

And I've talked to a lot of people who are struggling with debt right now. And almost every case, there was just a big life event that happened and they couldn't catch back up. I mean, I talked to one woman who had gone through a divorce. She was, like, in sole custody of three little kids under 7. So she had to pay for child care. Child care had gone up by, I think, almost 80% in two years. But it was like, she could not not do that because in order to work and earn a paycheck, she had to pay for child care. You know, she's working. She's trying to get ahead, but her expenses are just outpacing her earning right now. And I think that's true for so many people."

    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "Yes. I mean, so every time you make a payment, you are, every month, with revolving credit - they call it revolving credit because you pay every month. Every month, with revolving credit, you are getting charged 20% on that debt. It compounds incredibly fast."

      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "So you want to tackle that debt first, and you want to start trying to move that debt to places that will charge less interest - trying to get that down. So that way, you're going closest to paying off what they call the principal of your loan, which is, like, the main - the money you actually borrowed is the principal. So, you know, if you have, like, a student loan - a lot of times, student loans have very, very low interest. So most of what you're paying is going to pay off the actual amount you owe. So that, you can pay off more slowly. But if you have, you know, a credit card with a really high interest rate, you want to pay that off first. You want to get rid of that as fast as you can."

      "author": "SEGARRA",

      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "That is one option, yes. So you have a few options. So let's say you look at your debt, you lay it all out on the table and you notice your credit card is charging you 25% interest. Yikes."

You can say things like, I've been a really loyal customer for X number of years or I've made all-on-time payments or I'm trying to get my credit in order. Like, I'd love to continue being your customer and, you know, I'd love for this relationship to continue. What are some options that I have? Find out what's possible first. Let's say they say no, absolutely not, we will not lower your rate."

    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "One thing you can do is look around. A lot of cards right now are offering really, really low rates because there are all these online banks that have started up that are trying to steal people away. So you can find some good deals. And one thing you can do is just find a better deal, pay off the balance on your high interest card with the card with the lower balance. But if you find a card that has a lower interest rate, you can call the card that you have and say, listen, I found this competitor. They're willing to offer me a credit card for X percent. I'd love to stick with you guys. Can you match it?"

You can't always help the interest rate, but a lot of times you can. Just see - try to get a feel for what your options are, try to cut into that interest charge as much as possible 'cause that's the thing that will really keep you from climbing out of debt. It's like interest, when it's that high, is often designed to keep you in debt. So, like, payday loans will sometimes have interest rates of 200%. It's insane."

    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah. And then, I mean, thinking about student loans, they tend to be much lower interest, right?"

    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",

    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "One of the things that can be really hard for people, and a thing that drives them into debt, is that they don't have enough savings for an emergency, right? Like, your car breaks down, and they don't have enough saved up so they put it on a credit card. So if you're thinking about trying to get financially healthy and you have all this debt but then you also want to have some savings for next time, how do you prioritize which one to do? Like, is there a certain amount maybe you should aim to have in savings and then pay down your debt or do a little bit each month? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "That is a really good question. I think it depends on - I mean, if you are dealing with a payday loan that has a huge interest rate, like, I would just get that debt paid off first. And if an emergency comes up, charge it to a credit card. But if you are dealing with student debt, say, I would be like, you should, you know, prioritize having a little cushion - you know? - like, $500 or something like that. So you're not in a scary situation if - because obviously, if you have a little savings, that can prevent you from having to charge stuff to a credit card which has high interest. So you could be saving yourself money in the long run. If it's possible to put a little aside, I think that's always a really, really good idea."

    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "I think it depends on the situation. I think if you have a huge, huge amount of debt - let's say a payday loan where the interest is really out of control - like, you really just need to prioritize paying that off. I would say it's still important to save, if possible. Try to budget in saving, especially if you have an employer who offers a 401(k) or a 403(b) because that is money that you can get for free. I think it's a good idea to not just necessarily be like, OK, must pay down debt, then I'll worry about saving. Do both at the same time if you can, especially if your employer offers some kind of incentive or matching or something like that, because that is money that they're giving you for free."

      "author": "SEGARRA",

    },
    {
      "author": "VANEK SMITH",
      "text": "So one of the things that can be really helpful is just to figure out, you know, an aspirational budget or something, you know? So it's like, OK, I would love to be saving $300 a month. For that to happen, I would need to spend X amount in each category. And one of the trends in budgeting that has kind of resurfaced in recent years, which is very old-school, is something called cash stuffing, which is very interesting. So cash stuffing is essentially - you would get your payment in cash, you get your paycheck in cash, you would have envelopes that - with, like, rent, groceries and you would put the money in the envelope. And once the money was out of the envelope, you did not spend any more money on groceries or going out to eat or whatever it was. You're seeing every charge. You're feeling it. It's going through your hands."

She thought about, like, this food has to last me for two weeks. So it's like - it's just a little bit of a different mentality. And she was paying down $18,000 worth of credit card debt. She's paid down 5,000 of it. But, you know, she..."

And she said it was like - she felt so ashamed. But then she said the second she started looking at it and, like, put it all out on the table, she's like, it came down so fast.

If you have other credit card offers, use them as leverage. Call your credit card company and ask them to match the lower interest rate. Try to save while you're paying down debt, even if it's the tiniest amount every month. That way you'll have money set aside for emergencies, and you won't have to put those charges on a credit card in the future. If you do have extra cash and you're deciding whether to invest in a retirement plan or to pay down your debt, think about your loan interest rates, and also think about whether your employer offers to match your retirement contributions because, you know, that's free money. So with this one, you really have to weigh the pros and cons."
