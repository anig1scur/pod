But when you actually drill down into the research, it's just hard to draw conclusions because all the studies are done differently. The protocols are different, the temperatures are different, there are a lot of different elements here. And so at the moment, you'll see a lot of hype out there, but many of these claims aren't backed in a kind of a rigorous way by science."

    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "Yeah. That's right. There is a first kind of physiological reaction you have, which is called the cold shock response. This is when your body basically freaks out. You know, your heart rate jumps, your blood pressure spikes, it activates your fight-or-flight response. This is the - called the sympathetic arm of your nervous system. You'll have a release of, like, stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. But over time, if you do this as a practice somewhat regularly, there is science showing that you can basically train your body to not have so much of a freak out. You'll still have an effect, but it will be less intense. And while the science is still pretty early, as I mentioned, scientists do believe that, you know, some of the benefits that we see specifically around mental health has to do with that first, intense, this cold shock response that you have to kind of deal with and encounter when you first get in."

      "author": "STONE",

And actually, that is one of the ideas that's put out there about some of the possible, you know, improvements that we see in mental health is just the idea that you've overcome a challenge and you've kind of developed some resilience in the process. And so hopefully, the cold-water immersion is training - I mean, that's one idea is kind of training yourself to better handle these stressful moments."

    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "So I would say the evidence is still pretty thin. We have some small, preliminary studies. We have anecdotes. But I do see it as one of the most promising areas of research. There's a - one small study from the U.K. that shows even a quick dip in the cold water can improve your mood. And this one study on mood found it didn't really matter if it was five or 10 or 20 minutes in the water, it all seemed to help - about have the same effects. And I would say some of the best work is coming from this group of researchers in the U.K. One of them is named Dr. Mark Harper. He's a anesthesiologist and researcher, and he has helped run a study that had about 50 people, and they basically wanted to see if just eight sessions in the ocean would have a meaningful impact on depression and anxiety."

And depending on which measure you use, something between 60 and 80% went from a diagnosis to not having a diagnosis anymore. Again, you know, there's always ups and downs. You can't say it's a cure as such but it really helps people go from nonfunctional to functional."

      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "But, you know, one reason we kind of - he's cautious here is that it was a small basically pilot study, and it actually gave them, you know, enough to go off of so that they could now embark on this much bigger, large, randomized, controlled trial with more than 400 people. And hopefully, that trial will help us understand, give us some solid evidence to show, hey, this actually can be helpful."

      "text": "What are the other health benefits that there's evidence for?"
    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "So one area that is actually pretty well developed in terms of, like, cold exposure research is on metabolic health. And we've seen a number of studies on this over the last 10 years. And basically, the most solid finding is that it can help with regulating blood sugar - your ability to manage blood sugar. And I like to kind of compare this to exercise, because we know that after exercise, you'll have improvements in your ability to manage blood sugar. And in the same way, they also see that after cold exposure, your body does better maybe for the next 24 hours, maybe 48 hours. So one researcher who has been studying this is Denis Blondin, he's a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada. He actually said that in some of the research they've seen, you can have better improvements than you see after exercise. But the key here is you have to shiver to get the most benefits."
    },
    {
      "author": "DENIS BLONDIN",
      "text": "And so because we're relying on these muscles that are shivering and contracting, that's where I think we see a lot of the benefits of the cold is because you've got these contractions that are similar to what you would have with exercise, but the difference that you have with the cold versus exercise is that the muscles that are recruited, it's kind of all over the place. It's everywhere."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "OK. I'm wrapping my head around that."
    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "So basically it's - you're getting a workout, right? And I think that's one way to think about being exposed to the cold."
    },
    {
      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Oh, OK."
    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "I definitely know that the idea of shivering sounds terrible - used to sound terrible, but I kind of - after I had that in my head, when I go out there and then I come back, you know, from the water, and I'm shivering a bit, I just think, OK, my muscles are working. It's just a different kind of workout, and somehow it makes it more tolerable. And I do want to say, like, a big caveat with this research on metabolic health is that these studies have been done usually in cold air or, like, with these special cooling suits that Blondin and others use in their labs. And people sometimes, like, spend hours, but it's not as cold as getting into, like, a freezing body of water. So we don't really know how all of that data translates into, you know, a five-minute dip cold plunge. But it is one area that has been studied more than other areas when it comes to cold exposure."

    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "Yeah. And that's kind of the first thing as you embark on your cold plunging journey is really take it seriously, because like I said, cold is an intense physiological stressor. You have this cold shock response, you basically want to make sure that if you're just getting into this, especially, that you don't do it alone and that you have someone there to kind of look out for you, especially if you're doing it in, you know, like, in a lake or in the ocean. And another thing to keep in mind..."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "...Along with hypothermia and these other kind of obvious risks is this phenomenon called the after drop. Essentially, what happens when you get in the water is your body is going to try to defend itself. It's going to push it's warm blood to your core, and it's going to be OK with maybe sacrificing your extremities like your hands and your feet. But when you get out of the water, you know, your blood vessels will dilate, and that cold blood that was in your extremities will start to recirculate into your core. And this will actually create this phenomenon where you may start to feel even colder right after you get out of the water and start shivering intensely because your body is trying to kind of, you know, regulate what's happening here."
    },
    {
      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "So I would say you want to have a plan for when you get out of the water to stay warm. It's also usually recommended that when you get out of the water, you - instead of just jumping into a hot shower, which is the temptation, you want to move around a bit. You want to try to heat yourself up from the inside, and then that actually will help you, you know, deal with that immediate effect."

What I heard over and over from the researchers were - was that more is not better. I spoke to Francois Haman, who's at the University of Ottawa, about this because it's something he sees - when he goes out with cold-plunging, cold-swimming groups, he kind of sees this mistake that people make."

I will tell you, when I did talk to the researchers like Haman, they all said, you know, you shouldn't probably make this an everyday event, because it is a big stress on your body and it would be kind of like going to the gym every day and trying to do your heaviest lift or trying to run your fastest sprint. You don't want to do it all the time. So the general guidance was maybe, you know, once or twice a week."

      "author": "SEGARRA",
      "text": "Yeah. Did they have any advice on how to fit this into an exercise regimen? Like, if you should do it on a day that you're doing some form of exercise or if you should do it on a rest day or have a rest day right after?"

      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "The studies do show that it consistently helps people with soreness, and you also just hear that from people. I experience it, too, even when I do the cold plunges. I don't feel as sore after I do it. But what is interesting is that only recently have we realized that it's actually probably not the best thing to do if your goal is to build strength or build muscle. And this actually comes from a study that was done where they looked at, you know, what happened to some young people who did some weightlifting and then did the cold plunging. And they even did, like, muscle biopsies to look at what was happening in the muscle. And they found that basically, when you, you know, top off your workout - your strength training workout with cold plunging, it does inhibit your muscle and strength gains a bit. It's not - you know, it's not like it doesn't - it just totally wipes it out. But the researcher I spoke to who did the study said, you know, 10 to 20%."

      "author": "STONE",
      "text": "No. The researchers I spoke to said we just don't have the evidence around that yet. I would say the colder you do it, you will get more of that intense adrenaline response. You'll get that intense cold shock. Some people want that. Other people - maybe that's just not what they want to do, or maybe that's not what they want to do all the time. And I was actually speaking to Francois Haman about this since, you know, he's studied this for, like, two decades. He says that he only does maybe an extreme cold plunge a couple times a month. He actually calls it ice dipping, and he's in Canada, so it's probably even more intense up there."

      "text": "But what he does do is that on other days, he'll basically take a cold shower, or he will fill up his bathtub the night before and just let it sit overnight, and then he'll jump into it in the morning. And so maybe it's about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. And he says, you know, you're still going to get a cold shock response. It's just going to be not nearly as intense as if you were in, like, 40-degree water. But he kind of sees it as a way to wake himself up, get his metabolism going. He said it's basically, you know, his morning cup of coffee."

If you're looking for another tool to help manage depression or anxiety or just to let off some steam, cold plunging could be it. Just be safe about it, and make sure you have a buddy if you're trying it in open water. Start with a 30-second plunge at first, and then slowly work your way up. You don't need to push yourself to get the benefits, and that also goes for how often you plunge. Start incorporating it into your schedule once a month, and see how that feels."

If you're not near a lake or an ocean, a cold bathtub that's around 70 degrees Fahrenheit can do the trick. The key is to make sure you're shivering to get the most health benefits. Have a plan for when you get out of the water to help with the after drop - towels, blankets. Maybe move around a bit and warm yourself up from the inside before you hop in a hot shower. And lastly, cold plunging is safer and more enjoyable with a group. Find one in your area if you want a community to help you get started."
