      "text": "This is NPR's LIFE KIT. And I'm reporter and supreme Halloween enthusiast Andee Tagle. Are all you cool ghosts and goblins ready to party with me - theme party, that is? Spooky season is upon us. It's my favorite time of year for lots of reasons - the singular thrill of haunted hayrides with friends, pumpkin carving, scary movie marathons. Plus, eating buckets of candy is actually encouraged this time of year. Don't you threaten me with a good time, holiday-makers."

      "text": "But, hands down, my favorite part of Halloween is the costumes and the parties that go with them. I find it so satisfying to spend a week or two making a homemade costume, getting to be creative and then getting that big reaction as I walk through the door of a party. Like most recently, I was Lord Farquaad from the \"Shrek\" movies, accompanied by my husband as perhaps the world's largest gingerbread man. It was hilarious, if I do say so myself, and something that our friends still talk about a year later. And that's the power of a good theme party. It ups the ante for a social gathering."

But maybe you're the lone enthusiast in a crowd of naysayers - you know, those too-cool-for-school kids that can't be bothered to dress up just for the heck of it. We can help with that. It comes down to making your theme party fun for everyone involved, an approach that shouldn't just be reserved for Halloween."

They give everyone involved something to look forward to - a chance for surprise or to dip into nostalgia, a time to think outside the box and, perhaps greater than all of these, space to belong and create lasting memories. The only question is, where do you start? In this episode of LIFE KIT, we'll help you throw a successful theme party your way. We'll talk how to pick a theme, how to make it come alive and how to get your guests to buy in - no RSVP required."

But choosing just the right one can be much easier said than done. Food and entertainment reporter Brandi Milloy has built a following around her simple and fun approach to food and hosting. She says if you're struggling to find the right theme, start with your own party-going preferences."

      "text": "For example, when Brandi was pregnant with her daughter, she knew she didn't just want an ordinary baby shower - you know, a standard, tame afternoon where everyone sat politely and watched her open presents. Instead, she decided to choose a creative menu as her theme."
    },

      "author": "MILLOY",
      "text": "So I had this cravings menu, and it was everything I had been craving my entire pregnancy, from Chick-Fil-A nuggets to sweet tea to sour-belt candies to a cereal bar because I couldn't get enough of just cold milk and cereal. And there were, like, little touches everywhere in the party where people were, like, oh, my gosh, that is so you, and this is like no other baby shower I've ever been to."

    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "And that brings us to our first takeaway. Takeaway one - pick a theme that can act as a third guest or an additional host for your party. What do I mean by that? You should think of your theme like that ultra-fun friend you can always rely on to help get a party going for you - you know, the one you ask to come by early to help set up and set the tone when the other guests arrive. Your theme should work in the same way. Like Brandi's cravings menu, your theme should be a conversation starter, something to get people excited and give your guests common ground and shared activities to connect over. Some examples of that could be with tried-and-true themes, like \"The Great Gatsby\" or partying through the decades, a casino night for a 21st birthday, perhaps, or a Super Bowl potluck."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Natasha says to consider the mix of people you plan to invite to your party and adjust the scope of your theme accordingly. So if you want to throw a party dedicated entirely to the fifth season of \"Game Of Thrones,\" for example, good for you. That sounds awesome. But before you go passing out invitations in an exact replica of Margaery Tyrell's wedding outfit, maybe make sure to limit your guest list to other superfans. Otherwise, you might find yourself disappointed in your guests' lack of enthusiasm, and your guests might feel excluded by your specificity. That said, don't be scared to introduce friends to your passions if they offer broad party entertainment appeal. Brandi, for example, used to compete in pageants."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "I'm sure I don't have to harp on this one too much for you, but let's just do better when we know better, folks. OK? There are so many fun ideas out there that require absolutely no cultural appropriation - glow-in-the-dark parties, slumber parties, tea parties, the letter T parties. That's the one where everyone dresses up as something starting with the letter T. It's a blast. The inoffensive list of themes is just far too long to even need to consider dabbling in something offensive. And how do you know if you're toeing the line? Well, if you have to ask whether or not a theme or costume is appropriate, better just to steer clear."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Other than that, don't be scared to tinker and play. What about a doppelganger party for that bestie that's always getting mistaken for Olivia Rodrigo or a Patrick Swayze movie marathon for your movie-loving brother named Patrick? Have fun with colors or playlists or sporting events. Riff off of your favorite book or movie genres. Like both pirates and space? Why not a space pirate theme? As long as you plan ahead and your guests know what they're in for, the sky - or the sea - is the limit. And that's our second takeaway for planning a great theme party - set expectations and give guests plenty of notice. If you're listening to this a week before Halloween in order to throw the world's best costume soiree, I'm afraid you're a little late to the planning party, my friend."

Yeah, don't put yourself or your guests through that pain. Plan for what you want and then make the ask early. You want to give people enough notice not to just be able to attend but to prepare, especially for the big holidays when you might have competition."

      "author": "TAGLE",

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Make sure people know what's being asked of them in clear language. Does everyone at the bachelorette need to wear black from head to toe, or is some accessory variation allowed? Are costumes required for entry or just strongly encouraged? For your dynamic duos party, can everyone come up with their own interpretation of a famous pairing? Or are we only talking celebrities and historical figures? Note any important information on your original invitation. Then remind people again."

Maybe you could send out your first invite on some Hogwarts-esque stationery, then follow up with people about the theme with Dumbledore-adorned GIFs, asking your guests if they have any questions about what house they're sorted into for trivia. Maybe you can make it a costume contest with butterbeer and a chocolate frog waiting for the winner as a way to get people excited. And most people probably will be. But you should also be prepared for questions and pushback."

So takeaway three - thoughtfulness over things will take you far. Be focused and intentional with your party planning funds. Listen. Tempting as it may be to buy out all of Party City or the Oriental Trading Company catalog once you have a theme you're excited about, Natasha says you don't really need to bombard your guests with your theme in every corner to get your point across. She suggests aiming for about five touchpoints to make your theme feel full and real without being over the top. What does that look like? Well, you could start with themed invitations, catering..."

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "So pick the things that most communicate the theme to you and then focus on that. If you're throwing a Halloween party, for instance, maybe you have a spooky witch's brew punch in a cauldron and a table of spooky desserts to match. Cool. Then you don't really have to opt for the jack-o'-lantern-themed napkins too. What does overdoing it look like? Brandi says one telltale sign is letting a lot of cheesy stuff and fluff aggressively tell the story of the theme for you."

      "author": "MILLOY",
      "text": "For example, I went to a party, and you could tell the person was really set on this Paris theme. They wanted the black and white, the straws, the napkins, everything was Paris, Paris, Paris.

Takeaway two - set expectations, and give guests plenty of notice. Planning on a costume contest? Want to make it a potluck? Invite guests at least six weeks in advance, and start prep then, too. Takeaway three - be focused and intentional with your party planning funds. You don't have to break the bank or go overboard with decor to make a theme come to life. It's thoughtfulness that counts. Takeaway four - make it easy for people to participate in your theme, but don't force it.
