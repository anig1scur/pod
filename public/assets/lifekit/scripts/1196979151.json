  "intro": "When was the last time you got lost in a book? These days, the act of 'deep reading,' or reading with intention, can be difficult to practice. Maryanne Wolf, an expert in the science of reading, explains what we lose when we skim \u2014 and how to create an environment conducive to deep reading.",

Ever since I was a kid, through college as a literature major, and especially now, when every book I read is competing with my phone for my attention, it's always a fight to achieve that level of locked-in, deep reading. It turns out I was born this way, and so were you."

They don't have a genetic program for reading the way we do for language and vision and even affect. Everything has these genetic programs. It's just not the way reading is because it's an invention. It doesn't exist in our brain. Rather, we have to learn it. And that means our brain has to make a new circuit."

And at the heart of it is the point where we, the reader, go beyond the wisdom of the author to discover our own. Deep reading is when we enter that space. I call it home. I call it sanctuary. Kishjen (ph), my dear novelist friend, calls it the space of interiority. It is that place where only we can go to think at our deepest, best, even most disciplined level about our insights and our associations, our reflections."

And part of the distractions that I worry most about are not the kind that you said - the hunt for the Cheerio box - but rather the distractions that are intrinsically built into our laptops and our phones in which we really have our attention pulled away. The screen itself is a source of attention disruption. And by that I mean we have so much information that we have a built-in defense mechanism. We skim. And when we skim, we have two very common patterns."

Or - and this is my particular pattern - we do the top, and then we just diagonally zigzag down. We're word-spotting. We're browsing. We're, you know - and then we get to the bottom, and then we read the conclusion and feel virtuous. The reality is that skimming is one of the greatest disruptions of deep reading. Both skimming because it's a defense mechanism because we have to get all this information - just like you did with my book. And then there's the - I would say the environmental world that we live in is so full of distractions. So we are awash in distraction in our worlds."

      "author": "WOLF",
      "text": "So the first change that I would suggest in our habits is going to be a difficult one. If you are not forced to be on the screen, then the real agency you have is to ask the question, what is the purpose of this reading? If the purpose is to experience the beauty of an author, if you are doing it on the screen, I assure you, even with your most disciplined habits, you're going to miss - you're going to skim no matter what because that's what we do. We're so accustomed to skimming. So if the purpose is beauty, forget the screen. If the purpose is a contract or something legal that you really need to ponder and pore over, or in my case, often reviewing an article. If I've decided I have to do this article as a review that's careful, I print it out because print does not hasten us. Print goes according to our own pace."

      "author": "WOLF",

And when you only need the gist, you can just, you know, use whatever medium you want. But if you want to really go back to your reading habits before the screen, before you became almost a skim reader, then I ask you to really think hard about your choices."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Takeaway two is screens are fine if you're skimming. But if you want to deep-read, you have a better chance of minimizing distractions if you read on paper. Like she says, prints allows us to go at our own pace.

And what I had to do is what I'm going to tell your listener. For two weeks, I forced myself to read 20 minutes a day - only 20 minutes - as if I was just going to force myself to try to be that older version of a reader. And then it was like coming home to my old self - my old reading self."

I, you know, I'm going to scandalize some of your listeners who must probably, like I do, love \"Siddhartha.\" But the fact is \"Siddhartha\" can be read a lot faster than \"Narcissus And Goldmund\" or \"Glass Bead Game\" or poetry. Poetry requires a different pace, too. So I ask your reader to - if they really are serious, you can discipline yourself and return to yourself."

And I think this is a - it's a good question that you're asking me because I, who had once loved this and appreciated it, was quite capable of rejecting it now because of my new skimming reading mode. My brain didn't want to give that kind of time to every word, to the sentences, to the build-up, to the evaluation, to the monitoring of my comprehension. I didn't want to do this because you have a - built up a desire that's almost affectively saying, hurry up. Get through this. Get to the bottom of the page or the bottom of the screen. Move on - instead of entering and thinking about the beauty or sometimes the negative feelings that a character elicits in you."

Try hard to realize that you are fighting against your own habit here and that this - it's almost like when you learn any discipline. And it's interesting that you said the \"Rocky\" mode. You are absolutely having to practice muscles that have atrophied. So your exercise metaphor is apt for learning how to read again at a deep level. You're practicing."

And I will say, you, Andrew, can see the beautiful painting behind me, but, you know, your listeners can't. Well, that is a painting by my son, Ben Wolf Noam, who is dyslexic. And he can read, but at a pace that he has to determine. And it's slower, but many people read more slowly. But I will never forget him deciding - because he knew I loved this book - to read \"Brothers Karamazov\" one summer. It took him the entire summer. But it was his pace. And, of course, the book demanded a slower pace, too, but it was his pace. And I have no doubt that he was reading deeply his pace."

There is more memory that consolidates than we have immediate, perceptible access to. On the other hand, when we skim, we consolidate less because we are using less affect, less evaluation - and I will add this - less motor, which sounds ridiculous."

I actually think the motoric aspect of taking notes helps you. And so I almost - there's nothing that's truly important to me that I haven't bought as a book or printed out as an article. And then those notes are twofold. I write along the margin, and then I write in the back of the book the pages of the most important insights for me. The back cover of my books has pages with words that say insight into love, let's say, or digital or whatever it is. Then when I return, I know automatically where I really need to go."

      "text": "We lose two best thoughts - the author's and our own. And you see; the real beauty is that we discover ourself. Deep reading, at its ultimate, is a place of discovery of other, a discovery of beauty and a discovery and even appreciation for our ability to think outside the bounds of our everyday lives."

      "text": "OK, recap time. Takeaway one - if you're having a hard time deep reading, understand that our brains aren't meant to deep read. As Maryanne puts it in her first book, reading reflects the brain's capacity for going beyond the original design of its structures. We're breaking new ground here, people. It's supposed to be hard."

      "text": "Takeaway two - reduce distractions. Yes, that includes the phone you're probably listening to this on. Chuck it in a drawer and give an old-fashioned paper book a shot."

      "text": "Takeaway three - Deep reading is a discipline. If you want it, you're going to have to make time for it. It doesn't have to be too much time. I mean, life happens, but make deep reading something you can practice regularly."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Takeaway four - read at your own pace and the book's pace. Sometimes, deep reading means you're not crushing dozens of books a month or whatever. Take the time to really engage with what the author is saying."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "And what helps with that is takeaway five - writing it down. Whether it's in the margins or your own notebook, write down the thoughts you're having as you read, and your own motor skills will help you think about and engage with what you're reading. And that's it. A big thanks to my guest, Maryanne Wolf. I will let you know if I ever do give \"Siddhartha\" another shot."
