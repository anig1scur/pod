I was kind of grumpy as I was, like, tromping into the store once I finally, like, opened the door. And I just - I don't know, I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it after I left, and it just made me feel kind of bad. I don't know."

And hearing, like, don't take it personally, Diana, or it's not about you when it totally feels like it's about you - it's easier said than done, like, particularly when I'm, like, feeling hurt or just confused by someone's words or actions and just, like, you know, caught up in my feelings. At the end of the day, someone not opening a door for me is not a big deal. Right? We all experience small things like that from time to time, but we also have conversations with friends, co-workers and family that have higher stakes, that are bigger deals. I reached out to psychology professor Ethan Kross to try to help me wrap my head around why we take things personally in the first place. Kross teaches at the University of Michigan, and he runs their Emotion and Self Control Laboratory."

But before any of us take a seat at our proverbial pity party and say or do something that we may regret, Kross says to remember to pause. That's takeaway No. 1.

    {
      "author": "SANA POWELL",

If we feel hurt, we might feel like we want to hurt them back or prove ourselves in some way. And so I would say the first step is, instead of responding right away, to consider the entire situation and think about could there be other things going on here that would make this not just about me?"

    {
      "author": "KROSS",
      "text": "What makes them toxic, though, truly toxic from a health point of view, is when our negative emotional responses get activated and then they remain chronically activated over time. This is precisely what ruminating about an experience does to us. And the consequence for our health is this - that long-term activation of a negative emotion, that exerts a wear and tear on the body that we're not built to accommodate."
    },
    {
      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "This is why it's essential to pause. Pausing gives us a chance to think more carefully about what's going on and slow down that hamster wheel or not get on it in the first place. It also paves the way for takeaway No. 2 - try something called mental distancing. Take some time to distance yourself from the comment or behavior that is making you feel bad so you aren't stuck in your feelings. Chicago-based clinical psychologist Adia Gooden says there are things we can do each day to help us practice the technique of distancing in order to minimize how much time we spend ruminating. She says having practices that help ground you can help stop you from spiraling."

Maybe it's taking walks, something that gets you present. And if you make that a habit, it's going to be easier to sort of carry that into your day."
    },
    {
      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "Gooden also shared that part of distancing is letting go of control."
    },
    {
      "author": "GOODEN",
      "text": "So when we worry that everything is about us, we tend to think, oh, well, maybe if I acted differently, they would act differently. And yes, like, if we're really kind and pleasant, people are probably more likely to be kind and pleasant back to us. But sometimes, that's not the case, right? Sometimes, we can be as kind and pleasant as we want and somebody is in a bad mood, and they are just going to have an attitude with us."
    },

      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "Professor Kross also suggests something called distanced self-talk."
    },
    {
      "author": "KROSS",
      "text": "It involves using your name and the second-person pronoun you to coach yourself through an event. Why does this work? Think about when we use names and words like you. We use these parts of speech when we think about and refer to other people. So the links in your mind between using a name and thinking about someone else is very, very strong. And so the idea is that when you use your own name to weigh in on your problems, that's providing you with a sense of objectivity. It's reducing your sense of self-involvement."
    },
    {
      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "I know this may sound strange, but it's worth a try. For example, instead of recounting the gas station story to myself in the first person, I would say something like Diana felt a little frustrated when a person didn't hold the door for her, but there's a good chance that other person didn't see her, and it's not a big deal. Another thing to try - look at the big picture, like the really big picture. Here's professor Kross again."
    },
    {
      "author": "KROSS",
      "text": "Think about how are you going to feel about this tomorrow, next week, next month, 10 years from now? If none of those work, you can always do the ultimate temporal distancer, which is how are you going to feel about this when you're dead?"
    },
    {
      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "Kross says asking yourself those questions can help get you out of a chatter loop. OK, so let's say you're taking something personally. You paused and acknowledged your feelings and distanced yourself in order to see the whole picture, maybe with some distance self-talk. After all that, you may decide to just let things go and move on. But maybe this is a situation where, even after you've recentered yourself, you'd like to give some feedback. Whether it's because you want to maintain a relationship or you just don't want to be treated a certain way, it's up to you to decide when it's a good idea to do our next piece of advice. So if you think it's worth the emotional labor to clear the air, it's time for takeaway No. 3 - try to seek clarification. When we take something personally, it's usually due to a miscommunication and the story we have put together in our head. Here's therapist Sana Powell with why."
    },
    {
      "author": "POWELL",

      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "Having a clarifying conversation can be hard. You may be uncomfortable, and the whole thing may be super awkward. Things can feel even more complicated if you come from a marginalized identity and are looking to speak to someone in a position of power or privilege. Powell offers one approach."
    },
    {
      "author": "POWELL",
      "text": "For example, hey, when you said that thing or when you did that thing, this is how I interpreted it. Is that correct? Or am I missing something here? And it takes courage to be able to do that because it means making yourself vulnerable and even admitting like, hey, this affected me. When you did or said that, that impacted me, and I'm in my feelings about it. And so I want to talk about it."
    },
    {
      "author": "OPONG",
      "text": "This helps the person see how their words or actions are impacting you, and hopefully that means that maybe they'll change their behavior in the future. Seeking clarity can also prevent more negative messaging from entering our minds. Kross says our minds are really good at absorbing negative thoughts and creating stories."
    },
    {
      "author": "KROSS",
      "text": "We often tell stories to ourselves, and your inner voice helps you do that. So those are all the wonderfully positive sides of your inner voice. You don't want to get rid of it for those reasons. But then there's this dark side, which you and I and I'm guessing many listeners are familiar with, which is bad things happen, bad experiences, losses, rejections, anger-provoking events, anxiety, envy. You fill in the negative experience."

For example, let's say your partner is always on their phone at dinner time, and it makes you feel like they don't care to connect.

But I was curious if there was a way to preemptively take things less personally, you know, armor up a bit in advance. Gooden says there is power in growing our confidence. She helps people believe that they are unconditionally worthy and has our fourth and final takeaway - build up your self-worth."

      "author": "GOODEN",
      "text": "When we're looking for other people to affirm our worth, then any little thing they do either feels like it confirms or disconfirms whether or not we're worthy, right? So if they're rude, then oh, my gosh, I must not be worthy of respect, right? If they're nice, OK, I feel great, right? But we're sort of dependent on other people and how they respond to us for our sense of worthiness. If, in contrast, we're grounded in the fact that we're unconditionally worthy, then if somebody doesn't treat us that way, we can say, OK, well, I don't know what's going on with them. I know I'm worthy of love, care and respect, so I'm not going to spend time around this person. Or I'm going to talk to this person about that, but I'm not going to think their behavior makes me unworthy."

And something I always do if you have a scratchy throat is that after I'm done steeping my tea, when I would normally mix honey in or something of that nature, I also drop in my favorite cough drops, and I'll just stir that in. It'll melt along with everything else. And then that way you don't have to suck on a lozenge or do whatever else. You just get that nice, soothing feeling as you finish your cup of tea."
