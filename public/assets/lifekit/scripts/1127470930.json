Tricia founded a project called The Nap Ministry back in 2016, and she uses performance art and social media and photography. She even has a hotline to promote the healing power of rest. And now she has a book out called \"Rest Is Resistance.\" And Tricia says she wants it to be a balm for an exhausted world."

I don't usually start my interviews talking about how tired I am, but Tricia really encourages her overworked readers and her IG followers to acknowledge that we're exhausted and that we have the right to rest. So here goes. I'm so tired. I don't know how to say no. I know you've heard this a million times. I definitely am one of those people who operates from a scarcity mentality that I was 100% raised with - shoutout to my Puerto Rican mom and my Iranian dad."

And I'm on his shoulders, and he's smiling. And it's just the epitome of the relationship that we had. He was always holding me up - like, whatever you could do - always teaching me you're enough. He really was one of the people who I could look to, to know that even though my body and my skin color was being criminalized in the culture, he was always responding by saying, it's a lie. You are enough. Your Blackness is a miracle. Like, he was an activist, union organizer, Pentecostal, fire-and-brimstone Black preacher. So I dedicated the book to him because I think, in a lot of ways, my work with The Nap Ministry and experimenting with it was because of him, you know? So I wanted to uplift him, to say thank you for being my biggest supporter."

But you may not get any work for me. And so I just started resting everywhere. I had all these special places to sleep all over campus. And I would also sleep when I got home. Instead of studying, I would lay down on the couch and put the book on my chest and just go to sleep. I wasn't staying up no more 'til 3 in the morning, like my classmates. I just - I said, I don't care. I said, let the chips fall where they may. I have to save myself. And rest became the vehicle to see what my body would do and what could happen when I went into a dream space, when I went into a portal of resting, when I decided to just lay down."

It's a full-on politics of refusal. We have been brainwashed by this system to believe these things about rest, about our bodies, about our worth - this violent culture that wants to see us working 24 hours a day, that doesn't view us as a human being, but instead views our divine bodies as a machine."

It isn't one way. There's never just one way. There's infinite ways that we can find liberation. And so for me, when we are on - in a system that we're on that's under capitalism, that doesn't look at people as people - they look at profit. White supremacy - they don't see the divinity in all of us."

You've been hearing about this idea of quiet quitting, where people are going to work but not giving as much?"

I tell people to rest through the guilt, rest through the shame because to me, the guilt and shame is just beautiful evidence of your brainwashing. And give thanks for that because you didn't even know you were brainwashed before. You know what I mean? You thought this was normal. You thought everybody around you, the whole entire culture, is moving at this pace. And so take it slow.

So I know the beauty of looking at this message from the science of sleep. The CDC have named sleep deprivation as a public health crisis. Three of the top diseases - high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes - can be linked back to sleep deprivation. And so when we aren't sleeping, our organs don't have a chance to regenerate. And then from a brain level, our brains are being truly traumatized by our lack of sleep and lack of a moment of pause."

And you're able to, like, really heal your body. So I tell people, maybe this work can't land in your mind and spirit from a political level. Maybe you can't right now jump on the whole spiritual idea of it. But just to look at what is happening from a health level, from biologically, from neurologically, what we're doing to our bodies when we're exhausted, when we're burnt out - over a sustained amount of time, it is killing us. It is causing more disease to take root in our bodies. It's not allowing us to live to our full potential."

It's addictive. So do it slowly. Find ways to do it weekly. Put it in your calendar. You have to be subversive, inventive. And you have to create and craft a way."

There is just a moment where I'm not on capitalism's clock. Like, my dad would wake up in the morning two hours before he had to go to work and read every newspaper because he loved newspapers. He loved reading. And I would be like, why are you up so early? You don't have to be at work. He was like, I want to get up and be human for a little bit and actually not be on the clock and do what I want to do."

He was this organizer and activist. So this work, in a lot of ways, is also dedicated to organizers and social justice activists like myself and like my dad, and like a lot of people in my life who feel like they can't rest while the machine continues to rage around them, you know? How can we ever take a break when they're continuing to lock up people and put them in prisons? How could I stop when they're, you know, continuing to make laws that are, like, taking away women's autonomy? Like, how do we rest?"

And it's not a luxury. And it's not some afterthought. It truly is something that will allow us to tap into the inventive and imaginative ideas that are going to get us to the next dimension. I talk about in the book, I don't think my dad knew what a hobby was or what leisure was or a vacation was, and how once you're on this wheel, once you're on this wheel of grind culture, it sometimes can be impossible to unravel from it.
