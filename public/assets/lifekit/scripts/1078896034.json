The way he sees it, life is going to throw you curveballs at some point. Why not get in some practice swings when you can?"

Find ways to self-soothe or talk to someone you trust. Takeaway two - a loss doesn't have to be the end of the story. Be growth-minded. Takeaway three - pobody's nerfect (ph), so don't beat yourself up. Once you've gotten out of your head, get honest feedback to create a clear game plan for the future. Takeaway four - perseverance is a muscle you flex in every avenue of life. Practice losing, daily if you can. You might be surprised how much you win when you do."
