We're often told, just like Isis Harris was, that you've got to go to college to get a good-paying job. And side note here, if you've decided that a four-year degree is what you want, we've got other episodes on that - how to return to school if you stopped out, how to afford college, how to study once you've enrolled. But this episode, it's all about the skilled trades.
