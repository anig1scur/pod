Lately, I've just been passively watching the latest Marvel thing or stuff I've got to watch for work. But I've been really interested in going back to high-school me and being intentional about broadening my movie-watching habits. So I hit up my colleague, Bob Mondello."

Devika herself makes sure to keep a healthy diet of, quote-unquote, \"highbrow stuff\" and \"lowbrow stuff.\" So I asked her about her approach. Does she come at a movie made by, you know, say, famed Hong Kong film director and cinephile favorite Wong Kar-wai differently than, I don't know, Adam Sandler's \"Hubie Halloween?\""

    {
      "author": "GIRISH",
      "text": "The idea that you need different approaches feeds into that idea that some movies are homework. And the truth is, movies can give you pleasure in a lot of unexpected ways. And people think that, you know, certain kinds of movies, like a Wong Kar-wai movie, is a serious movie."

      "author": "GIRISH",

You know, you might end up thinking that it's actually far more similar to, like, a TV show that you like. I mean, there might be aspects that will feel not unlike, say, \"Euphoria\" or \"This Is Us.\" And so I think that - I like to think that you should go to all movies with an openness to see what might move you and what kind of pleasures it might afford."

That's something that'll help you decide next time what you want to watch. That's still something you can talk about with your friends and figure out why you didn't like it. And I think we just need to be less scared of doing things we don't like and less obsessed with finding the perfect thing, which I think applies not just to movies. Like, we're - have you ever tried buying something online? Like, I spend..."

      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Here's our second takeaway - when it comes to finding out what to watch next, trust people over algorithms. And there's a couple different ways to do that. Devika isn't the biggest fan of using Rotten Tomatoes as a judge of quality, nor does she rely on whatever the big streaming giants are trying to push hard. Instead, she recommends that you find critics that you enjoy reading. Devika grew up in India, where she was allowed one international magazine subscription. She chose Time magazine."

And reading Richard Corliss' reviews really made me realize that movies could be like books, which had been my first love, that you can learn so much from movies. You can analyze it. You can parse it. You can debate about it. I vividly remember Richard Corliss' review of \"The Wolf Of Wall Street,\" which was such a controversial movie, the Martin Scorsese movie, and he had this fantastic review of it. Basically, he made this argument that Martin Scorsese had fallen for the con that, you know, the main character of the film perpetuates, Jordan Belfort."

      "author": "GIRISH",
      "text": "I know. And it was just this way of understanding movies, understanding that they have moral stakes and political stakes. And, you know, there's so much more to them than entertainment. And they can - they're still entertaining, too. I think that was a really important point for me."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "It's not a matter of choosing someone you agree with all the time."
    },
    {
      "author": "GIRISH",
      "text": "Finding people who can sort of maybe parse the movie a little bit for you, can add that extra context and, also, people you can start sort of internally debating against, you know, forming your own reads of the movie against someone else's take. For me, movies are all about the conversation that follows."
    },
    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "Right now, one of the best places to follow that conversation is Letterboxd. If you're not on it, it's a platform that lets you log all the movies you've watched and offer up your own reviews and such. You can also keep a list of all the movies you want to watch and make different lists and sort them by genre or length. Keeping a log like this not only helps you keep track of what your favorite critics are watching, but it also helps with that decision paralysis."
    },
    {
      "author": "GIRISH",
      "text": "If you're logging your viewing, you're archiving what you've seen, you also kind of get a picture of what have you seen more of? And do you want to keep watching things like that, or do you want to watch something different? What have you not seen so far? You know, how might you expand your taste? So I think just being intentional about keeping a record of what you see can also help make a decision that, you know, doesn't feel totally just like facing an abyss."

    {
      "author": "LIMBONG",
      "text": "There's also a ton of smaller independent film distributors and streaming services that have real, actual people who care about this stuff, thinking hard about their curatorial process. The big one is the Criterion Collection. On their streaming service, you can find a curated collection focusing on one director or one actor. Just looking at it right now, you can find a collection of Westerns that take place in the snow, movies about soccer and movies handpicked by actor Tessa Thompson. Also, the company Kino Lorber just uploaded a bunch of classic movies straight onto YouTube. There's also the streaming service Kanopy, which you may be able to access with just your library card, which are all great options for home viewing. But if you can, our third takeaway is - go to your local indie movie theater. Not only does it help filter out the tons and tons of movies available to you..."

But besides falling asleep, if you're at home, make sure the device you're watching on isn't the same one you get your Twitter and Slack notifications. If you can, put your phone in the other room.

And in this case, \"Babylon\" sits somewhere in that gray area of good, which is actually a great place for a movie to sit at if you've learned to love talking about movies. Don't feel the need to have, like, a hard stance on something immediately."

And if you're with the right people and you're having a good time otherwise and you can go out for drinks afterwards and smile about it, three cheers and hallelujah."

      "text": "So to recap, takeaway one - come at these movies with an open mind. Be open to watching new and different movies and root for them to win you over. No. 2 - trust people over computers. Follow critics. Find fellow fans you can argue with. Find out who the filmmakers you're fans of are fans of. And if you're interested in checking out Letterboxd, we put together a list of all the movies mentioned in this episode. You can find that at our website. Takeaway three - head to your local indie movie theater. If you're lucky enough to live near one, chances are they have a whole host of interesting programming available. And takeaway No. 4 - immerse yourself in a movie. Put your phone away. Watch it on the biggest screen possible. Eat some snacks if you're prone to falling asleep. Finally, share your excitement about films, even if you're, like, on the fence about how you feel about it."
