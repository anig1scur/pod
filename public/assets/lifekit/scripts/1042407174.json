But cultivated correctly, it can also be a \"beautiful opportunity\" to \"deepen our awareness of what we want, who we care about and who we are\". In this episode you'll hear how you can unlock jealousy's power.",

Then it happens. Maybe it's the wayward glance of an attractive stranger, the ping of a private message in their inbox or an invitation to hang out with that hilarious co-worker they won't stop talking about."

So, for example, being envious because someone else has a better body or job or car or house that you wish that you had."

    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "And as we mentioned earlier, that loss can be completely imaginary. Merely the perception of an interruption to a valued relationship is enough to spark that protective hostility, as well as feelings like anger, fear, judgment or anxiety that may be hiding underneath the surface - or all of those things at once. That's a lot to handle, but it's also extremely common."

      "text": "As a woman, as a woman of color, I think one of the things that I've had to explore in my own ancestry and history is that ownership is not just something that we talk about now in terms of relationships and being territorial. Ownership was actually very real. We owned people. At some point in history, women were the property of men, and people of color were owned by other folks. And so there is this cultural integration of somebody has control in the relationship and the dynamic at work."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "The bottom line here - it's completely natural and totally OK to feel jealous. It's what you do with those feelings that matters. If we can accept jealousy as another part of our everyday emotional spectrum, rather than glamorizing it or trying to ignore it, we can then unlock jealousy's power."

Jealousy is a wonderful indicator that we care about someone. We can allow ourselves to feel the jealousy. And then it's the interpretation, it's the meaning that we put on it that really starts to give it its weight."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",

    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "Misla and Hamilton both agree that while the result of jealousy is usually external friction, the cause is almost always an internal feeling of insecurity, scarcity or fear and is oftentimes a product of previous experiences. Maybe your partner was unfaithful in the past, or maybe you crave affirmation from your spouse, but their attention always seems to be elsewhere. Whatever your situation, everyone has their soft spots, even in relationship structures where jealousy is openly addressed or even expected. Take Jules Purnell."

And remember, married and monogamous, dating around, polyamorous - no relationship structure is immune to jealousy or hardship, and ego checks come with the territory. So before lashing out at your partner, make sure you've done your own work first."

And I had to dissect, oh, I want to go to a rooftop bar. I want to take a walk through Central Park. And so I realized, OK, I don't need to do all those things with her. I can go with friends out to a bar. I can go after work and take a walk. Some of those ways I can fill myself, and some of those things need to happen in partnership. And that's an opportunity then for me to have dialogue and say, hey, I'm wondering if we can build in more date nights. I'm wondering if we can actually have a night that feels extravagant once a month so that we both feel special."

And sometimes just saying the words aloud is a great start."

Just because that then actually makes it feel a lot better than saying, right now, I'm feeling vulnerable, I'm feeling insecure, I'm feeling jealous, I'm feeling all these things. I say, oh, I'm feeling little yucky right now, and so can I have a hug? And they'll be like, of course. They'll give me a little hug. And then I process everything's OK. Relax. Calm down, nervous system. Everything is fine."

Or maybe they just classify, like, a whole gender or a whole group of people. They say, I don't want you to text with any of those people. OK (laughter). We can immediately see that there are problems here."

      "text": "But that is, at best, a very cheap Band-Aid, and there is now very little discussion that can be had, very little individual work. There's very little meeting of the feeling where it actually is. And that leaves us missing the beautiful opportunity that jealousy is to deepen our awareness of what we want, who we care about and who we are. Because in there is a much more profound conversation about what our relationship is built on, what kind of trust we have, what our agreements actually are. And that's where we can start to actually use jealousy to get closer to our partner rather than as a way to control them."
    },
    {
      "author": "TAGLE",

Can you agree to a daily check-in text or two? Can you meet each other's friends; set up a no-phone policy after a certain time of day? There might not always be a perfect middle ground, but you can work together to get as close as you can to a space where everyone feels safe and heard. Misla offers a great example of a healthy ask rooted in self-awareness."

I would love every once in a while if you turned to me and said, I am so lucky. You are so sexy. I realize I need more words of affirmation. Is that something that you can do?"

      "author": "TAGLE",
      "text": "These days, social media is another biggie. Maybe your partner still follows an ex or two on Instagram, and seeing the face of an old love on their feed fires up your retroactive jealousy.

      "author": "MISLA",
      "text": "Think about when you've been with your partner for a while and you go to a party or an event and you just look at them from across the room. And they're laughing or joking, and the people around them are looking at them with, you know, adoration. And you think, man, that person is with me. You can experience that as well if you look back and say, wow, you dated all those folks or, wow, you did that, and now you're with me. Like, I get to see you as a whole person distinct from me, and that's pretty sexy. And so sometimes introducing some stuff from the past in a healthy way through storytelling lets us see, like, oh, you were somebody else before me. I want to know more about this person."

But I am so glad you are happy right now."

      "author": "TAGLE",

      "text": "In that dichotomy, there's definitely an understanding that jealousy is the bad one and compersion is the good one. In my experience, it is not an either-or, as in most things in the world and certainly in my life. It's really a both-and. Having that balance of compersion, being able to feel happiness for my partner, being able to, like, see and support their excitement at my best, I think that that helps - you know, I love them deeply. It makes me happy to see them happy even though, at the same time, you know, I'm also dealing with my own feelings of worthiness and insecurity. Both things are true."

      "text": "OK. I don't know about you. But that was a big, long emotional rollercoaster for me. Let's recap. Takeaway 1, jealousy is a completely normal facet of relationships that often spurs from our own sensitivities and insecurities. Before you take action, do your own work first. Takeaway 2, be careful that your response to your jealousy matches your reality. Keep your imagination in check. And make sure the stories you're telling yourself are true. Self-soothe and de-escalate when and where you can. Takeaway 3, if it's time to make a change, offer your partner solutions, not demands. Work together to find something that fits. Remember, you're on the same team. Takeaway 4, practice compersion. Finding joy in your partner's joy can loosen jealousy's grip."

      "text": "Hi. My name is Stephen Nazareth (ph). Whenever I go to bed, there's a task that I want to complete the next day - so for instance, if I want to run the next morning, I'll take my running shoes out. And then the next morning, when I wake up, I'll look at my running shoes. And I'll be like, oh, hey, yeah. Maybe I should go for a run. So that's kind of a way to - remembering what I'm thinking of the next day."
